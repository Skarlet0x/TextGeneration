4. Walk The Path Of Sorrow

In the Devoid of Sorrow
The Air and my Heart full of Luster

Behind the Mountains
There must be a key to the Gates

Right passed easy Talk
We can once again walk the Path of Sorrow
Let the Turn of Search bring you away

Ahhhhh!

Two Shades of the Midnight Fire
In the Night Sky
You waiting Child walk with me
Walk by Side of Fall
The Essence to open those Gates
And still we must walk the Path of Sorrow


3. Dark Medieval Times

The secret Lights in the Sky
Vision
All one
It seems

The Blades are sharpened
They will all learn
Yes, Destroy your Dream
Your Desert of Dreams
It's undeserved
For Dark Medieval Times

Here, upon the Hill
You all find Wisdom

Waiting for a lot of
Endless screaming

2. Ending

Desert of Dreams
Eternity in your Dreams
Here you are
Dark Medieval Times

Into The Mighty Forest

As I walk
With a Spirit
Into the binding Forest

In Fog and Darkness
I walk
I disappear
Into the mighty Forest

It's beyond the sweet
And tainted Landscapes
The Shadow walking

Your Sanctity
Soughts the Story
Of Generations

Wah!


1. The Dark Castle In The Deep Forest

Dark Forest Trees over the Funeral,
All day the Army ride
They moved in deeper
So Dark that they weren't even...
Too lead us passed this wicked Dense
I can fell the Presence of the Shadowthrone in the deepest Dark
When cold Winds Freeze
When Night came and dark Fog came over me
Let that Horde come to me
As they walk right by
When all the Death is near
I wander eternally
Invincible Fog is near
We walk the Fields of War
The Cloak of the Moon it can slip all them through
And the Flame is the Wrath of his Sword

2. In The Mist By The Hills

In the mist of the shadows by the river of the fogpalace
Two great spears and a flag of dominion and hate
Over the chasm riders of doom

And sometimes the water dares to reflect...
As days pass by and the light is becoming weaker
I can watch the death of the sun from my enormous view
Still sometimes I thought my own eyes were deceiving me

Many a misty morning's battle. Further on more experience
Soon it's time to hear the sound of the horn in far distance
The deathtone call for war

In the mist by the hills the day darkens
In this forest death rules
Over this chasm riders of doom and face him with a deadly pale spectre face
Grim as stone, ride to the deathfields... Blackness and doom
A total eclipse of the sun
Die by the northern triology in the mist by the hills


3. Woods To Eternity

In grey depressive autumn times I wander the woods to eternity searching for
him trying to remember while the same shy still rules the night
We knew then. That these were the children of god
The ones who betrayed me and my desire

This must be the desolate land. this is the kingdom of the shadowthrone
centuries have gone beyond time, and we in the land beyond the forest, we
burnt them in the purgatory, them the children of god. Barely forgotten these
times are, but not for a soul whose rest hasn't been found.

5. Dominions Of Satyricon

From beyond come the storms
Landscapes turn to ash before my pressured eyes
Nothingness turns to nothingness
And my imagination fades like dustclouds over
This deserted land feel to now satyricon
Wonder how stormclouds rage
And all you can feel is the cold winds of
Funeral times, timeless they are

He saw lived and died
In these dreams of demons
Wondering how he could open the gate to
Dark medieval times and bring forth to the domains
of satyricon, two great spears and a flag of dominion
And hate

Above it all creations fall
Living for the quest and the search
Dying for the key, living for the domains
Arise northern spirit and come forth under
The might of the castle satyricon

1. Black Winds

Summon thy hidden wisdom, gather the unholy hate
Winter is at hand, frozen my tears will be
Created by blasphemy
The edge of my sword, the powers of my mind

Winter is at hand, as two torches blaze in the dark
A warrior dressed in black, granted eternal life
Black winds blow my hair, as the voice of the night
Whispers my name

Blackened ground, misty sound
Hear the call for war, the master calling his
Warriors to explore by the sign of the horns
As the dawn arises the souls of a thousand
Young men shall go wild
As the fire shines into the night they're sitting by
The campfires awaiting the dawn


2. The Forest Is My Throne

Through years of knowledge, man rode the wings of evil
Through the enormous winter, three years without summer
Prepared for the battles of the north

I sat on my throne and watched between
The skies of a cold northern light
Knowing this was my ground, but those who turned their backs
Against my throne, only got my sword on their back!

I rose from my throne, and walked away with the wind
Through centuries of weakness
Only the strong follow me, on my crusade of darkness
In this land where the forest is my throne
I have come to re-hunt

4. The Night Of The Triumphator

Come come infernal war awake beasts of hell
free yourself from the chains that have been holding you for 666 years
We await sodomy and destruction

It is the night of the triumphator (starts the burning of heaven)

On this night in the pentagrams power we shoot the angels down from the sky
(and we) sodomize the dirty whores of babylon... on christian ground

On this night we torture the betrayers
Night night holy night of the triumphator
(rape the nuns, hang the priests, cut the throat of the crying christians)

6. The King Of The Shadowthrone

He wander the fields of death... In eternity wandering our own path
Which has been the quest of immortality
Yet to conquer for me, but dreams shall not be torn

He is spirit
He is stone
And he is immortality
The king of the shadowthrone

And even the conqueror (of death)
Fell as a stone from the mountain
And time led to destruction
Once he left, he knew then in the past
That the seeds should be worthless
Spirit rise from your rest and return for them

I am spirit
I am stone
And I am immortal

1. The Dawn Of A New Age

This is Armageddon

"And I looked, and behold a pale horse:
And his name that sat on him was Death
And Hell followed with him. And power was given
Unto them over the fourth part of the earth,
To kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death,
And with the beasts of the earth".

And then again "I saw and beheld, a black horse;
And he that sat on him had a scythe; And a crown
Was given unto him and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.
And there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black
As sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood.

And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth,
Even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs,
When she is shaken of a mighty wind. And the heaven
Departed as a scroll when it is rolled together,
And every mountain and island were moved out of their places."
Almighty mountains and rocks, I beg you fall on them.

For the great day of wrath is coming, and who shall be able to stand?

3. Mother North

Mother north - how can they sleep while their beds are burning?
Mother north - your fields are bleeding

Memories... The invisible wounds
Pictures that enshrine your throne (gone?)

A Future benighted still they are blind
Pigeonhearted beings of flesh and blood
Keeps closing their eyes for the dangers that threat... ourselves and our nature
And that is why
They all enrage me

Sometimes in the dead of the night I mesmerize my soul
Sights and visions prophecies and horror
They all come in one

Mother north - united we stand (together we walk)
Phantom north - I'll be there when you hunt them down


5. Immortality Passion

I am the beast in passionate pain
I am the grim being of the highlands
Of the other side...
I am winter when you freeze
I am the hammer and you are the anvil

Forever in warfare my heart is
With my passion of despair
Still though I was there when the hills were born
And when the wind blew for the first time
So there are reasons for my existence

Seems like I dwell in a circle
Somewhere in the Nordic Hemisphere

Where the howling winds rage
And the mountains are majestic
I can breathe and where there is
Human flesh I feel strangled

Open the gate to immortality
I stand proud awaiting the glory
Of a new morning... darkness

1. The Dawn Of A New Age

This is Armageddon

"And I looked, and behold a pale horse
And his name that sat on him was death
And Hell followed him, and power was given
Unto them over the fourth part of the world

To kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death
And with the beasts of the Earth."

And then again "I saw and beheld, a black horse,
And he that sat on him had a scythe, and a crown
Was given unto him and he went forth conquering, and to conquer
And there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black
A sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood

And the stars of heaven fell unto the Earth
Even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs
When she is shaken of a mighty wind, and the heavens
Departed as a scroll when it is rolled together
And every mountain and island were moved out of their places."
Almighty mountains and rocks, I beg you fall on them

For the great day of wrath is coming,
And who shall be able to stand?

4. Orgasmatron

I am the one Orgasmatron
The oustreched grasping hand
My image is of agony
My servants rape the land
Obsequious and arrogance
Clandestine and pain
Two thousand years of misery
Of torture in my name
Hypocrisy made paramount
Paranoia the law
My name is called religion
Sadistic
Sacred
Whore

I twist the truth
I rule the world
My crown is called deceit
I am the emperor of lies
You grovel at my feet
I rob you and I slaughter you
Your downfall is my gain
And still you play the sycophant
And rebel in your pain
And all my promises are lies
All my love is hate
I am the politician
And I decide your fate

I march before a martyred world
An army for the fight
I speak of great heroic days
Of victory and might
I hold a banner drenched in blood
I urge you to be brave
I lead you to your destiny
I lead you to your grave
Your bones will build my palaces
Your eyes will stud my crown
For I am mars the god of war
And I will cut you down

1. A Moment Of Clarity

Without beginning, without end (our lifeblood)
the road for the spiritual outlaw is never ending
and so is the hunt for all those answers
the devil may hold your truth, what a fucking relief it would be (to know)
bluecold and the grim truth stands before you, all you ever wanted ?

Descend and fly away to another day, another night
sleep forever or serve to justify

The brand that you wear speak of what you are made of
It leaves you like an open book for everyone to read
Is this it, is this what you wanted?
The eye of the rest on your back
To be a part of the masterplan is the only way
to spiritual hell
drink to that and never forget where you came from
cause there's no such thing as one way ticket to hell
what a fucking relief that is

Descend and fly away to another day, another night
sleep forever or serve to justify


2. Inri

They say that you've born to the eternal kidness
And that was conceived by divine grace
That came to finish with the pervertion and evil
And died on the cross to humanity save
The pervertion and evil only start after you came
Because you was only a crazy lier
False saints were with you on your insanity
And the more stupids belived on you
Thieves and corrupts
Now eleited priests
They sellet pieces
Of cloth saying it were yours
The chief of insanity
Now is reigning at home
The pervertion and evil
Only start after you came

4. Blessed From Below

Salvation: A merciless hand
from below holding the melancholy of
a million strangled souls Part, melancholy

So warm and glorious
embraced in a black mass
a mass which holds
the pain of oppression Part, oppression

I'll reach out for that salvation hand
and accept its shinig blessing
so that I can bear their pain and longing Part, longing

1. Tied In Bronze Chains

Sinful woman walk with me cause I'm the wolf on your shoulder
but complain not to me, cause I'm the accuser
If you dare to withhold the immense power and the greed
you shall walk among us to subterranean fields

Why don't you come with me
and dance the snake pit dance
rhythmic moves to the eerie bells, the boiling blood
evils breath on your neck, the morbid rite
I'm tied in bronze chains
(so) where do all the flowers come from (in October 1997)
I am tired, should I care anymore?
The rusty claws who reach for me are too far away
sense no anger for that, be at one
The sleaze on the Wall is all gone (anyway)
it's just flowers, flowers
Come, come let's join the orgy
decay and wine, sodomy all the way
no rest for the holy
forbidden fruit is always best
dirt 'n filth tastes so good

I see the cross of Peter overwhelming their coward countenance
Oh you're so damned clean, now take my dirty whore, hell fire is inside her
contaminate the clean, woman. Let him feel you're venom
It's the only way to release the chains
My candle is burning at both ends, I just want to be released before I go
It's a harsh voyage, to the land of sin
I had to make sure to bring 'em down with me
I am the last of my kind and I'm tied in bronze chains

2. Filthgrinder

Filthgrinder, no-love machine, cleaner
unknown to remorse and pity
cynical, electric fuckin' murderer

What a scenery, the heavy pulse beat of the
Unholy Alliance and the white fear
Take a look around and understand, (that) your days are numbered
the demon on the Wall and the ticking clock
closing in (on that final) grasp for air, do you still believe?
The future beast is rising and tyranny has come for 777 years
reach out for mercy, it's just a bygone anyway
Filthgrinder - practice aggression
Filthgrinder - protect the wealth of the Elite
Filthgrinder - tremble upon the ugly
True-born creature, twist that Firm grasp of yours
like in days of old
He can feel it, he knows they can't
to be in league with the underworld can't be mistaken
you don't believe, you know!
He chants a primitive gospel, so very hard
Yeah!
The mechanisms of destructive behaviour can be an art form in itself
The beast risen represents no so called dark mercy
evil knows no good, good knows no evil
but a saviour he is in all forms, but religious
a Grand engine carrying years of built up Hatred
and Powers. You know that, isn't that why I can smell your fear?
Your heart trying to rip its way through your chest

Filthgrinder a beastified being risen from the collective
hatred of an oppressed people.
A people representing Pride, Dignity and Honour!

4. Havoc Vulture

Wonder how it would be to be the great Redeemer
the one to bestow upon you life and death
the one to poison you when you're down
or to be the one to hand you the crown of thorns
when your hands are sore
(and) to save you from the everything you care for
Are you bitter when you see how pale you are?
Do you feel hate without direction?
A kind of seed inside you that never blossoms
It is at the gallows end one forgets that everything
has to have a greater meaning
An unrecognisable call drags you towards the unspoken word
to suffer Martyrdom for the others
The Saviour cut off your wings, somehow just to remind you that He exists
Those who wait for His salt with open wounds have a way to go
the shadows of your must rest (first)
Though I ask, why do you dig your own grave when others do it for you?
The force behind the hit can not be mistaken
'cause He's the saviour with magnanimity and
...a light in the dark

Maybe it is intimidating more than lighting the way,
where is the road going? To a place where you can wash the blood of your hands?

Where did the knowing go?....With a saviour to transcendental kingdoms
or to the valley of the forgotten?
behind the vault of the sky's mystery lies a dream
damned or saved, how could we ever know?

5. Prime Evil Renaissance

He would kill the white-draped men
He would kill all holy men
He would kill the powers in control
to waste these jokers in this pathetic game
He would choke the sleaze pig
He would shepherd the sheep off the cliff
He would crush all organs of speech
to start the process of renewal
He would avenge the dead
He would crave divine protection
He would sing the songs of darkness
to call upon it to manifest
He would "mirror" himself in the tundra frost
He would rape its virtue
He would disable its ways of hurting him
to give him that advantage
This would be the way of the misanthrope
in order to create you must destroy
We would greet the nuclear morning mist
We would smile at all life dying
We would cherish each and every moment
and celebrate the return of Sin
We would bow to the planet's Iconoclast
we would march under the flag of Dominion and Hate
we would burn all conspirators
and their works with 'em
We would reveal the only truth
we would make them really sorry
we would show them Sovereignty in true fashion
and then be a reflection of their loss
We would soak up the last joys of our lives
we would Hail that grotesque destiny
we would walk on to the last glory
and hope for blessing to come

6. Supersonic Journey

A rotating silver-colored plateau, drops that dance down the columns
Blue, cold and the raging star wind
glowing colors at fearful speed
indistinct pictures of prophets and visionaries in a galactic fog

in outer space on an axis
In another reality on a supersonic journey
inevitably he can see it, the lights are going out and he knows
if he just could make us understand
In the emptiness there is nothing that can draw the picture you want
just a stillborn child on hands that fumble
Raging, raging at incomprehensible pace
the colors blinding, the plateau falls in outer hell
They disclose that we had to die... We bit the hand that fed us

in outer space on an axis
In another reality on a supersonic journey
Is this what is yet to come, or a madman's reflection of the soul?
As when his heart cried out in pain when he perceived what
burdens we were to bear

8. A Moment Of Clarity

Without beginning, without end (our lifeblood)
the road for the spiritual outlaw is never ending
and so is the hunt for all those answers
the devil may hold your truth, what a fucking relief it would be (to know)
blue-cold and the grim truth stands before you (all you ever wanted?)
Descend and fly away to another day, another night
sleep forever or serve to justify
The brand that you wear speak of what you are made of
It leaves you like an open book for everyone to read
Is this it, is this what you wanted?
The eye of the rest on your back
To be a part of the masterplan is the only way to spiritual hell
drink to that and never forget where you came from
cause there's no such thing as a one way ticket to hell
what a fucking relief that is
Descend and fly away to another day, another night
sleep forever or serve to justify

10. The Scorn Torrent

Break down all conventional forms and create chaos to reinvent order
Rebel against all circles and dead ends
fight your way with your mind set on the masses
execute with mechanical aggression
arrogance and extravagance
march on unapproachable
shut out the outside pressure
or are you too weak?
when shall they see the real darkness?
In a world where our justice is replaced by mercy
...mercy for the inferior
The serpent's maelstrom is already here
just waiting to be unchained
so feed the fire with the vile and let sincerity rule
why can't you see that the armoured hostile aura is meant to keep you away in all your primal simplicity
(it seems like) fright procreates the downfall of the mind
such a sin isn't it... the stagnation of it all
You must collect your instruments of battle
and protect, to emancipate that which lives within you
Rebel against the chains
Break down the embodiment of your pain
Attack with robot precision
Rise and Shine under Wings of Divinity
Now pick me up night and whirlwind
and let me ride with you
to peace of mind and nothing to Rebel

1. With Ravenous Hunger

On my signal, unleash Hell

Who made deceit into the ultimate award?
Who told you, you're not poisoned?
I see the snake coiling inside you
I see the venom in your eyes

You can't stab me, or even touch me
You can't betray me, it's just an illusion
I built the pain inside you
I spawned the snake

It will gradually tear you apart
It will eat you from inside
No longer sweet revenge
No longer emotional triumph
Pity you, led to believe (in own willpower)
Pity you, (resting) on withered laurels
Can't you see, the world's on fire...
Can't you feel, you're getting burnt!

There's a day coming, for me to rip and to rape
There's a winter coming, for you to be swallowed
Swallowed by emotional cold
Swallowed by a power much greater than yourself

Who made deceit into the ultimate award?
Who told you, you're not poisoned?
I see the snake coiling inside you
I see the venom in your eyes

You can't stab me, or even touch me
You can't betray me, it's just an illusion
I built the pain inside you
I spawned the snake

2. Angstridden

Born into a field of flowers, to slowly wilt away
Sheltered by wings, delicately smothered by blindness
Released among the wolves, thus molded by resistance
Ridden by the clawed hoofs of tyrants

The fruit of other worlds, but grown by loneliness
Concealing a black soul, and but sensing the beyond
Uniquely grown from within
Shimmered by a darker night, but left to solitude

How can one disclose a darker night,
If one but rests?
Or evidence the suffering,
By wordly gauge?
Or comprehend the long-drawn agony
When pain and evil never trod one down

Like a warring sun, from a better kingdom
Beautiful, free, of different steel!
Dearly prized, and equally broken
He should have gone free of you!

An emotional tumour, gnaws from inside
Of heartless, spineless treason
The darkest night now weaves its loom
Soon to release its spawn

3. Fuel For Hatred

Scornful, relentless memory
Ripped of all but drive
Undressed by betrayal
Zero tolerance for the souldead
Wish I was the violence,
Inflicted upon you

Fuel for Hatred, air raid siren to mankind

Little you,
Still like a claw in my eye
Pulsating organic rage
I should have let you off of the hook
Mind drifts
Into dynamic pain
Universal onslaught
I'm on my own (One soul, one hate)

Fuel for Hatred, air raid siren to mankind

Damnation, holocaust
Devil horns for you to ride
Time for the angel
To spread his wings and fly
World opponent,
Wishmaster of gruesome pain
Stormtroops' frantic fury,
Demoniac spitfire!

Abortion of religious life, distinguish the rot
I hate you
To a level of intoxication
Don't feel alone,
I've got enough
I wish you slow death,
Slow death by grinding

Fuel for Hatred, air raid siren to mankind

4. Suffering The Tyrants

Crawling down the road of life
Another hopeless speech
Gruesome soul numbness
People stare, do they know
I am suffering the tyrants

Every gesture is a malicious attack
A firm fist of misery
But it shall not coincide
With the Lion's downfall

There are no tears
No feeling of guilt
Nowhere to channel the anger
Nowhere to leave the pain

How can they feast upon the Lion without knowing?
...He will eventually rise again

Hunt him down (when He is at his weakest)
Tempt him down (on His knees if you can)
Stronger than all (so it's futile)

All there is left (right now) is personal pride
Enough to return with rays of light

5. Possessed

Mourning the decay
Bitter ungodly enemy
Cast into heavy woe
Left in the corner of the world (we are possessed)

Out of the maze, with clearsight - at the brink of one's abyss
Out of the maze, with clearsight - cold eyes at the world
Out of the maze, with clearsight - disbelief and scorn
Out of the maze, with clearsight - not poisoned by your fraud (we are possessed)

The realisation of the position
No longer vulnerable
Having played the music no one could understand
Serenade to the devil's den - He, the final frontier!

Defaming judgement
Upon the starving souls
Mourning self-made pestilence
Cannon fodder for the
Apocalypse

A haunt for every unclean spirit
Lord of the flies or kingdom of death
Circle the prey, show them your eyes,
They bear witness of centuries of might

Predecessor who blessed us with grace
In sempiternal fight
Excessive aggression -
Fire is the definite sign of rebirth!

The elders' electrons channelled through you
Carried by thy night Supremacy
Born to win this battle, defeat is the tongue
Of the whore

6. Repined Bastard Nation

Do we need another bastard nation...
Another force-fed disgust
Do we need another bastard nation...
Aiming at us clinically
Like an insect-swarm
Towards the shapeless mouth
Of a dead whore
We need the spirit, the voice, the angel of light
Arising from melted mass
We need the spirit, the voice, the angel of light
Taking invincible shape
To standing ovation
Repossessing night and her hand's godly touch

The unbearable feeling of hitting that
Dark wall is a scene that must come to an end

Eartly decay in front of our eyes
Now, now it's killing for a living

No more repined bastard nation
A generous gesture to a people so blind
No more repined bastard nation
Fumbling, descending, away from the light
It takes a non-poisoned creature
To withstand a monster that has grown and spawned,
A darkness, I can not tolerate
A darkness we must bury
Do they feel, do they absorb our pain...
The search to justify one truth
Do they feel, do they absorb our pain...
The greater understanding

It takes a non-poisoned creature
To defeat and destroy a monster,
That has grown and spawned
A darkness, a darkness we can not tolerate

7. Mental Mercury

Past tense icons
Locked up in cages
A disgrace to us, (and) a vital sight of (impending) doom
Upheld by insane aggression
No tender repentance, (just) denial of ugliness
With the rain come their conquest

Behold those who ride black winds
Satan, the kings are heading home

No harmony on the horizon
When our haven burns silently
An image of absolute mutiny
Against those who pertain to the dearest hell

Monotonous graveyard plains -
The soul exile
Quintessence of pain -
A higher form of suffering!

(Why should man be protected,
What has he done to justify it?
This is why we embrace animals;
They represent the innocence man doesn't have)

Monotonous graveyard plains -
The soul exile
Quintessence of pain -
Satan, the kings are heading home

8. Black Lava

Grey heavens, no light shed
Bleak day, change is ahead
Oval mountainside, naked cold
Unreleased powers, no fright

Slide down sorrow, smell what comes with the breeze
Cold chambers, punishment awaits
Hollow tone haunts, anticipation's choir sings
Turn around, face the depth of inner sanctum

Autumn in the air, (the) smell of Black Metal 90-95
World moves, in mysterious ways
Body onwards, mind drifts
You die, then we hail (to our relief)

New age dawns
Face all wrath
Sickness; won't understand,
Burning first
Grace falls
Volcano shaking
Fates are being sealed

Heavens blunder,
No turning back
Will you or will you not
To heroism walk

Black Lava, drifting down the mountainside
Black Lava, you can't fight

Pernicious flow, redemptive perpetuity
Unholy drive, the gods arrogant grin
If my world's a joke, do you see them smile?
Hellbound me - on a throne of gold

Wastelands prey on dying cattle
Desert sucks on poor man's thirst
Glimpse of glory, walk ahead
Slaves of Nazareth, can not be fed

Black Lava, drifting down the mountainside
Black Lava, you can't fight

9. Live Through Me

Gods of the land remember him
For he has served the purpose
And sworn to thee

Master of the mountains
Spirit of the sea
Bringer of justness
Lord of the dark ways

Flee from him, for he is pure
As any soldier can be
Fighting a cause
Free as any wanderer

Armed with flame
Blazing force
Risen from time
Rebel's son

Remember the fallen
And what they did
Memory is how to
Understand the future

Troubled by those
Whose spirit is torn
From mind and body
Never surrender!

Destined by the elders
And by them acclaimed
Ascending from the abyss
Sunset for the Triumphator

10. Existential Fear-Questions

The soul (when) stripped of all
Lies in the hands of what?
Inner chaos roars, nerves boil
Now, where to go...

A lifetime of slow inner death,
How torture is that?
Chocking fear, is life real?
And what is dying?

What if void is a shellshock's aftermath?
What if Eden is all poisoned fruit?
What if hell is forever pain?
What if life is a blindfold, and death is punishment?

Global puppetshow, made by hands of transcendental divinity
Blood rives cascades, could be virtual reality
World war slaughter, could be the final act
And graveyard paradise could be eternity's curtain
Who are the ones with the keys?
Will they lead us...
Life is nothing but untimely answers
To our existential fear-questions

Fear - reared its ugly head
Death - came to me on a somber morning

1. K.I.N.G.

Bloodshot eyes - metal skin
Serpents tongue - dagger claws
Dragon wings - crooked horns
K.I.N.G

Beholding the might
In its dawn of grace
In its beauty and light
In its pride and glory
Rushing torrent - time and space
Elder lords - crack the soil
Gone or dead - you've never been
Kingdom come - hear the roar
Climbing down
To rule the earth

Bloodshot eyes - metal skin
Serpents tongue - dagger claws
Dragon wings - crooked horns
K.I.N.G

Upon high places
With their heads up high
With their lives at stake
With their blades at hand
Triumph come - beyond the gate
Giants rise - from the pits
Worlds collide - chaos reign
Dawn of gold - age of gods
Climbing down
To rule the earth

Bloodshot eyes - metal skin
Serpents tongue - dagger claws
Dragon wings - crooked horns
K.I.N.G

Lightning strikes - wake up now
He the fourth - hate the weak
Summon all - make the signs
Legions march -earth to void
Climbing down
To rule the earth

Bloodshot eyes - metal skin
Serpents tongue - dagger claws
Dragon wings - crooked horns

2. Storm (Of The Destroyer)

Overture of evil
Aggressive force
Stamp of authority
The world is his stage
Always rise when down
Never bow to doubt
Pain is temporary
Pride is forever

The Destroyer

Resisting fire
Firm as a rock
Smelling fear
Unleash the storm
(If) they lust for death
Give them death
What they want
Is what you'll give

1. Commando

In the house of lords
We control the movement
Of your limbs
There is endless beauty
In the might that we possess
Dragons are creatures
Of (our) own imagination
And dragons... Dragons breathe fire

We throw stones in the water
And see the waves
That we create

We push - Push hard
Predatorial instinct, built for the kill

Commando - Stones in the water
Commando - The Age of Nero

Keep looking for morning
In the shelter of night
(While) we renew our strength
Transfusing my blood

New layers to the core
I am ready now
As the world kneels

We push - Push hard
Predetorial instinct, built for the kill

Commando - Stones in the water
Commando - The Age of Nero


2. The Wolfpack

She's roaming free
Tucked with a lifeline
She's haunting me
Rocked by the netherworld

Consciously comes to me
Down on her knees
Painfully she moans indeed
Rapidly aggressively
Daggers shine and daggers kill

Nightfall (the nights that gods can't undo)
Chaos Alive (looking for the faith I had)
Demonic (their faith brings me another battle)
The Wolfpack

Your path is lit
Look for the alpha
Drugged to the bone
In the devils grip

Consciously comes to me
Down on her knees
Painfully she moans indeed
Rapidly aggressively
Daggers shine and daggers kill

Nightfall (the nights that gods can't undo)
Chaos Alive (looking for the faith I had)
Demonic (their faith brings me another battle)
The Wolfpack

Warcraft of the witch
Ceremonial ritual
This is the dream
That came to follow me

Nightfall (the nights that gods can't undo)
Chaos Alive (looking for the faith I had)
Demonic (their faith brings me another battle)
The Wolfpack

3. Black Crow On A Tombstone

Hidden under its wings
The darkness you wish to hide
Bearer of ugly truths

Grey...
Somber morning
Through blurry glass
The black crow

Here comes the messenger
Found bringer of dark days
Here comes the messenger
Black crow on a tombstone

Stare
That reeks of death
The posture
Makes you tremble

Here comes the messenger
Found bringer of dark days
Here comes the messenger
Black crow on a tombstone

(She'll) seek
And find you
Make you remember

Here comes the messenger
Found bringer of dark days
Here comes the messenger
Black crow on a tombstone

Hidden under its wings
The darkness you wish to hide
Bearer of ugly truths

On a grey
Somber morning
Through blurry glass
The black crow

Here comes the messenger
Found bringer of dark days
Here comes the messenger
Black crow on a tombstone

4. Die by My Hand

They ride the winds
Avoiding resistance
Choosing not to fight
Wanting to live
To lie another day
Pale figures in life

And so in death...
A painful existence
Wanting so much
Yearning to be
You know you lose
And I'm glad it hurts

Die by my hand
As close as you'll ever get
Die by my hand
Accept defeat and find peace

You seek the truth
That you define
Waving the flag
Of the pitiful (kind)
You could never prepare
For my battle cry

Die by my hand
As close as you'll ever get
Die by my hand
Accept defeat and find peace

5. My Skin Is Cold

My skin is cold and the birds fly free
Over my head, where winter grows
A heathens call, stand up or fall
This world is yours, for you to rule

This, the blood of sin
Flows freely
This, unstoppable force
In the naked flesh
My skin is cold - your skin is cold

Black metal rock and a scent of leather
And bloodstained gold
With rain and wind come times of change,
and dream come true
I go with you, on the path we make

This, the blood of sin
Flows freely
This, unstoppable force
In the naked flesh
My skin is cold - your skin is cold

Snow covered mountain
I gaze in awe
Wondering who and what was here before
I made my mark on that sacred soil
This phoenix rose from a pit of pain

This, the blood of sin
Flows freely
This, unstoppable force
In the naked flesh
My skin is cold - your skin is cold

One nations man carrying the weight,
of a peoples disgrace
This is the turnaround!
Driven by birthright and godsent will
The time has come for you to rule

This, the blood of sin
Flows freely
This, unstoppable force
In the naked flesh
My skin is cold - your skin is cold

6. The Sign Of The Trident

Axis of faith
Raw, and untamed in spirit
To do and undo...
We chew this world
And Spit it out

Opinions rise and opinions fall
At the end of days
The trident stands tall
With limitless range
Illuminates all

Answers to no one
Certain and bold
It makes us
Stick to the cause

The wear and tear
Of agony stretched
It makes us...
It makes us stick to the cause

The dustcloud left
From a charging bull
Broken bones and bridges burnt
Fuck them all - It never stops

The Sign of the Trident
Stands paramount, eternal and tall
With tears in our eyes
Above them all

Answers to no one
Certain and bold
It makes us
Stick to the cause

The wear and tear
Of agony stretched
It makes us...
It makes us stick to the cause

Nothing, no nothing can challenge this call
Larger than life, soul and sound
Of undying tribal war

The cracking whip
Held by and iron fist
Determined and loyal
A constellation of bright shining stars

Answers to no one
Certain and bold
It makes us
Stick to the cause

The wear and tear
Of agony stretched
It makes us...
It makes us stick to the cause

3. Our World, It Rumbles Tonight

Smoke
Across the night sky
Tears the black open
Glows
Towards the earthbound
Breaks the light down

This moon
This moon
This night
This night
This sign
This sign
That symbolizes to me what must be done

Shadows that mirror and nurture the spirit

My world crumbled
Your world
A star
Our world, it rumbles tonight

No mask
Pure will
One hand
One blade

Shadows
Sink

Summon the unwanted
And gather for a (final) journey

My world crumbled
Your world
A star
Our world, it rumbles tonight

4. Nocturnal Flare

The beast of the land
It stood right here
Twilight of the gods
Serpents - those with fangs
To conquer, to rule, to own
No days have passed
To conquer, to rule, to own
Daylight's gone
Conjure, the past
Mortals - those with spines
Gathering of men
March! onwards to death!

Hear the call from the voice of the elders
The tide will turn whenever you want
Nocturnal flare - hallow cries
Nocturnal flare

Echo the howl of the lonesome night
Naked trees and shivering leaves
Nocturnal flare - hallow cries
Nocturnal flare

To conquer, to rule, to own
No days have passed
To conquer, to rule, to own
Daylight's gone
Silence, hear the hooves
Of the legion
Blades, jingle, angel of death

Man must answer to the sign of the end
Such is the law of the universe
Nocturnal flare - hallow cries
Nocturnal flare

The grave of our kind, lies open to us
And nothing can hold us back
Nocturnal flare - hallow cries
Nocturnal flare

5. Phoenix

Into the night
My long suffering friend
We'll be reborn again
Right here where everything ends

Face to the sky
A trail of smoke in the air
Pass into emptiness
New life's awaiting you there

Slave to some wretched old imagination of yesteryear
All that grows in the skulls of the living are flowers of fear

The morning red
A sun god calling you back
Down through a thousand years
White embers whistle and crack

Await the dawn with her kiss of redemption, my firebird!
You were the queen of the souls of men before there was the word

The morning new
The morning red
The fiery promise
Mad swirling smoke
Wheels round her head

Dedication to the queen of souls,
Her lost disciples
And when the fire's work is done
Our time to be reborn

By pagan streams
A wind whips the leaves from the trees
And it is revealed to us
That we are dreams within dreams

Born from some wretched old imagination of yesteryear
Now all that grows in the skulls of the living are flowers of fear

The morning new
The morning red
The fiery promise
Mad swirling smoke
Wheels round her head

Dedication to the queen of souls,
Her lost disciples
And when the fire's work is done
Our time to be reborn

The morning new
The morning red
The fiery promise
Mad swirling smoke
Wheels round her head

Dedication to the queen of souls,
Her lost disciples
And when the fire's work is done
The phoenix now reborn

6. Walker Upon The Wind

In darkness
Underneath
The above
Swordbearer
Son of a tornado
He lies in the slumber of (dark) clouds

Born by a thought
He flies through the thunder of wars
Swirling
Ripping

Ultimate destroyer
Unspeakable avenger
Walker upon the wind
Hunting, piercing
(The) ultimate, roaring
Walker upon the wind

Son of a tornado
He lies in the slumber of (dark) clouds
Mourned, feared, adored
Accursed one, torn one, marked one

Ultimate destroyer
Unspeakable avenger
Walker upon the wind
Hunting, piercing
(The) ultimate, roaring
Walker upon the wind

7. Nekrohaven

I gave you a sign
with my bare hands
from the underworld
I drove you around
with no remorse
and now I´m dead to you
You saw my head spin
with your own eyes
I´m not immortal
it´s broken you down
and torn you apart
and now I´m dead
Find me
take me
to the void. To the crooked nest
to Nekrohaven
The bestial screams
a life devoted
to the occult
the flickering lights
my dream came true
and now I´m dead
Find me
take me
to the void. To the crooked nest
to Nekrohaven
Now all men weep
in my bare hands
´cause the lion
no longer roars
and now I´m dead

Find me
take me
to the void. To the crooked nest
to Nekrohaven

8. Ageless Northern Spirit

The winds
Sing their song
And I listen
They always sing
For those who listen

The lonely dark
Morning haze
Mountains who speak
Of time before time
Scattered snow
Hold the fort!

Winter - wake me
Fire - burn me
Fearless with horns
Ageless northern spirit

Faint cries from ocean birds
Rays of light down the valley
Tore me out of my rhythm
Listen...

Winter - wake me
Fire - burn me
Fearless with horns
Ageless northern spirit

Introspective and grateful

Winter - wake me
Fire - burn me
Fearless with horns
Ageless northern spirit

To the front!
Stand up!
With heart
Tuned in
Ageless northern spirit


9. The Infinity Of Time And Space

Take me down to the core
Of the innermost deep within (myself)
Show me and help me capture
The seed of my existance
And understanding of my purpose

Guide me in grasping the nerve
Of my own melody
Golden star
Shining light
With power to dissolve

The most scattered mind
Into a state of contentment

Hunter, warrior
Crawls his way through the universe
Hunter, warrior
The stage is yours
I can no longer rule

Who made who...

A few naked trees in an open field?
Or something with a higher purpose
And sense of being

Dance with me
And try moving
To my rhythm
You and I...
We can move together, together

Hunter, warrior
Crawls his way through the universe
Hunter, warrior
The stage is yours
I can no longer rule

Make the world spin and heads bow
Know that devotion is our daily bread

Faitful ye, hear me now
The golden star is here

Hunter, warrior
Crawls his way through the universe

I must carry this torch with him
Bring us all together to the finish line

Our hate shall win
Our evil shall grow
To fix itself in young souls

The final war shall we win
And the blood of the good shall fall as rain
Their short souls shall be gathered together

We shall reign over chaos and everlasting night.
We shall forget our feminine absent mothers,
And end all

A kingdom shall raise itself
In the ash of burned homeland
There is only one master ruler
We pay tribute to you Satan the king of the strong

Your time is has come

At last the raging wind of the storm
Makes the tide crack
Makes the ocean overturn a treasure
Has soon frozen every forest pond
And the snow covers every peak

Stripel's warrior stout he was
Who placed his trust in an ancient time
Wanders off to Dead Island rift after his bane
Grand battle

Howling bleakened far-away lands
Over-abandoned and dark earth
And good for fathers who are victorious
The Norwegian ocean's twilight fjord

The journey through the dim is gray
For me it is a shell of forefather's life

Howled bleakened far-away mountains
Into a gray-turned night
I journey over bleakened far-away mountains
And here in the darkness I am abandoned

Soon snow has burdened every branch
Soon King Winter will have conquered earth
Here where the old ones once fell to the ground
To lay the island deserted
And make it clean

Over bleakened far-away mountains
I sojourn into its dim darkman's* words
Over lands where fathers' struggle has been victorious
Where viking swords left a clear mark

Forgotten times on Jotuns path
There over high cliffs and mountains
Has marked it with dust and ashes
From when Alders' herds wandered these grounds.
Here Gandviks Cave trolls stamped forth
In an evil and large goblin-herd
Where rangers found a big wisdom
About the lands forest-life and dark sides
Here on the path who creeps eternally forth
Between banks where they difficult still
Can be seen in the horizon
So great it must have been
To look out over all this
And to wander so alone and free
An autumn evening in cold and light mist
Like many before me have experienced
And many before me have appreciated
But memories are forgotten as time passes by
And little is here that once were
Here like elsewhere leaves have wizened
But fallen down on a collapsed earth
Where dreams and lives have passed away
But maybe between a rock
Or behind an old buch
Sits still...
And waiting

Every tear is frozen
Our soul is linked
Our hate is bloody
All happiness is gone away
All laughter is gone away
All life shall end in death
In a cold and deserted landscape
Shall the black horde step from
Our lord shall rise
Up for all time, rise his kingdom again
Our struggle shall be rewarded
Our names shall be written
Our minds shall pull the bough
All morality shall be cast away
You want but you die of shame
Now is the time come
Yes break the word of the good
Let us for all time become rulers on this earth

Endlessly you fought on the steppes
Unmercifuly you ravaged in the montains
You took you victories with storm
Cruched your enemies with your hand
Oh, Attila!
Make me your servant
Oh, Attila!
Take me into your army
You lived in the darkness
You wandered in greif
You plundered with steel on horse
A proud and stubborn king
Which conquered each fortress
To so hoist the banner to feast
Attila, king of the Huns
King of warriors, our father
You gathered your strength from the darkness
And on plundering I now with you go

Long... there away in darkness
Through treetops there moonlight shines
Long... there away in all mist
Inside my soul the black anxiety tears
On the moss-grown stones they show themselves
When night-darkness has fallen
Echoes... from their horror-full moanings
Endless... you can hear
In the horizon far away
Is glimpsed the talking mist
Hordes of fire ride in a flock
By daybreak they gather by a hidden-away headland
The ice-cold snow
Has come
This time
In everlasting snowfall

Glimmering moonlight drifting up above us
Paths covered with frost leads the way
Black souls now travel through the night
In through the valley of fog

All has blackened
All light has faded away
Pure we now enter the kingdom
Remembering that our tracks will be followed

Surrounded by sorrow's haze
The journey moves on
As a band of corpse-dressed ghouls
We wander the wolverine's home

The breeze takes us over Norwegian marshes
Past every misty hamlet
With the hate in our angry minds
We now leave for never to return

Come young brother
Give us your pure youth
Lay your life in our hands
Fight our war with us

Let our sorrows darken your mind
Let our soul be torn apart
Feel the night wrap itself around you
Forget all love

No tears shall fill your nights
Enter the ring of Brotherhood
No weakness shall be found in your soul
Strength shall wander by your side

Come
Share your hate with us
Leave your weak body
Do not be bewildered by enchanting words
In death lies all power

Follow
Follow us
Through the hall of evil we travel!
Where the inverted cross leads the journey!
From the Omnipotence of darkness!

On the flesh of Christ we spit
Let it rot!
A symbol of disappearance of goodness
A play that is ended

Bring forth our inner anger!
Show the way for our hatred!
Give eternal suffering to God's souls!
In the paradise of evil they are yours!


The echoes of silence sets the hour.
Gagged in the chains of "depression", I fall away.
No more I will be bolted fast in the anchor of "melancholy".
But finally get my longing "fulfilled" - for leaving.

Did I drink too much from the goblet of "lifehope"?
Did I take the vanity of joy for granted?
For my battle against the pain of emptiness - this intoxication of the angst of death,
Is all that is left... that is mine.

In my loneliness I still know,
That I have none to thank but myself.
This is why I remain calm,
As the rope is tightening around my neck.

Silent witnesses can not give comfort.
The ordinary man in the assembly of the "gravechoir".
Tha land of perdition
I created by my own hands.

This intense attraction to the portals of death
(I have as) A wandering study of tearful black mass.
Controlled since the dawning of time,
But something I never would let go.. was the sorrow.

My soul did glow
And my mind did yearn
To get hold of a Christian fuck
In the cold darkness I waited with the wind
It howled as if possessed by the devil

I waited
Ahh, I waited!
Time seemed eternal
But finally I got sight of a poor one
I raised my clenched fist
And screamed

Weak Christian!
Die tonight!
I shall tear your soul apart!
You will feel the poor I was granted from darkness!
Your time has come!
So has your faith's time...

...so has your faith
Pray for mercy you pitiful fuck
And my laughter shall once again resound
Loud in the cold of the night
Where frost will freeze your last...
Tear...

Weak Christian!
You died tonight!
With a might blow I cracked your skull
A bloody slaughter
From which voices will forever resound in the Kingdom of darkness

Through timeless, decayed dreams
In a moist autumn wind over deserted plains
Against Sorias mountains
I come, a Devil's Knight

Smooth is the rune on the high mountain
Washed away by rain and winds
Enchanting force of evil lurks
Here at Trollhome's moudly gate
Perplexed by the dark building
Made of stolen gold from the pact of light
Used as mockery to make their walls fall

We ponder over this kingdom
So beautiful, filled with timeless dusk
As a star in the gorge of emptiness
Brings forth a nightly wondering
Over thoughts from a long gone time

Straight to the sky it is erected
From the endless black memories of time
Storm blown out of the black inner
Has rock rolled from heath to bottom
Wondering and anxiety gather in the night
In the darkness looming about the spire
For no day knows the way here
No light can sneak in

Where sorrow has conquered all joy
And built a land on human's earth
Filled with ice-cold splendor and glory

Step on to my throne pale corpse
Fall to your knees in respect before my feet
Accept my cold kiss on your forehead
I've laid the path leading to hell

Lift your swords for battle,
Proud men
Let the massacre begin today
Decapitate every Christian
And rape their women and children

Every Christian cross you find, you shall turn
Every building under God's name shall burn
Every Christian man's grave shall be desecrated

Every night you shall awaken human beast
And feel the blood burning like fire inside you
Every night you shall rave like a mad in the streets
And annihilate every sign of life

Hear my speech human beast
My words are your future
I am the embodiment of Satan
I am your master

I am evil
I am Antichrist

In the darkest of darkness I intone
In my halls silence steps forth
Fallen angels are guarding my gates

In the beauty of valley of death
My soul has gone astray
While darkness and sorrow ruled
The fire of hate was lit

In the black silence of the night
My silence self steps forth
In the darkness a corpse burns
Another black soul has returned(home)
In silence we observe the journey
The journey of our sorrow-black brother
And no tears fall
When ashes are united with dust
We shall all share his fate
We shall all follow our friend
When the bells of judgementday chimes
We shall all return
To rule

A proud knight returns home
From heaven to heaven on a self-made bridge
From the endless battle against the pries of light
And now he shall rest

See into the inner of the mountain breeze
Where its life has sought shelter for a sun
Which in end will go dark with the eternal night
And prevent our world from blooming and growing

See the satire of the eye
Where remains of good is chased away
And is blown away in an open grave
Until the last light has been put out

With powerful blows to human's heads
The knight rejoice in a dark mist
High as the sky, wandering over his own star
Glaring at a world covered with ice

Over innumerable fallen man
Who sowed the growing seed of life
He wanders away from the last war
The might prince, the bloody thorn

Devoted are we
To the emperor of the dark
The power of the almighty
(Which)leads our minds
Into battle
Against the good and their lies

Though the enemy's army is poor
It is big
But we shall take them all
Gather them up
One by one

The hope they saw in God
Shall I disappear in an ocean of thorns
The thorns their fake messiah
Once felt nailed to his skull

Heaven shall be torn
And a fucking thunder
Shall boulder and roar
His powers will go weak
Where the front of dark
Conquer the plague of light

Eyes will run in sorrow
When they realize (that) their god
No longer can help
The hope they found in God
Is gone and so it shall be forever

Now they follow their fake salvator
Who still carries a crown of thorns
But king he never became

The stench from the mysterious way, [refers to "God works in mysterious ways" or something]
Where preach and false hopes are bait.
Pierces through like a gift of bitterness,
And fertilizes the human rot.

Like a slave in the state of impotency,
"Advices" nothing but confession of defeat.

Retreat!
You are not worthy the gift of life.
Retreat!
You are not worthy the gift of life.

Because if the sign of the animal and the idol is ignored,
Great punishment will "eventually come to the guilty."

This pious pact's harmful inbreed,
Seeks shelter in the garden of Eden.
Where a proud, pure and upright master
Is not as easily pleased.

So when the thunder of armageddon finally roars,
Can man's "fantasy image be shown".
Every man with god-fearing hunger,
Will lose face and be devoured.

1. Mourning Palace

Daylight has finally reached it's end
As evenfall strikes into the sky
Far away in the dark glimpsing moonlight
Sickening souls cry out in pain

Whispering voices summoning screams
Waiting for Satan to bless their sins
Blackhearted angels fallen from grace
Possessed by the search for utter darkness

Hear the cries from the Mourning Palace
Feel the gloom of restless spirits
Hear the screams from the Mouring Palace
Feel the doom of haunting chants

Eternal is their lives in misery
Eternal is their lives in grief
Abandoned in a void of nothingness
A chain of anger, a fetter of despair

In this garden of depraved beings
This unsacred place of helpless ones
Satan blessed the creatures
Inswathed them in endless night

Whispering voices, summoning screams
Waiting for Satan to bless their sins
Blackhearted angels fallen from grace
Possessed by the search for utter darkness


2. Spellbound (By The Devil)

You have returned to the torture-chambers
To find peace among the rotting corpses
You have returned to the execution place
To inhale the smell of blood

Death and terror rules the land
We have been spellbound

You have returned to the hidden graves
Only you know about
You have returned to to face your victims
And feel sensation of violence once again

Death and terror rules the soul
You have been spellbound
By the Devil
Murderer, you have returned
To create fear and sorrow
Death and terror rules the land
We have been spellbound
By the Devil


3. In Death's Embrace

By the light of the moon
And the beings of the night
A curse has been laid upon us
To seek and tear celestial gloss to pieces

By the power of death
And the shadow of the reaper
A call has been brought upon us
To complete the infinite fall of heaven

Without the wit or will to end this journey
We continue travelling towards our faith
Harvesting helpless Christian spirits
Raping the sanctity of saints

The heavenly father is stretching his hand
Pathetically begging for mercy
We spit and piss on his sacred flesh
As we breathe the breath of the unholy

For with the sign of the pentagram
Hellfire rage is for us to come
As we shall wander the pit

Unhallowed by the infernal one
We are forever captured
By the embrace of death


4. Relinquishment Of Spirit And Flesh

King of tempests and storms
Lord of innumerable figures and forms
Blessed with thy cold I am
As I upon the shoulders of mine
Bear the burden of Thine

Once I got touched by a fire from beyond
An invitation to darkness of which I could not resist
Caressed by the feathers of the fallen
I took the fate in my hand

My raging Commander
My constant Shade
My soul's Persecutor
My eternal Divinity

Revealing Thy powers in visions and dreams
Invoking your magic at night
Honoured I am to mission Thy word
Within a creed is sworn of majestic might
An infernal allegiance in which I pay my share
An unholy awakening inside of which I intend to bear

Beholding Thy commotion
I entreat You with devotion
I subsume Your might with strength
I will carry on with You as my guardian
Against the lambs of the light

Possesses by the true god of earth I am
Possessed for eternity


5. The Night Masquerade

A scarlet sunset
The threshold to nightplay
A sinful oath is to be sworn
A beckoning bloodlust
Among the seekers
Tyrannic hunger yearns

A gathering in flames and fires
Devil's daughters dance
Scourged in filth obscene and lewd
Longing to dark desires

The nocturnal beast appears
In an evil despotic shape
Expectant watching gracelessly
Before demanding the sluts of lust


"Come forth harlots, let's begin!"


"Rise and give praise in front of Me
And receive eternal life from Me!
Welcome my spirit in honour of Me!
So drink of the blood I provide you
And you shall all forever wander in
The shadows of death...!

"Oh yes, Master! Let us receive
Thine offer and drink with thee!
And become a part of Thy realm
With lust, sex and sodomy
For we are those who seek life eternally...!

"Blood is life and it shall be all ours!"


6. Tormentor Of Christian Souls

I could drag you to my chambers
And strip you naked in darkness
I could pull your fingernails out one by one
And rape you till you find no hope

I could rip your guts out
And let you watch me
Sacrifice your unborn child
I could leave you to starve
And even bring you to total silence
...but I won't

For I find no pleasure in your physical pain
I want your Christian soul to crumble

Your fucking soul

When I have seen your church go up in flames
And you are weeping I will laugh
When I have seen you mourn over loved ones
I will feel bliss when your mortal soul is in ruins

I will grin in the shadows
For that gives me pleasure...
...tormenting a Christian soul


7. Entrance

Soul on departure six six six
Onward onto another existence
A trip far beyond all pleasant dreams
A voyage through desolation sights

Inner transformation
Subconscious flight
In the glance fields of fires
In the distance meadows of might
Where minds being enshrouded in a complete night
The fading of love, life and light

Wandering an endless journey
Dead within a trace
Entering a lost dominion soulless and free
Visiting a foreign place but yet so known
Another dimension opens for me to see
Heaven sure ain't made for me to be

Soul on arrival six six six
One short step from unhallowed ground
The ground of a Kingdom Come
Dead spirits communion
Unorthodox profane void

Gardens, temples, palaces
I have seen them all
In search for insanity, sanity slowly drowns - In trance


8. Master Of Disharmony

Master of disharmony
Welcome my tainted soul
Take me from the hordes of the living
Into the blessed darkness
Master of disorder
Take my impure flesh
Lead me unto the path of temptation

Save me from cowardness

Master of sin
Take my cursed heart
Bring me where I can find salvation
For I am the damned

Master of death
Take my pitiful life
I am enslaved
I shall never forget the pain

Master of sin
Take my cursed heart
Bring me where I can find salvation
For I am the damned

Master of death
Take my pitiful life
I am enslaved
I shall never forget the pain


9. Prudence's Fall

He became the swarm, indeed a pitiful imitation
To the verge of a quiet glance, an oracle without eyes
Darkness... My precious companion, even thou cant see his face
Salvation turned to bleed despair, compassion fled...

Sadistic delight flowed, like Hell burned brighter
Existence woven into darkness, prudence did fall

...In Satan's beauty, life was found...

A flow of orgasmic fire, swept through the cosmic night
I enthroned darkness triumphant, with the searing trident of the Inferno
Gaze towards the Heavens, an you might catch a glimpse of Me...

10. A Succubus In Rapture

Illness and plagues, torture and blight
Is what she brings
Mocking holy standards, deceiving feeble fools
Is what she loves
Granted with powers, gifted with magic
Watching the world through raven eyes

Damned woman mischievous whore
Heretic princess
Devil's own

Her seductive elegance
Excites your weak flesh
Her diabolical beauty
Enchants your bewildered mind

You damn woman
You mischievous whore
You heretic princess
You are Devil's own

A serenade made out of black magic
She has learned to set souls afire
And makes sure that you never
Will leave it's trance
Her diabolical beauty
Enchants your bewildered mind

Glowing eyes, staring eyes
Manifest of evil presence
With entities swept in disease and decay
A fall from paradise beyond redemption

Wrathchild's afterglow

He who speaks of nightly treasures
He who wraps the serpent around my neck
He who pours poisonous wine in my chalice
He who lets me serve and slip away

...and so i will take shelter
In the absence of the light
Hiding like a masked miniature in the dark
A revenant without relief it seems
For the art of becoming a progeny
and to be raised in such curse

Is to forever creep among naive mortals
Infesting the dead in herdes

His grandeur of guidance in roundtrips obscure
He who immerse my hands in sullen thrills
His paths on wich domination linger
He who dares to prove the sanity of mine

He who speaks of nightly treasures
He who lets me serve and slip away

Black unearthly void creatures crawling
Forbidden forgotten fairly underrated
Bastards in the shape of angels holding my hands
Passing me what is left of the wine

2. Behind The Curtains Of Night - Phantasmagoria

A mental inner vortex
as possessions through a wolf's eye
Envisioning the eclipse
No longer to be blinded by a sunrise

In this final benediction
Confronted by mirages of imminent mortality
Time's set to end the suffering
So follow, I will cherish the secrecies of hearts

Chased by the black sheperds
Behind the curtains of night
Been found as a tool in their seduction
Fatal haze

An escape into abomination
Perished to phasma
Asindrome of another aeon
Soul-obsequial inhesion

Resurged in torrents of abyssmal thoughts
Lost in a helix, blackest might
In stealth i do seek deliverance
In phantasmagoria, vortex utopia

3. Dreamside Dominions

When the ghastly mourners awakens from sleep
And the volant funeral crows are watching
Like evil omens in shadowed murmur
They welcome me again

Agonized and flattered to once become
A part of this horror scenario
I descend with arms open wide

Armoured and filled with painful pleasure
Reflecting streams of monstrous mirages
I will not hide

Losing control in seductive madness
Spiritual revelations, apocalyptic hypnosis
Dead colours appear within unshallow graves
Alone in awe I face abhorrence below

Trapped inside to suffer in silence
Torn apart in mind and sense
Baptized in this nightly glamour-
Rites of splendid essence

Agonized and flattered I once became
A part of the horror scenario
Armoured and filled with painful pleasure
I did not hide

Now when the gates are no longer shut
I withdraw from the light of the sun

4. United In Unhallowed Grace

Unfolding her carnal desires to me
With tempting eyes she does receive
A hunter of the night devil's whore
May her cursed beauty haunt me forever

We embrace the madness gathered as one
Mourning dead passion...she comes to me
A fate awaits us in the night
In the ruins of creation we will unite

Unfolding her carnal desires to me
With tempting eyes she does receive
A hunter of the night devil's whore
May her cursed beauty haunt me forever

She comes to me - a shining beacon
Confused by the sensual innovation
Passion ... towards the image of mortal evil
Passion ... embraced by the image of united death

The enigma lies broken
Searching for those precious moments
Reaching for a higher state of existence
Like a newborn migrant in the void

I am smitten by the forbidden fruit
Possessed by moments of dark splendour
To walk the nightmare terrains forever
The enigma lies broken

Possessed by moments of dark splendour
To walk the nightmare terrains forever
United with new unhallowed grace
This cursed beauty haunts me forever

5. The Promised Future Aeons

Erotic and dreamlike still in its mortal disguise
A passionate ritual in the ruined gardens theatre
The painted angels - Shadowed high above
Once they gathered to worship at the picture of me
Like a whisper where there are no words
Appears the perplexed - The statue of might
In the cradle of the next generation
A spiraling ruin - Lost in the gathering dust

...the faces you saw in the withering garden
I witnessed the flickering - made to look like stone
Quivering like little figures lost in broken flames
Never to forget again the names carved in horrid flesh

Those words drawn in water - Become our legacy of fantasies

Burn the pictures
So unexpected in this strange deserted place
Once opened its secrets would become the world
Its attributes would continue to unfold forever

"Through the fabric of the promised future aeons
I offer this suffering of my unwanted father..."

...and the stars did wander - Separated in the forbidden universe

6. The Blazing Monoliths Of Defiance

With hearts of midnight, brightened by His infernal light
We stand as a monolith of wrath, united under the goat of a thousand young
Two horns thrust upwards in defiance, three inverted as the trinity denied
A phalanx of mourners in black, falling towards nightly terror

Unleash the tempted beast, raised your horns in prideful blasphemy
I'll be your guide into the glorious darkness, and enchant you like a taste of sin
Unleash the tempted beast, chant theron in words of blazing scorn
Grant me my dark desires, strengthened through the power of Satan

Take pleasure in the torment of the wretched
and rejoice in the delight of the flesh
Behold the face of Satan
and walk the fields of erotic fire

Hunt the heavens ...

Godless temples beckon
Through gleaming scapes of horrid nightmare
Gathered between symbols and signs
A glow of new light is born out of the night

Give into your lust and carnal desires - In twisted blood-dripping ecstasy
In the name of Satan - I lead you into temptation

7. The Insight & The Catharsis

Passenger on confessional course
Unlock with the key you behold within
Repair the shadow of your mind and come awake

Oh, dreadful angel of mine
Enrich me with the vastness of being

Rigid father, teach me how to comprehend
I'll commit myself to understand
To be faithful and the instrument
So that the ones with blindfold can see what I have seen

That there is nothing in between
For I am the accomplice...

Aghast and tender, indulged in sin
Embraced by loneliness, legions who grin
I blunder into the realms of slumber
I collide with the obscure
And see the last fraction of light go by

Plundering the sanity from the insane
And providing appearances in black
Carefully swept in decadent spheres
But faces in this world always remain darkened

In circles of dominance, emotional deeps unite
Fiction and transcendence woven together
In the essence of purity lies wisdom
Join the forces, the spiritual black dimensions

What more do you need of proof
Human hands conforming cloven hoofs
For I know the secrets and lies behind all truths
Knowledge is power and the power is mine
It's all mine

So let the children come to me
And share the limitless ways to infinity
Escape death and disease
And behold youth and vitality

Oh, dreadful angel of mine
Enrich me with the vastness of your being

Rigid father, teach me how to comprehend
I'll commit myself to understand
For I am the accomplice...

8. Grotesquery Conceiled (Within Measureless Magic)

"In the shadows of my gallow
I'd rather absent the hallow..."

(For) Thy presence made pleasure of pain
(and) Thy madness turned sanity into vain
Profoundly wicked owner of souls
The mysteries of Thy creation beheld by ghouls

Diabolically disguised heavenly bodies
(and its) atrociously desired primordial elements
Plunging through the confused heart of sulphur
In all this darkness, how can man see

"Pour misguided fool ...
It is not God you are talking to
I am not impostrous, hiding behind pearly walls
However, I am still yet to be found, known
I shall guide you on your midnight-ride as the sun fades black
(and) beyond your grotesque imagination
my name will be revealed...
The blod of Christ can't heal your wounds
Give me all of yours, and I'll give you mine..."

I am the hidden fantasy
In the secret of my knowledge
There is no God but me

In this shadowy world all are nameless
Outstanding, dresssed in majestic splendour
Touched by the flames of eternal fire
How I long for your embrace, uttermost desire

9. Arcane Life Force Mysteria

In perplexed dementia, where sanity is my vanity
With honour bear the mark of Satan
Triumphant beast in heaven defeat
Disguised in gloom, wear the mask of Satan

Ride the beast through paradise
Still vipers these mortal burdens
We arise as the portals take form
I leave my feathers again

Infidels and scarecrows all fallen from heaven
Captured by the sin of the beast
Mesmerized in total chaos
Engulfed in an overflow of selfish might

Swept through arcane mysteries
Forlorn in a maze of torment
Raped by the sanctity of the unholy
Reveals a Hell I never dreamed of

Bewildered by the arcane lifeforce mysteria-
I shed my skin once again

10. Masses For The New Messiah

In massing darkness we stand united
Raging above inferior sheeps
A convoy of souls swept into the night
Hearts strengthened with black fire passion
In us is fulfilled the prophecy of satan
Evolution of the inner shrine
In us is mantained the revelation of satan
Innocence brought to an end
In honour of thy unearthly creation
We bring forth thy divine form
Vanity throughout any conceptions
Blazed and bound for the days are coming
Infernal madness,unholy ascendance
Christian death abound in mouring perversion
Cherished sacred icons torn to pieces
They'll chase the serpent in everlasting nightmare
Disharmonic illusions of strings bending loose
Wrapped,penetrating skin
Listen to the music of their agony
Eyes made of glass,mirrors within

2. Blessings Upon The Throne Of Tyranny

Infected by invalid behaviour
While capturing the stench of divine putrefaction
Confess to slavery for the world saviour
Give praise and inhale the corruption

The Enfeebled provides the fool
The Disabled provides the tool
The Apathetic demands the affection
To those suffering from their own satisfaction

Devour in self-deceit, conjure the righteous plague
Testify today?s contradiction, glorify tomorrows deed
Inconceivable moral priest, hide in preferable dress
Invite to another pleasure feast, the concealment of joyful laughter

The decrepit innocence of your correctness and well-chosen
Elicits the source of the need for immediate forgiveness
Submit to no grace but the spiteful of your disease
Apply to join the unlimited disgrace and a settlement in the skies
And turn the confusion among your children into self-stimulation
The incarnation of your prostitution, the true Evil in disguise

With the ignorance from your cross as the witness
The truth of your tragedy make you justice
In your mirror the high spirit of kindness
Looks like malice

Condemnation of life by the living dead
What a premature judgement, contradiction to the core
How unfortunate I am, cursed to spend time on a battle already won
The shame that will be guarding your grave says it all
Retreat to the crypt and make it worthwhile
Recall my sins furthermore but still be watching yours with a smile

3. Kings Of The Carnival Creation

Incarnated marvels simplified
Effects from such a disconsolate kind
Impotence of the once so perfect living
Erase and rewind

Stand rigid for the next battle
Peace means reloading your guns
The love for life is all hatred in disguise
A carnival creation with masks undone

In search for the guidelines to the gateways of sin
through mires of misanthropy with wrath in mind
Sophistication as cruelty and perfection as virulent truth
Confidently dawned, to pick the best of enemies
An abyss womb stretched wide open, exposed to retaliate

With the stigma feasting upon your flesh I wish you well
Thorns from the fountains of fate licking lepered skin
Worshipped by anyone's mass on our planet hell
What on earth possessed you

Consuming illusions made from hysteria and swallowed tongues
Devoured by doubt, conducting arts of misconception
Testimonial sufficiency declaring numbness of all perceptions

Glance into the blackness hidden beneath your surface
And enjoy the suffering, sanity drained in disrespect
With such bedevilled faith in good, subsequently trusting evil
Next step for mankind will be the last seasons in sin

Left are the kings of the carnival creation
Carrying out the echoes of the fallen

Sense the withering eternity as it fades away
The ultimate graceless voyage of all times
Only death will be guarding your angels, silently
Cripples joining arms in clamour
Institutionalized for the rebirth, the herd will be hunted

4. Hybrid Stigmata - The Apostasy

The apparition of two faces in disgust
Invisible but yet so clear
Reflections seen by a fugitive
Trying to escape the looking glass
Blood runs from open wounds of false flesh
The one in front of the mirror exceeds the image
Eager to leave further but chained still

To crumble into such nothingness
A despairing fate, for your lies
To pretend is the lunatic's legacy
Privileged to bolt the nails of heresy

Born lifeless into a world of coma
As the chronic sufferer trapped in paradise lost
Missing insinuations of what life was meant to be
Angels and demons, a march man's bewildering hosts

The charlatans and deceivers walk the line in prejudice
The narrow slits the veins in search for the crown
Profound impatience makes the blind struggle in stupidity
The paradox of the daily prayer, diffidence is Confiteor
Phenomena of ironies, cast the litany aside
How intelligible, blessed be the forgetful

Holding the banner high, unrestrained
Slowly abandoning the surface in contempt
Still in costumes to please the ways of living
Witnessing the details of defilement, intoxicating

Make sure to be pleased with the ways of your death
For in days of reckoning and when the twilight torn is ticking
Elysium is halfway and as an answer to the plea
You're destined to yield fragments of Hell in return

Leave unnoticed with the perfect conscience
With the strength of the spiritual eye
Spirits of the token unchained and free
Recover from the philanthropic macabre frenzy
The pale dove grins, black at heart ready to flee
Demon to some, angel to others

5. Architecture Of A Genocidal Nature

A dismal universal hiss, the sound of public scorn
The brush that sweeps across the spectral fields
This landscape is not without a sense of epic wonder
A vast scale that places this sprawling underworld
Into a realm of frames

With a blood-storm fading into the distance
Floating without directions over this smouldering landscape
Caught in a moment of transformation
These shades of anatomic malignant nature
Approached on another in an unpleasant way
Frozen in the act of speech, desperate to express it's state
Created in a shape to accommodate a wide variety of demonic forms
The realm of the benighted aristocracy of evil most pure

This is where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep

Emerged from the depths of the earth gasps
It rages against mankind, to annihilate the earth and worse
It spills the blood like rain, the beauty of death it represents

Devouring their flesh with a razorblade smile
Genes would still blindly carry on smouldering ember of hell
Limned with gold leaf, the scarlet brush
That sweep all traces of time, place and pattern

Total death in every nation
Monuments of vanquished civilization
Just as brilliantly removed ruthlessly eliminated
The cornerstone of human emotions
Has now been drained away
I saw death of a most uncommon nature

6. Puritania

We do away with your kind
Countdown to exterminate the human race
4, 3, 2, 1

Let chaos entwine
On defenseless soil
Remove errors of man
And sweep all the weakening kind

I am war, I am pain
I am all you've ever slain
I am tears in your eyes
I am grief, I am lies

Bygone are tolerance
And presence of grace
Scavengers are set out
To cleanse the human filth parade

I am pure, I am true
I am all over you
I am laugh, I am smile
I am the earth defiled

I am the cosmic storms
I am the tiny worms
I am fear in the night
I am bringer of the light

Earth successfully erased.

7. Indoctrination

Oh, look at those lifeless leaves
All their precious pride is taken away
A lost creation for a graven image
Trembling of nothing but their own fear

On behalf of water made to wine
Elements of deception must entwine
Righteous greed and derangement divine
Vacuum is given to the blind

To surrender to a faith so fake
To not comprehend while you're awake
Thrive on your deity for heaven's sake

Do loose your battle before actual birth
For some sheep need the company of a shepherd
To face the scorn of the earth

Existential parasite drama across the lands
What a relief never bother the why's
Investing illusions and folding hands
The passion for mankind's ignorance feeding you lies

All those naked faces, empty shells
Procreation of the mind put to rest
Crippled and caged, anaesthesia adjust
The lambs of slaughter preoccupied in disgust

8. The Maelstrom Mephisto

Ride the vortex winds with the beast inside
Cast down all memories from a past and future world
The cynic icons and the cryptic writings
As a picturesque creation in force and spirit
Against their reason and will, it is time
Give darkness it's passion plea

The venomous tongue
The inevitable poison
Paralyze the angels
Freeze the forgiven
Baptize in fire
Unleash the devil at heart

Unleash the maelstrom mephisto

So sinner, mourn well
Make all the swans suffer in hell
The maelstrom of the mephisto left the trace
To revel and feast in undelivered grace

Pledged to judgmental arrogance in
Drawn principles of ignorant falsehood
To comprehend that the sin of life is life itself
A tyranny in torment, an inner-sanctum stealing sleep

In the dimness surrounding the towers of the castle
Where the ravens spread their wings out wide
Dwell in depths of the darker self at any shore of infinity
And watch the relentless paint the soil black
What is being formed echoes throughout eternity
As the painter chooses color no more

Hold your shadows close when the comedy is over
As the days of mourning seem to be the days of joy
Fragments fell from the sky in order to penetrate the eyes
A convict wallowing in a lifetime of lies:lies

9. Absolute Sole Right

As cyclones detach from the world above
And all the other worlds beneath them flow
Time winds caressing the dust of cold memories
Sought, to strive in twilight mist and penal fire

As daylight suffers, night time recollects
For what wind hath drawn near, so near:

Death has a contract on life and hell in-between
What was once not certain is now foreseen

When the pendulum is in it's reverse factor
Rivers run red and skies turn black
Accuracies of bloodbaths liberate from within
Conquests of a crooked cross and its coming loss

A magisterial maintenance of diabolic education
Where the opposite of innocence paves way for intelligence
Where pearls are chained for each tragic event
The glorification of deviance in progress

Liars in wait tries to quench their thirst for more
Drowning victims of a parallel universe
The scum of the earth, a rejoice of fouls
The world hates you for being precise

10. Sympozium

Chains of despair
Cloaked by darkness
The thundering echoes of great destruction to come
Mankind's mysteries
The dying world

Madness in it's sweetest form
What shrivels and dies must face the tempest
The angelic heaven bows to the ultimate truth
And melancholy grew

Anticipation mender through madness
Condemned to the same horrid fate
Insanity applauds
How sharp the awakening
Pale as disease
Mocking:Maddening:
Give up the ghost
Cease the gloomy awakening

History foretold
The hidden stigmata
Totally annihilating the ecstasies innumerable
Materialize the vision
Give up the ghost
Cease the gloomy awakening

12. Devil's Path

Thousand different paths
So many sterile ends
I chose the Devil's path

Never shall the sun kiss my face
And caress me with it's burning light
For I dwell in the shadows
And sleep side by side with death

In dark desire I embrace the whore
Giving her an escape from an unworthy life

For with the appearance of the Fallen Angel

I serve Satan
I serve Darkness

I am a prince among the damned
As I've been for eternity
A monarch in a dark paradise
Cursed by life and the living

Oh tremble not my immortal heart
Though you beat in the shadows of death
Eternal life is the blessing
And I shall rule for another thousand years

I blew out the light
Abandoned Jesus Christ
Christian life forms' grief's
We buried their belief's

Waiting for their saviours rebirth
The dawn was soon to come
The dawn would soon be gone

There in that formless abyss was I made
A partaker of the mysteries averse

13. Burn In Hell

Welcome to the abandoned land
Come on in, child; take my hand
Here there's no work or play
Only one bill to pay
There's just five words to say
As you go down, down, down

You're gonna burn in hell
Oh, burn in hell

You can't believe all the things I've done wrong in my life
Without even trying I've lived on the edge of a knife
Well, I've played with fire, but i don't want to get myself burned
To thine own self be true, so i think that it's time for a turn
Before i burn in hell
Oh, burn in hell
Take a good look in your heart; tell me what do you see?
It's black and it's dark, now is that how you want it to be?
It's up to you; what you do will decide your own fate
Make your choice now for tomorrow may be far too late

Hear no evil, don't you
See no evil, don't you
Lay no evil down on me
You're gonna burn in hell
Speak no evil, don't you
Think no evil, don't you
Play with evil, 'cause I'm free

1. Allegience

Cuddled through a cold womb he was
Pitch black and without sunshine rays
Hell patiently awaiting him on blood spilled soil
A noble grief stirred heart, always ready to die

In sinister systematisation, submission is golden
As an apprentice to violence, slaughter and bloodshed
He was like an object that is being processed
A force-fed destructor ready for abomination

The vast solitude in him witnessed it all
Those self afflicting eyes
And their fear painted faces
Made out of utter discipline, failure unacceptable
Hosts to oblivion
Exploring the darkest of places
Stench of rotten flesh breathing down his neck

Every day seemed like an endless night
When would he ever wake from this void
No other voice than his own will ever tell
What was real and where he had been
What he had done

Did you bleed for the cause
Like the rest of his men
Did you capture the euphoria
How it was like to kill
Such a necromantic force behind it all
They sure did battle till the end

But when came all the glory
And who got spared to carry his body
Just pure death and too profound to be shared
Was it all a fabricated vision in his memory
To serve the wastelands of insanity
At the front

Life forever lost its innocence
Never to see the light of day again
He pondered his last few steps
Into the realms of death
With his hands bloodstained

Courage and consistency
Bravery and valor
Honor and pride
For what was it all worth

2. Progenies Of The Great Apocalypse

The battle raged on and on
Fuelled by the venom of hatred for man
Consistently, without the eyes to see
By those who revel in sewer equally

We, the prosperity of the future seal
Cloaked by the thunders of the north wind
Born to capture the essence of
The trails of our kind

Zero tolerance must be issued forth
Behind the enemy's line
So it shall be written
And so it shall be done

Discover and conceive the secret wealth
And pass it unto your breed
Become your own congregation
Measure the sovereignty of it's invigoration

We, who not deny the animal of our nature
We, who yearn to preserve our liberation
We, who face darkness in our hearts with a solemn fire
We, who aspire to the truth and pursue it's strength

Are we not the undisputed prodigy of warfare
Fearing all the mediocrity that they possess
Should we not hunt the bastards down with our might
Reinforce and claim the throne that is rightfully ours

Consider the god we could be without the grace
Once and for all
Diminish the sub principle and leave it's toxic trace
Once and for all

3. Lepers Among Us

Annihilate!
The commotion breeding the perverse
For bloodbath is on your doorstep
A mass impending threat
The perfection of religion
Becoming our death

Do not respond blindly
To growing gardens in decay
Stand guard when visitors fall silent
Blow the candles out, end the road here

No solace will be found
Within elements of the tribe
When covered with filth from all sides
Compassion will fail

Their promises are honored
In a mind controlled state
The absence of reality, reason and logic
Prove failure of faith

Enriched by the presence of it's clarity
Darkness descends, everyone dies

For wisdom aligns in our favor
Illuminated before our eyes

Uncover!
A new beginning, the inevitable dawn
Justice will be given where justice is due
And guide the righteous ones
Back to the final resting ground
To perceive the truly hellbound

Demonstrate superiority
A grand gesture of liberation need no judge or jury
Demons rate inferiority
Scatter the remains of the prey

Rise up
Let us fight
The thought away from our backs

And seed
On a cursed land
A lineage of pain

Then to burden
The of the merciful
Who believe in
The bread of the soulless

For the faith you posses
Is nothing but disgust and arrogance
And your need for knowledge
Is an abundance of mockery and desecration

The pain in my heart is not thirst
For a heavenly body

Nor is the failing search for angelic power
It is the fire and it burns
It's just that you
Are in its way

Take part in the shadow of guilt
Please your soul with the wonders of sin
For where will you be
When the lamp is extinguished

But death comes not
With our message
Reverberations from the splendid inheritance
Will redeem the eternal corruption

Bring judgement over heads other than your own
Where you hide your shame in songs of praise
Then you shall taste the fruit
Of your own passing away

Like a flock of hellspawns
And stewards of the son of despite
We parry their guile with the magnificence of disgust
By the evidence of our heavy burden
Lies their mind drowning
Left dessicated without power

5. For The World To Dictate Our Death

Let us sit by and watch
Death and destruction's devotees revel
Let us sit back and witness
Innocent semen being poured

Into the arms of Armageddon
Let it pour, more and more
Pure fucking Armageddon
Let it pour more and more

Reason faithfully defiles
On bloodstained hands
Where graceful motion
Are lost arts

There are only battles to be lost
In the kingdoms of the blind
For those who seek salvation
In the dust of the earth
Will only find wrath
In the sands of time

Engulfed by the desert
We taste death in the dry heat
The disciples of prophetic ablution
Had sworn to let the skeptics bleed
For great are their love for warfare
Henchmen of the disastrous creed

Watch us all celebrate in their name
The lambs of our time being slain
Awaiting the final perdition
Defeat against all and everything
For whatever adorned righteousness
Justice never wait for the guilty to speak the truth

For mankind so hated the world
That it gave all it's begotten sons and daughters
That whoever believed the lie
To perish and receive everlasting hell

6. Blood Hunger Doctrine

Man and his faithful ethics
Intoxicated by the fruits of the earth
Diabolical fanatikism, so cold and grim
The perfect perversion, bestiality incarnate

As instruments of torture
And leaving no room for sympathy
We bring forth the monstrous birth
To the worlds light

As all great art is made from suffering
So are we
Good in nature, but evil by our own free will
Incestuously created by the will to kill

Time is here to walk the final abyss march
Bound to the force of the last holocaust
Pour free the gifts of grace
And slaughter the entire human race

Not permitted to redemption
When pain rises high in purgatory
A reality so convincingly justified
Feeding from Death Cult's gown

We bring forth monstrous birth
To the worlds light

Unclean is the unfolding and thought of the act
Without limitations in unknown ecstasy
Nor a justified wish of giving birth to offsprings for God
Voluntary infected and soaked with acid
In fleshy sweetness
Imprisoned by lies and disobedience

Man's fragile behaviour
Must be strained with honor and glory, it's told
But goodness brought nothing but eternal evil
When the tyrant of Eden granted the fruit

Wisdom is freely enriched in the multitude of the Beast
When heaven's glorious injustice
And pompous mercy
Invokes discardment as we are seen

The spark has started a fire
And suffering in the will of pestilence
The pathetic slaves kneeling in shame
Born with sin and mercy

Descendants who swear the oath
With a promise to undo the peace
To crush the richness of heaven's slaves
And triumph in coldness in honor of the Beast

The chalice of wrath is flowing over
Strengthened by rioting devils' sulphur winds
Glowing, from the region of Belial's children
Bred beyond the defying mountains of indignation

The last signs of Christ's losing angels
Burning inexorably in the fire of the raven

Painful and pale is death
With haematemesis from the guild of light
Death's presence spares no one
The devout life is suffocated by its own tongues
The most precious soil is garnished
With poverty and hunger

Wings spanned over Darkness' deep abyss
Brought to life to devour
With pestilence and death
Indulging on sin and whorery

The supremacy of the bastards of the pole
Finds pleasure in the hierarchy of sin
An eternal life in paradise
Is perfection in Satan's dynasty

8. Cataclysm Children

Are you born from the abyss
And have you sought the creed
That drape the shadows
Of your own thought?

Is your heart mesmerized
By the fire that burns forevermore
And do the secrets from the flames
Hold the mysteries over which you preside?

Reveal the infantile wound and regain strength
Free your spirit from those who lead in praise
Recollect the anger and the hate
For not shall your morals dissolve in pity

Righteous warmth accompanied
By deceitful tongues
Stay away from processed promises
Let them fear what you know
A malicious smile on their lips
To keep us all under control
Now it's time to rise and demand our due
The whores and their illusions left us bitter and cold

Drench them in their own poison, spit back the scorn of their ways
Out win their defect morality, and the words they pray
Consolidate the troops and expose the lies in their eyes
The ones deprived from the ecstasy that binds the neglect

Better lead than being led, earn any victory
For you stand superior above the plague and it's mass
The burden of proof rests on your shoulders

9. Eradication Instincts Defined

As mortal manufactured waste
And part of the commonly infected
You prevent the ones worthy the gift of life
To surface on once a prosperous soil

As superficially bewildered whores
And succumbing to fictional truth
You are taught to preserve and profit
The life institutional lie

You worthless piece of shit
May we all depart from this world
And dissolve into nothingness
Compassion will not be granted
When life's value
Is point below zero

Human depravity is at our disposal
As the perfect tool to destroy mankind
The worst kind of them all
Modern times' ignorance, the world disease
Appeal to death of every man

A living hate smoldering abyss
Nurtured through centuries with quietly exercised wrath
Seeks the easiest way to the feed the engine
Praising the final bloodbath

Uncertainty and guilt
Will no longer endorse our fate
There will be no remorse, we kill to kill again
Killing all

Go ahead end it all, we deserve no better
As a forever unblessed detonation
The great plutonium chord fulminates
Blinding the eyes of creation

Cutting off all life support
Sweeping away existence instantly
Iced desolate ruins linger
Leaving traces of our lovely humanity

10. Unorthodox Manifesto

The memories far beyond the reckoning
Have begun to lurk in the distance
Like visual objects dearly known
The grace of devils hands

As they walk with me like a medium
When I choose and require a burn-out
Resting in expanded malicious force
Drained for murderous weapons

Knowing where you stand
In the magnitude of this thought
Looking at the spirit of fire and flames
Enduring on the throne of the black heart

A bringer of evil I am
And therefore also a carrier of light
As I use this focus through the dark
And face the sunshine in the dead end

Limitations do not exist
When you are ahead of the crowd
With the art of confidence
I reign at the throne of my soul

The value of this darkness unwinds
Travelling the other path
A hidden triumph
But obvious to the strong and wise

By understanding this reality
I remain in a twice-coloured cloud
With feet connected solid in the ground
And thus I get peace of mind

A bringer of evil I am
And also a carrier of light
As I use this focus through the dark
And face the sunshine in the dead end

11. Heavenly Perverse

Devoted to your own opiate
In escapades from discontentment
Are you shutting off from the outside world
To reflect on your mind shallow gutter?

For this is your empire, this is your intrigue
Here you own them all, here you seal the deed

Contaminated from the spree of self salvation
To keep the fever flowing in the veins
Prominently manipulating heaven and hell
Does your sophistically discreet interlude
Maintain stories not to be revealed?

In your search for redemption
Greed and lies become the savior
Through the lecherous eyes disgust withstand
For are not these the windows to your soul?

Fatherly fornication of sweat lips in dismay
Repeatedly unlocking the vaults to the holocaust
The dormant prodigy seeks it's reason for rebirth
But it will never, never gain the strength

A surrender in superficial scorn
The rape of an ever unborn
Seeds have been planted in the name of the son
Until this day, ungodliness is yet to be gone

Sacramental suicide amidst the flow of virgin vine
The only way to comfort the defeat

Regrets can no longer find it's ways
Streams of innocent bitter tears flowing down the drain
Mirrored in the haze of a partaker's eyes

1. The Serpentine Offering

My descent is the story of everyman
I am hatred, darkness and despair
My descent is the story of everyman
I am hatred, darkness and despair

Evoked and entertained through centuries
Wrathful and sullen -- Dormant still

The ferocity pervades everywhere
Waiting to be released at last
Hear my offering
Ye bastard sons and daughters
Share my sacrifice
Share my sacrifice.

My descent is the story of everyman
I am hatred, darkness and despair

Reconcile not with the fear of the snake
But embrace it as your own
Inject its venom into your veins
And replant the seed that gives growth
Still shrouded in mystery
Until you arise above perception
A veil of ignorance is in motion
Continuing throughout generations

(A veil of ignorance is in motion
Continuing throughout multiple generations
Let me be the one that deliver you from the deceit
And back into perfect accordance with the laws of nature)

The snake is notoriously tempting
But the snake is fair
What is worse than not knowing?
To live or disappear?

The ferocity pervades everywhere
Waiting to be released at last
Hear my offering
Ye bastard sons and daughters
Share my sacrifice
Share my sacrifice

2. The Chosen Legacy

Hence I will anoint
And whisper wholeheartedly
The creed of Hades and beyond
As I succumb to inevitable sin

For I cannot enslave myself
With imaginary words of salvation
The hypocrisy that surrounds my temple
Is assisted by pretenders to the throne

The winds that blow purity
Signify my chosen legacy
I was born to opposition
A contender to creation

In Sorte Diaboli
In Sorte Diaboli
In Sorte Diaboli
In Sorte Diaboli

For my sins
I will ask no forgiveness
For my sins
They are not to forgive

So never speak of me quietly
Stand by my confession
I voice your rebellion
Against the traitor of the world

I am the first creature of this Kingdom
I will be the One
To out live His time
With the triumph of free will

3. The Conspiracy Unfolds

Fallen I have, Fallen I am
Cursed and destined to burn
Fallen I have, Fallen I am
Cursed and destined to burn

My loyalty towards a liar ceased to exist
Once misled by an empty fraudulent face
I will never turn my back on you
And deceive the flesh of our race

I will always speak truly
So you can understand
No riddles that manipulate
The words and symbols of man

Do not believe false promises
Conspiring to cover up the truth
Find solace in darkness within yourself
And have your legions unleashed

Do not withhold the air
Of your very last breath
In the end of days
You will transcend life and death

Let the one who is fit
Be the King
Of the Heavens above
And all worlds down below


4. The Ancestral Fever

From who or what have I
Received this gift?
For what purpose do I
Seduce this craft?

I know these answers
Lie hidden beyond
The powers that be
The power that is me

I will continue to decipher
And make it easier for you
Behold! Let it be told

Try and understand
That all and everything
Which I have done
I have done for you

I will continue to decipher
And make it easier for you
Behold! Let it be told
What is fiction and untrue

I will not leave you behind
With the burdens of belief
And divine misery
That means restless grief

For it is written
The times of old will come anew
And have the universe reversed to its origin
When the ancient winds blew

5. The Sacrilegious Scorn

Have I not
Been too long in the shadows of invention and creation
As I rightfully behold the flesh
Fear of the conscious mind will have you facing away

My word and world holds ground and is real
Your word is like floods of poisoned water
A language spoken with spit from different tongues

It all seems like an eternity
This battle between us two
"Good and evil"
Me and you

Time has come to step up
And take back what you took from me

My word and world holds ground and is real
Your word is like floods of poisoned water
A language spoken with spit from different tongues
You can never corrupt me again

Time has come to step up
And take back what you took from me
You can never corrupt me again

I protect every man guilty of sin
The ultimate sin being me
The vapor from the plague
That infested my mind, body and soul
Obscured my view from wisdom
The mist that had me wonder in resentment cleared
And troubles me no more

7. The Heretic Hammer

Vengeance is mine
Neither sweet nor kind
Vengeance is mine

No longer am I held responsible
For the error of your ways

My conscience
Stand defiantly proud and rigid
So take my advice

Meet your opposition
Profane and disciplined
Take back your pride
With a pounding hammer

No longer am I held responsible
For the error of your ways

My conscience
Stand defiantly proud and rigid
So take my advice

As long as my icon has flesh
No one puts me to the test
And as long as my spirit permits
There will be no fucking rest

Vengeance is mine
Neither sweet nor kind
Vengeance is mine
Vengeance is mine

I owe you nothing
But scorn and contempt
From all that is holy
I will have my revenge

Vengeance is mine
No longer am I held responsible
For the error of your ways

My conscience
Stand defiantly proud and rigid
So take my advice

As long as my icon has flesh
No one puts me to the test
And as long as my spirit permits
There will be no fucking rest

With wisdom and fate
I design darkness
You keep feeding me denial and hate
And from that I will create

Arrogance and deception
Torment and bliss
How I envy your lack justification
When mine is so sincered

8. The Sinister Awakening

I sense the darkness
The desire overtakes
My devotion endeavors
Habitation changing course

Repentance oh not
No name or remorse
Will I ever authorize
On this treasured path

I am warm by this fire
And its flaming desire
For what I can not fulfill
My destiny completes

I believe my truth to be
A much greater thing
Than a manufactured lie
Too great to comprehend

Where I come from
There's no higher authority but me
Being my own god
Is all I was meant to be

Antichristus Spiritualis
Antichristus Spiritualis
Antichristus Spiritualis
Antichristus Spiritualis

In Sorte Diaboli

9. The Fundamental Alienation

My eyes got blinded
And conned by the light
Like a fugitive on the run
I sought perseverance in the night

Deceptive icons were finally
Taken out of my sight
As the contender to origin
I will forever unveil His might

They say I am the cancer
On the back of the Inquisition
I may well be the cancer
In the heart of the Inquisition

They say I am the cancer
On the back of the Inquisition
I am the cancer
In the heart of the Inquisition

Through my years of sacrifice
Evolution came with lessons learned
Respect and fear
Is what I earned
So underestimate not your vision
Or you will be taught
Calculate your intuition
And you will teach

You all have been conned
And I always take the blame
For you do not understand
You are all the same

10. The Invaluable Darkness

Fear Tomorrow's Adversary
And the wealth of uprising
The final storm will be released
And the unmerciful will erect

Hidden from the eyes of your God
I will proclaim original sin
And have you all purged and purified
From the lies that remain within

Cleansed and draped in sulphur linen
Black and pure since the Beginning

Mercy is not truth
Your sins are next to mine
Mercy is not truth
All your sins are next to mine

My soul's ablaze
Inflamed with rage and isolated
In whirlwinds of hate
My soul's ablaze
Yet camouflaged in the haze

Why did He not see this coming
What did He not understand
One time forsaken
But forgotten I am not

I will win this war
But never the peace
I am my own free spirit
Hence I will not rest

11. The Foreshadowing Furnace

Sparks fly and fire licks my wings
Tied to this wood - I was born for burning
I rebelled against the flock
Declined to submit to slavery
As a token from my legions of the chosen few
I reveal the secrets to the world's most famous forgery

As flames devour my skin
Flesh melting - peeling off
My days as an earthbound entity
Are outnumbered and have come to an end

I will never be laid to rest
But be free from oppression

Those of my kin - the black flame
Those of my sin - hail my name
Those of us that have been given eyes to see
Will never be laid to rest but be free from oppression

In this hour I finally separate
Carnal knowledge from divine will
In this hour I finally separate
Myself from your tyranny

Still our enemies will keep hiding
In the shadows with betrayal against reason

But with my reprisal I shall endure
And uncover the magnitude of this treason

I will arise from perdition
And let me presence known
I will author a new era
And have my Beast shown
My stigma is of damnation
I am from beyond your God

2. Born Treacherous

With defiance and resistance
I burn the bridges and their names
Will I ever comprehend
My own spells and games?

Let me keep my world
Let me have my slaves
They all do wonders for me
So I can leave things be
Let me keep my world
As I'm too blind to see

When I lay in bed at night - Wishing well
When I pray for recovery - Feeling hell
Suffocating in my own filth
With no fresh air to inhale

Born treacherous!

Insanity keeps me away and free
From the core of responsibility
But once the pace quickens
I'll be derived from myself
In total mind captivity

3. Gateways

The core principle of freedom
Is the only notion to obey
The formulae of evolution and sin
Leading the way

The rebirth is near completion
As we slowly awaken from slumber

The malpractice of the spirit ends
Gateways!
When the gift is once again attained
Gateways!
No rules or restraints are longer valid
Gateways!
When the ancient future is reclaimed
Gateways!

No rules or restraints are longer valid
Gateways
When the ancient future is reclaimed
Gateways

It is all there for the eyes that can see
The blind ones will always suffer in secrecy
For it is the omen of what lies submerged - Breeding
Untouched within us - Bleeding

The core principle of freedom
Is the only notion to obey
The formulae of evolution and sin
Leading the way

The rebirth is near completion
As we slowly awaken from slumber
To receive the light that shines in darkness
The light that shines forevermore (forevermore)

Be the broken or the breaker
Be the giver or the undertaker
Unlock and open the doors
Be the healer or the faker
The keys are in your hands
Realize you are your own sole creator
Of your own master plan

Be the broken or the breaker
Be the giver or the undertaker
Unlock and open the doors
Be the healer or the faker
The keys are in your hands
Realize you are your own sole creator
Of your own master plan

4. Chess With The Abyss

Old dreams return
Disillusioned I yearn
Am I buried beneath sand and clay?
The caress of cold soil
With limbs crippled to the coil
Locked inside a nightmare womb

Tarnished and grief stricken
Emptiness within a void
Longing for the sun to shine
To discourage the demonoid

Salvation!
Darkness reborn!

We seem to keep fading away
Holding on to that last final sway
A doctrine of self salvation
Darkness reborn on resurrection day?

Stagnating in dead waters
While circling above the surface
Of the deep pale desert sea
Cutting that other life of lines

Salvation!
Wish we'd never met
Salvation!
And rather gone our separate ways
Salvation!
All times spent together
Salvation!
Are the darkest of days
Salvation!
Darkness reborn!

5. Dimmu Borgir

Forces of the northern light - Assemble
Forces of the northern night - Call to arms
Summoned by the secrets of sacrifice

Meeting destiny on the road we took to avoid it
As we only compete with ourselves
Left is that of a confident union

What bridge to cross and what bridge to burn
Deceit is everywhere you turn
We weed out the weak and their weep

Evolving - Compulsively
Behaving - Inconsistently
Yet the pulse is pounding
Restoration is the name
For those who are left in the game
Invocation in the name of our flame

Dimmu Borgir!
The deviants seek but one place
Dimmu Borgir!
Forward onward march!

Forgive we shall not
Forget we shall not
With trickery and treat
Enemies will face defeat

No place for dreamers
As our formation is lava
Fire is with or against you
And so it burns

Constant retribution calling
From the shadows of three consecutive sixes
Merging with the cold dark vacuum
Talent is worthless unless exercised

"When the world is turning
You'll find your true nature
When the first is last and the last is first
You'll be where you choose to be"

Forgive we shall not
Forget we shall not
Fire is with or against you
And so it burns

6. Ritualist

Shedding the old skin
Procreating new sin
Incubation and isolation
A new storm is brewing

Ritualist!
Shedding the old skin
Ritualist!
Procreating new sin
Ritualist!
Incubation and isolation
Ritualist!
A new storm is brewing

Away with obstacles to progress
Those deficient in ambition to prosperity
Yearning but what already is gone
The remains digress
And start anew

Ritualist!
Aligned with the continuum
Ritualist!
Expanding the source at hand

Aligned with the continuum
Expanding the source at hand
Altering the past and the present
The future changes the chain of command

Transfusion of new blood
Congregation of the true blood
With no chains attached
We're letting the past rest
And things will never quite be the same

Transfusion of new blood
Mobilization of true blood
What' s leaving is already left behind
What's leaving is already left behind

With no chains attached
We're letting the past rest
Things will never quite be the same
When we are in charge of the game

Dispatching the chained ones
While being watched by the eyes of time
Everything is clearer now
The search is on for the next horizon

Ritualist!
Moving forward with silence and rapid pace
Ritualist!
Since the horror dawned upon our immediate race
Ritualist!
The veil has once again been extracted
Ritualist!
From the mist that dimmed our eyes

7. The Demiurge Molecule

Synthetic residue touched upon
Scars and wounds frown upon
While other wounds are closing
Stars and losers reassemble
Within thy own abyss

Sought through internal pyre and wind
Not ready to remember where to begin
For another day is yet to come
Before the night takes us home
What will remain
What will leave trace
While travelling through
Time and space

Arcane perfection
Arcane illumination

Arcane perfection
Sweeps away darkness of the old ways
Arcane illumination
Welcomes the birth of another

Haunting visions dawn upon me
While time is standing still
Lost far beyond the imaginary
Out of reach for the soul

8. A Jewel Traced Through Coal

Through moors and mists of deception
The uninitiated are conjoined
Illusive bliss feeds obsession
A feeble orientation is provoked

Inflammatory bonds will be broken
Being the shepherd no more
Yearning for that ever glowing token
In ongoing lore

Images appear before my eyes
At any given time
Burdened bearing all their lies
Leaping laughter and secret smiles

Inflammatory bonds will be broken
Being the shepherd no more
Yearning for that ever glowing token
In ongoing lore

The treasure lies not in regression
But in reaching the levels of becoming
That harboured within us for centuries
Centuries of long lost knowing

Spirit and matter defined
Spirit and matter refined

The upper planes accessed
Insight and co-alliance addressed
Spirit and matter defined
Spirit and matter refined

9. Renewal

Dare not to inflict upon my wishes
Dare not to obstruct upon my path
Dare not to pretend to lick my wounds
When all it means is opening another

Purity comes with rebirth
Reassigned through the slit
Spawned out of the shadows
The light is once again lit

False regrets
Deepest of despair
False visions
Reservoir of grief
False regrets
Whatever presence
False visions
That graced my spirit

Whiffs of clarity
And universal understanding
Come and go

I'm too young and too old
To continue this worthless fight
I've seen through the darkness
To understand the value of light

Though I seek validity
From the Ides of March
I watch the darkness
Open its jaws
Whatever presence
That graced my spirit
Is for whomever
I choose to inherit

10. Endings And Continuations

Ages of the past
Abrahadabra!
Forever to last

Enter the supreme unknown

From within the chambers
Comes expansion of thy own free will
From the outer rooms
Comes extensions of thy own free will

Through the confines of tomorrow
We reappear still
Timeless and elemental

From the ancient future
Comes the seamless and the endless
Ages of the past
Energies eternal
Forever to last

Seeing - Evolving
Willing - Achieving
Beyond the next worlds

Flee the cage of insecurity
Enter the supreme unknown
Expand the inn er and outer horizon
For it is as obvious as it is shown

12. Perfect Strangers

Can you remember remember my name
As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown
And cold spirits of ice
All my life
I am the echo of your past

I am returning the echo of a point in time
Distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known
And laughing as the spirits appear
All your life
Shadows of another day

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain

Perfect Strangers

I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow

A strand of silver hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see
The voice of ages in your mind
Is aching with the dead of the night
Precious life (your tears are lost in falling rain)

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect Strangers
I know I must remain
1. The Unveiling

Become through earned
And granted liberation
Rise above the secrecy
And silent deception

Clarity is determined
At the depths of murky waters
The potion of black earthed blood
Is the sludge draining the conscious

Essential learning
Corrupted and drifted
In this deceiving world
The modern savant has ignored the soul

Expose the dreamworld
We all believe to be real
Forgotten, forbidden
All the knowledge that is hidden

In the shadows
Our eyes are blind with confusion
The curtains hide the present
Leaving only rays of disillusion

Expose the dreamworld
We all believe to be real
Forgotten, forbidden
All the knowledge that is hidden

2. Interdimensional Summit

Mired in illusion
Lost in the masters game
Silenced by the idea of time
Nurtured with lies and deceit

The silent seeker, the seer
Travels beyond the veil
The silent seeker, the seer
Fleeing the dense womb of ignorance

To the trained eye
There are no coincidences
The more you see
The less it makes sense
To the trained eye
There are no coincidences
If you can not see
You can not truly know

We are the current sum of all the ages
Leaving a trail of burnt pages
Thrown into darkness as stars
We travel alone as one

When the dust settles on the tavern
Is when we're liberated from illusion
Taking our first and final breath
Realizing life is always after death

3. Ætheric

The word that has been spoken
Through time and time again
Is the light that inhabits our voice
The light that keeps us aflame

All retrospection is invalid
As we've been fed disdain
Confined to the fence of knowledge
We need to die, die again

To govern thyself
You must know your darkness
To govern thyself
You must know your past

All rise and fall
All is internal
All eternal
All rise and fall

Controlling matter with will
We withstand every storm
In and out of exile
Spirit, matter and form

To govern thyself
You must know your darkness
To govern thyself
You must know your past

4. Council Of Wolves And Snakes

Nomads plunging into the vast abyss
Unattached, fleeting through the chasm
Naked in pure darkness
Embracing the new dawn

We are gods here for the taking
Yield to the dragon's embrace
We are gods
Yield to the dragon's embrace

As pawns in this secret game
No one knows nothing
Yet, in the realm of sacred play
Everyone knows everything

A winged and secret flame
Leaving this paradigm
A dimension we are set to flee

We are gods in the making
We are here for the taking
Yield to the dragon's embrace
We are of transcendence
We are wolves and snakes

A winged and secret flame
Leaving this paradigm
A dimension we are set to flee
The arrival is in the departure
We are sculpted into life
By the hands of death

5. The Empyrean Phoenix

Legionnaires of degradation
Ridden with disease
Disguised as martyrs
Preaching counterfeit peace

Unbound, glory forever untouched
Unbound, from its inception
To its final round

Through the tunnels
Darkness dims the vision
Yet, the light is kept guarded
Secretly

Unbound, glory forever untouched
Unbound, from its inception
To its final round

Risen anew from its humiliation
The fire has been awoken

The crossroads many
The highways few
Through desert storms it flew
The spirit of the phoenix wins
Restored anew

Unbound, glory forever untouched
Unbound, from its inception
To its last final round

6. Lightbringer

Discover with courage
While facing the beyond
Uncompromisingly
Everything connects
As you detach

Truth foretold
Truth discovered
Truth always known

All growth comes at a cost
Moving forward means sacrifice
Enduring all paths crossed

Lucifer Lux Lucifer

The shadow is your dragon
Making the darkness conscious
Your wings open wide
Old souls becoming of age

Prosperity comes with a price
All growth comes at a cost
Moving forward means sacrifice
Enduring all paths crossed

Truth foretold
Truth discovered
Truth always known

The secrets of existence
Everything's within reach
The beginning is near
The end never draws fear

Lucifer Lux Lucifer

7. I Am Sovereign

Undo me
And feel no restraint
Undo me
Pain is wanting closure
Undo me
The mind it needs to rest
Undo me
I shall be restored

Perseverance doesn't mean anything
Unless it's for eternity
The real powers that will ever be
Is freedom and liberty

Undo me
And feel no restraint
Undo me
Pain is wanting closure
Undo me
The mind it needs to rest
Undo me
I shall be restored

A lifetime worthy of awakening
Is a life worth transcending

We learn as we teach
We teach as we speak
We speak as we seek
We seek what we learn

Knowing when to end a journey
Is to recognize where it begins
What we really seek is not here
But on the other side of fear

We learn as we teach
We teach as we speak
We speak as we seek
We seek what we learn

8. Archaic Correspondence

Dead at nothing
Alive at everything
You travel time
And time travels you
As within so without
As above so below

When we set sail
Energy is our procession
The journey inward repeats
The horizon is our destination

Life is the trial
And the passage is death
Storming through oblivion
Life is a trial
And the passage is death
Storming through the veil

The transition from internal life
Repressed and unseen
Forgotten
Lurking in the shadow of your mind
Losing yourself is the key
To leave everything behind
Losing yourself is the key
The shadows become our past

The migration of the soul
Picks up where it leaves the flesh
And enters the finish line
Sustained through another time

Life is the trial
And the passage is death
Storming through oblivion
Life is a trial
And the passage is death
Storming through the veil

As within so without
As above so below

9. Alpha Aeon Omega

The inevitable exchange
Is when knowledge comes
Without judgement

The final transition
Is when knowledge becomes
The internal

The facilitators of darkness
Are the true providers
To the world's light

Ascending the highest mountain
Beyond the perception of reality
Forever free
From illusion of mortality

Open are all the doors
All will run its course
Leaving the former paradigm
Escalating, further the climb

Ascending the highest mountain
Beyond the perception of reality
Forever free
From illusion of mortality

The flow is ever present
Upstream and against the current
Ascending the highest of mountains
Free

1. Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel

I saw the virgin's cunt spawning forth the snake
I witnessed tribes ov Judah reduced to ruin
I watched disciples twelve dissolved by flame
Looked down on son ov god snuffed in vain

Blow your trumpets Gabriel!
As I beheld the bewilderment ov Eden
Break the bread...and crumb by crumb into the Leviathan's den...
Nations fall prey
Hail my return

Hosanna Hosanna
Tribe ov Judah decimate
Hosanna Hosanna
Root ov David eradicate

Hosanna Hosanna
Let wine ov Sodom fill our mouths
Hosanna Hosanna
May Sin ov Gommorah grace our hearts


2. Furor Divinus

Veto! I vomited forth
From a throat choked by rope
As lunatic mob
Shackled maimed feet
Tore asunder both wings

Pluck my eyes out
Rip my tongue
Make me slave to gravity

Bleed dry ov tears
Weep with blood
Leave to atrophy

I sought reprisal high and low
I spew forth plagues to taint their soil
I crept under the shadow ov purity
In my hour ov pious wane
I turned to boundless catechism
Behold the anathema ov benediction
Sacrilege in Gethsemane manifest
Furor Divinus
Anointed sin became flesh

Emerge The accuser ov all
Hark the universe cries forlorn
Bleeds from black lungs ov hell
Deflowered by the horns

And so I reversed the wheel ov my fortune
Strike blind the eye ov the lion
With every breath stolen from their lips
I raped and raped and raped the daughters ov Zion

Raise the dagger Abraham
And slit the throat ov thy only son
Reverse the history ov man
Fuck and reset the world

Pluck my eyes out
Rip my tongue
Make me slave to gravity

Bleed dry ov tears
weep with blood
Leave my cross to atrophy


3. Messe Noire

I believe in Satan
Who rend both heavens and earth
And in the Antichrist
His dearly misbegotten
The anguish ov our future
A Bastard spawned from lie
Born ov a harlot nun
Reign high in luxury
Aloft the kings ov man

I use words sharp as a sword
To rake Saints ’shins bestrewn
Three days risen – the grand deceiver
I bless the world with ire and woe

So, can you hoard host like Zion’s coin
Belie progeny ov your pain?
IHWH, thou sayeth unto me:
Thou, disrupter, imbalance my creations!
Hence I transfix in bliss ov flagellation
I burnt in rapture, wafted ash about…
Became the law above all laws
In asymmetry ov the horns

I cut loose the cord ov li(f)e
Depart celestial source
Rub mould in holy pages
Let woodworms eat the cross
I prayed I’d die in you O Lord
I pray you’d die in me…

Who shall crucify the last prophets
And have them wilt on splintered stems?
Who shall churn hells across the earth
And reascend to seat himself…
At the left hand ov Satan
Be gaoler ov the living
…And ov the dead
As it was in the beginning
Now and shall ever be
…World without end
Amen


4. Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer

Voice ov an aeon,
Angelus Satani.
Ora pro nobis Lucifer,
You alone have suffered.

The fall and torment ov shame,
I'll smite Heaven's golden pride,
And never pity thee,
Immaculate divine.

Satan ov Elohim,
None dare to stand in your way.
Thou bow to none,
Ov Eden's feculence.

Conjure the serpent messenger,
Saviour (order in) world's decay.
Concord in temptation,
And in the fall of Eve.

For thine is the kingdom,
And the power.

For thine is the kingdom,
And the glory,
Forever.

Scholar ov the unlight,
Great volcano ov excrement,
Rippling eager to erupt,
Reconstellate the firmament.

Behold the great accuser,
A megalinga of throbbing zeal,
Raptor yearning to pierce,
To rape the seventh seal.

Destroyer ov cosmos,
Implore the ungod,
Implode the sun,
There is none wronging the serpent's cult.

Untouched and ignored,
With the serpent's might,
And the trumpets blow,
In the shadow ov the horns.

For thine is the kingdom,
And the power.

For thine is the kingdom,
And the glory,
Forever.

Lightning that stabs the heavens,
Thou quiver the mount Sinai,
Split rocks on tablets ov covenant
Listen for the tempest's rasp.

Azazel! Apolyon!
The black sun never sets,
For it never rose.

Habemus Satanas,
The Caesar's wrath.
Empire's fall,
Petition the lord with fire,
Santa Sede burns.

Phallus Dei,
Erect from pole to pole,
Viva blasfemia,
In coitus infinitus.

Hear the universe scream,
Bleeding from black holes,
Whom horns caress,
And whom God mourns.


5. Amen

Hail Mary, full ov disgrace
The Lord has fornicated with thee
Cursed art thou among men
And possessed

Cunning as shroud ov Turin
On the autopsy ov god
Damnata Virgo Maria
Credo undone

Bitch ov a sybilline vulva
Usurpress and liar
Witch of broken vows
Centuries wept because ov thee…
Where art thou now in the hour ov trial?!?

Cunning as shroud ov Turin
On the autopsy ov god
Creatio ex nihilo
Credo undone

Wretched is the fruit ov thy womb, Babylon!
Holy mother, mother ov god
Pray for us not, the sinners
Now and at the hour ov our death
Amen


6. The Satanist

I descended from the Mount Sinai
Unleashed the splendour upon a scroundel mob
To shelter where no messianic light
Drove one single ray into the pulp ov life
O sweet Salome I beckon thee
Bring forth thy heinous offering
Without your love
So incomplete
Corrupt me with your dignity

I decompose in rapture ov hells
Dissolve divide disintegrate
I am yours
In euphoria below

At faintest whim they would impale the sun
And thus the sheep in me became the wolf in man
I am the fly that flew forth from the ark
My thoughts like insects
Whoring wounds divine
Been bored with cosmos my dear old foe
This universe has never been enough
Compelled to liberate the spring ov life
When the levee breaks gush forth o’ stream ov ice

I decompose in rapture ov hells
Dissolve divide disintegrate
I am yours
In euphoria below

I cast my halo from perdition’s clay
Behold my bliss profane
Born ov a lie
Condemned to lurk
Live in denial
Yet coiled aflame…

I am the great rebellion
Neath Milton’s tomb I dwell
An existence even sin would not pardon
No guilt, no reason, saviour, or shame


7. Ben Sahar

Thee I cast aside
Fetus divine
Agnus dei
Free ov thy lies

Hearken hosts on high
Fetch me your god
As my ambition prescribes
Challenge the sun
Ascend shall I unto the heavens
Exalt my throne above his celestial display
Sit shall I upon that mount ov congregation
Far toward the north

Hearken dogs ov Nazarene
Linger at St. Peter’s door
Partake from the well ov nothingness
Bite the withered hand ov god
Ascend shall I unto the heavens
Exalt my throne above his celestial display
Sit shall I upon that mount ov congregation
Far toward the north

Boreal hell beneath my feet
Blistering Eden above
With prayer on lips
With freedom bequeathed
Thru fire we walk
With fire in hearts!


8. In The Absence Ov Light

Every seme the Devil breathes
My steps never outweighed the gravity ov hell
So I keep praying for rain ov flaming rocks
To foster the symmetry ov worlds

I had a vision ov the impenetrable darkness
Never found on neither side ov the moon
It wields composure ov my soul
That comes as one with the odium below

Chant the psalm
Non serviam
Retrieve the pride
Within and without

"I reject each order, each idea.
I trust no abstraction, no doctrine.
I believe not in god nor mind…
enough with these gods.
Give me a human.
Let him be just like me, just like me…
Dull, unripe, unfinished, dark, and not bright.
So that I may dance with him, play with him, fight with him
pretend in front of him,
tempt him and rape him...
love him, recreate myself through him,
grow with him, and sprouting this way,
wed myself, in the church ov man"

I imagined the most ardent ray ov sun
Like vulture hovering above my neck
It burns with fever deep within my soul
Erect in glory to sink into shame

Oh lord, whence came this doubt?
Thou doth know I am all and everything
Let loose my shackles
Let chaos reign
Infecting moral arteries...

Chant the psalm
Non serviam
Retrieve the pride
Within and without


9. O Father O Satan O Sun!

Akephalos
Shine thru me
Come forth in war
Come forth in peace

Bring down the sun
Extinguish all the stars
Let me remain
In splendor ov thy light

Bornless One
As darkness bright
Found not in tongues
Found not in light

Bring down the rain
Drain waters ov Styx
Faustian luminary
Redeem
Blaspheme

Like a day without the dawn
Like a ray void ov the sun
Like a storm that brings no calm
I'm most complete yet so undone

Agathos Daimon
Ov plague and fever
Thy name is nowhere
Thy name is never

Liberate me
Ignite the seeds
Bind not to guilt
Ignis Gehennalis

O Father
O Satan
O Sun
Let the children come to thee
Behold the morning star

Akephalos
Shine thru me
Come forth in war
Come forth in peace

Like a day without the dawn
Like a ray void ov the sun
Like a storm that brings no calm
I'm most complete yet so undone

O Lion-Serpent Sun, The beast that whirlest forth,
a thunder-bolt, begetter of life!
Thou that flowest! Thou that goest!
Thou Satan-Sun, Hadith, that goest without will!
Thou Air! Breath! Spirit! Thou without bound or bond!
Thou essence, air swift-streaming, elasticity!
Thou wanderer, father of all!
Thou wanderer, spirit of all!

Hear me, and make all spirits subjects unto me;
so that every spirit of the firmament and of the ether,
upon the earth and under the earth,
on dry land and in the water
of whirling air, and of rushing fire,
and every spell and scourge of god
may be obedient unto me.

Thou spiritual sun! Satan, thou eye, thou lust!
Cry aloud! Cry aloud!
Whirl the wheel, O my Father, O Satan, O Sun!

2. Moonspell Rites

From the dark ancient temples
Horrible palaces
From the land of dark forests
Kingdom of snow and frost
Where true evil dwells
Where flames are spiritual food
Where black satanic holocaust strikes
And people are baptized in blood
I come with the northern winds
I remain true, closed in icy heart

Cold, I'm standing in the moonlight
Demons return to me every night
Fill my soul with sacred power
Mystical whispers resound with hallow echo
Spread out my hands
Cold north majesty rises
Unsilent winds strike this pagan landscape
Where gods sit high on the oaken thrones

I'm the dark warrior, presented in flames
Carried on the hellish wings of fire
I discover the deepest desires, feel delight
I destroy all the god's laws
I am almighty immortal power


3. Towards The Dying Sun We March

From the blood of the earth
From its sacred soil
That alters a spell
Contorting with the stars of revenge
Come forth, martyrs of the underworld!

Blessed, but thou are not!
Cruel godhead, thy child, and in the world for so long
Its expression I draw out and march towards the sun
Unleashing force
Can't stop me now!

Born of the seas
The setting tides confine reality
Between future ov the living, perdition I dwell
Anointed by blissful hypocria that never ends!

In unyielding expression of selflessness
Where I dare to challenge thy gravity
Thus, speaks the nature of my ways
Thus, the true light illuminates!

Here lie limitless sins ov eminence
Where valiant boats implode, drifts the world netherwards
Standing with face of hell, lest we flog what's crucified
I shall layeth with my soul to rest, until I reach the sun's might!

Elohim! - I shall not forgive!
Adonai!...


2. Wolves ov Siberia

Enthrone thyself, O Archuman
O how thou shineth in the realm above
As planets rumble when thou descended upon this globe
To walk this Earth like a shimmering god

Let it be forever heard
We lost our Eden to own the world
Let it be forever know
We lost our battle to win the war

Come all ye, Wolves ov Siberia
We hail the flame, we hail the ice
Beyond bosom, beyond materia
We reject! We fucking deny!

Let it be forever heard
From Slave to king, from king to man
Let it be eternally know
We fled from heavens to rape the world

3. God = Dog

There's serpent coiling around my neck
The adoring crescent moon in blazing night
The holy river Ganga flowing through my muddled hair
In the ancient times before I learned ov who I am

If I am a missing link between the pig and the divine
I shall cast the pearls before the swine

I am no good shepherd on an ox
But a solitude ov the loneliest star
Like a 1000 shrines subsumed into the void
Like a dead space in between the suns

Is a God to live in a dog? No!
But the highest are of us
Is a God to live in a dog? No!
But the highest are of us

Elohim
I shall not forgive!
Adonai
I shall not forgive!
Living God
I shall not the forgive!
Jesus Christ
I forgive thee not!


4. Ecclesia Diabolica Catholica

Eritis sicut dii
Thus sermonized the serpent ov Eden
Thus struck the breath ov the Earth
And thus flooded the blood ov the soil
Slither into the gaping void!

I worship Thee, O vicious man!
Now mark my words ye mortal race
Feed my wrath with lion's gore
Feed my envy with the fat ov lambs
As the wicked ways will flourish
Behold the monuments ov God decay

Lex Divinus, I stamp to dust
I despoil the holy books
I desecrate the angelic verses
Like dead leaves wither they to ash
As I am leading the hosts ov stars
Onwards, embrace the Sur

In absentia Dei we sermonize
In ecclesia Satani
Thy might is right!

I have watched the birth ov planets
I have witnessed the death ov worlds
I've conducted the choir ov stars
I have ridden the tail ov the comet
As I've transformed
From God to ash
From dust to Man

In absentia Dei we evangelize
In absentia Christi
We spread like swarming plagues
In ecclesia Satani
Thy might is right!


5. Bartzabel

O Purple flame!
O whirling wheel ov life!
Appear! Move! Rise!

Come unto me Bartzabel
By the laws divine I quell
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the raging blood cells
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the spear, the sword, the spell
Come unto me Bartzabel

Come unto me Bartzabel
By the circling citadel
Come unto me Bartzabel
By this mind ov miracles
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the moon and stars, I swear!

By Ra Hoor Khuit!
By Elohim!
By Samael!
By Seraphim!

By Gods ov War!

By Gods ov War!
By Khem and Hoor!
By Hachiman!
Mentu, and all
And by thy master, Graphiel
Come unto me
O Bartzabel!


6. If Crucifixion Was Not Enough...

Crawl with insects and feed on barren soil!
O! rise above the animal in you!
Find kindness among the unkind!
Slowness ov decrepitude
Like sirens beckoning me to their ruined shores!
Impotent in the eye ov the storm!
Cthonic ore forefathers!
Ravishing sires ov the black hosts!

Feast on their bones!
Feed on their flesh!
Ares!
Adonis!
Astarte!
Prometheus' Rebirth!

In constellations with dust!
And thus thou empowered me!
I am legion in company ov seraphs!
At the threshold ov this godless anarchy!
Malediction to all that is Angelic!
Pariah ov collapsing truth!
Crucifixion was not enough!
The alpha ov this mortal whorl!

Feed on their bones!
Feed on their flesh!
Ares!
Adonis!
Astarte!
Asmodias' Rebirth!


7. Angelvs XIII

Begone!

Ye prophets ov Eucharist
My praise shall climb to your decline
May rust corrode on Michael's sword
Recession ov the progeny divine

Come forth ye!
Preachers ov imminent death
Let loose the mighty beasts upon
Damnatio Ad Bestiam!
Bring an end to this decrepit world

Countless my legions
Many my names
A thousand descendants
A goat ov Mendez

Come forth ye!
Heralds ov ruir
And mute to dust their anaemic way's
Futile relic ov an utopian age
King ov kings recrucified
What an ignominious end!

El Shaddai
Woe unto Thee O Galilean God Be Thou ashamed YHWH!
Woe unto Thee To aeons I curse!

Countless my legions
Many my names
A thousand young
A goat ov Mendez

For I am my Christ over myself
The accused became the accuser
For I am Satan incarnate
Serpent ov old immaculate!

8. Sabbath Mater

I am she who spits out the lusts
The root ov sin derived from me
I am born ov sacrilegious uterus
Magna peccatrix
I am she who cast the adversaries out
I am the spawn ov her vulva obsolete
Libera nos blasfemia madonna
Magna hecate

With the sound ov trumpets!
With the pounding ov demon drums!
Come forth within!
Come forth without!

With the roaring thunders
With the blinding light
Come to be exalted!
Come to be despised!

For i am Aurora's son
With no beginnin, with no decline
Sabbath ,atter dolorosa
A progency ov her lecherous cunt
Love me orgasmically
Fuck me estatically
Genetrix meretix
I pledge my heart to thee
I bow down devotedly

With the sound ov trumpets!
With the pounding ov demon drums!
Come forth within!
Come forth without!

With the roaring thunders
With the blinding light
Come to be honoured
And to be despised!

Blessed be the destroyer
For she's the creator!


9. Havohej Pantocrator

Our father, who art in hell
Unhallowed be Thy name
Thy legions come
Thy enemies begone
On Earth as it is in the Netherworld
Embrace our souls untraveled
Let us sail to the farthest sea
Ignite our craving hearts
Illuminate our ageless will

Dissolve!
Coagulate!

Our father, who lies in wait
Unhallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom enshrines
Thy phosphor blinds
On Earth as it is in Hell
Embrace my soul untraveled
Let me sail to the farthest sea
When I am Thou, O Lord
And Lord when Thou art Me

Dissolve!
Coagulate!

By thou holy name: Satan
At his command
Heaven shall burn!
By thou holy name: Lucifer
At his command
Heaven shall blaze!
By thou holy name: Leviathan
At his command
Heaven shall burn!
By thou holy name: Belial
At his command
Heaven shall burn!

10. Rom 5:8

Morning Star
Phosporos
How Thou shinest in the fiery
Empyrean above
Paracletus
How do I rejoice, for Thy apostles flock around

For Thou art Christ a rebours!
L'enfer abides deep within
Limbo is stirring up Thy cells
Below Sheol, where odium dwells
Reverse Davidian psalm
The jaws ov Hades set ajar

Let the cold moon
lick the blood from my stigmatas
Let the burning sun
devour gore from my wounds

For I am Christ a rebours!
L'enfer abides deep within
Limbo is stirring up in my cells
Deep down below my odium dwells
Reverse Davidian psalm
The jaws ov Pandemonium set ajar

"I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore."
"I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore."

11. We Are The Next 1000 Years

Oh sun and moon beheld!
When we rose up from dust
No sound or song would dare dispraise
The might we have become

We hail to Thee, O avenging force!
We are the dawn ov New Jerusalem
We are the ending ov all days
We are the next 1000 years!

To Christ, falls saviour on the cross!
To the Emperor ov Rome!
To Christ, falls saviour on the cross!
To the devil in our souls!

We go where no mortals dare to go
Explore that human flesh yet not explored
The tree ov god shall not withstand the ruthless storm
We are the death that rides the pale horse

We hail to Thee, O avenging force!
We are the deportees from the Promised Land
Fallen, but we rewrite the history with blood
We are the next 1000 years!

To Christ, falls saviour on the cross!
To the Emperor ov Rome!
To Christ, falls saviour on the cross
For devil our souls!

2. Summoning Of The Ancient Gods

mystic voices lead me to suicide
I will unite my flesh with him tonight
blasphemous son in my veins
into the magic circle

lord of dark winds
obscure my soul
burn my eyes
make me see illusions

burning in black flames forever
the child of my morbid perversion
is screaming glory of darkness
sing the occultic psalm

with the book of eternal oath
I created the face of the goat
unholy psalm to lead the souls
blood means the pact with my lord

cold winds of doom prevail
7 horns sing the prophecy
glory to the darkest depth
revelate my eternal prayer


3. Dark Triumph

primeval god finally returns
comes a sound of triumph
I hear his voice
a dawn of evil prayer
a raise of million hands
revelation of our dreams

I open my eyes
I'm into the tomb
feel a touch of cool
carry beneath the gates

...and now lucifer comes
rides on the wings of winds
opens the gates of ancient towns
leads us to eternal delight
among the thousand flames
from dark to black again

his eyes are dark and cold
like northern frost
and icy breath
is a wind for the faithful

bring me there
where daylight never exists
and people live on gloom
bring me there
where I will be free
from god's tyranny


4. Rise Of The Blackstorm Of Evil

my black face in the shadow
of the pentagram
among the silent forests
in the never existing town
my fingers touched the sky
I was god in forgotten times
jesus and his servants were
sucking my feet

...lucifer, give me the power to rise

now I'm fallen
a down of misery
among the blurs of evil
hidden in morality
I had power to destroy god
my demons ruled the crowd
now I can do nothing
alone in black crypt

...satan, give me the power to rise

but there will be days
when I shall rise
a dawn of my kingdom
slowly comes
I will fight again
will take your mind
to sit on the golden throne
somewhere in the sky

...belial, give me the power to rise
...oh... oh... satan, give me the power to rise...

1. Transylvanian Forest

Pure paganism I worship in the woods
Forest's mountains never saw by human eye
Kingdom of the ancient and horned evil
Covered by golden wood and black thorns
My armor like a bark of old oak
I rape my wounds and blood flows down to the ground

Covered by the snow naked crowns of trees
Like crying mothers Slavonic worshippers
Pagan warriors hide in frozen wood
Like black statues born in the heart of winterevil
Ride on the thunders and moonstorms
Where the land is open for full witching moon

Mouth kiss the leaves fallen in the past
Fingers touch the frozen land
Pagan fears fall down on icy skin
Wild eyes filled with dark-red blood
Are staring into depths of virgin forest
Where my grave on unholy land

Covered by the snow...

Winds carry me through Transylvania
Virgin evil hidden in the blackest heart
I joined the ceremony of wolves
Where unsilent gods sit high on their goathrones
Now the majesty is ready for pure holocaust
The feast of Babylon whore and her wolf


2. Moonspell Rites

From the dark ancient temples
Horrible palaces
From the land of dark forests
Kingdom of snow and frost
Where true evil dwells
Where flames are spiritual food
Where black satanic holocaust strikes
And people are baptized in blood
I come with the northern winds
I remain true, closed in icy heart

Fire!

Cold, I'm standing in the moonlight
Demons return to me every night
Fill my soul with sacred power
Mystical whispers resound with hallow echo
Spread out my hands
Cold, north majesty rises
Unsilent winds strike this pagan landscape
Where gods sit high on the oaken thrones

Fire!

I'm the dark warrior, presented in flames
Carried on the hellish wings of fire
I discover the deepest desires, feel delight
I destroy all the god's laws
I am almighty, immortal power

4. Pure Evil And Hate

In the night of full moon sacrifice
We are joining with the sign of drums of war
Freezing moon opens the gates of paradise
Our swords are raised up to the skies

Pure evil and hate!
Sodomy and pain!

Where the holy angel's dwell we'll burn it down
We'll turn on hate god's flower of love
Brain of lust we'll spread everywhere
Our pagan brothers will sodomize Christ's flesh

Pure evil and hate!
Sodomy and pain!

1. From Horned Lands To Lindisfarne

they came from the cold north
carried on the wings of waves
no one knows the cult
bloody acts were only a legend...
eternal hate and horned sodomy
came to the lands of virgin's goodness

moonless night showed me their return
I saw drakkars between the silence, in the dream
when the witches called the spirits from forest
from hornedlands to lindisfarne...

lords of the fjord, turned daylight
into december frost, fathers of ice
proclaimed the new century, marked the paths
which I follow now, enter the forest
like you open your veins
in the night of the pagan union

witches among the night, lead me to the horned moon
I entered my evil soul to fortify my frosty hate
freezing breath of the blackheart fill the interior
pagan wings rise me over the evil palace

massacre will be the beginning of iron holocaust
evil enters the skies for the return of sodomy
black snow covers the horde of christ
winterwinds destroy jehova's palace

ancient spirits proclaimed the return
coldnights await like hungry wolves
the powers join among the mountains
the oaks sing funeral songs of frost
I drink the blood for all pagan souls


2. Thy Winter Kingdom

enslaved in a cloud above the vast sea
I've finished my journey through the 7 incarnations
the blaze of my glory die out for this world
as the blaze of my rustly steel died

dark forests, unknown vast lands
were my home, my dream which came true
wild as eternal fear of the blackness
I live primeval life under the horned one's rules

steeps resounded with the howl of the wolves
searching alone for the victim
and from the deep forest rised you chant
about the god of coldwinds and desire

crushing the last wound of the crucified one
I stalked the path of the sword, fire and blood
my armies of the ships like dragons
spread fear among the holy lands

altars were burning with black fire
for the master of eternal spaces
born for our blood and fiery steel
victorious wave of warfare and mayhem

immortal, invincible, dark warrior
(I) leaded my troops through countless battles
and the scream of the dying was our pride
I split a lot of blood, stole human souls, cruel

now it's time to finish my journey, to rest
I fall into oblivion with weapons
no one will feed my razor with blood again
and the ships sing the psalm of the immortal...


3. Summoning Of The Ancient Gods

mystic voices lead me to suicide
I will unite my flesh with him tonight
blasphemous son in my veins
into the magic circle

lord of dark winds
obscure my soul
burn my eyes
make me see illusions

burning in black flames forever
the child of my morbid perversion
is screaming glory of darkness
sing the occultic psalm

with the book of eternal oath
I created the face of the goat
unholy psalm to lead the souls
blood means the pact with my lord

cold winds of doom prevail
7 horns sing the prophecy
glory to the darkest depth
revelate my eternal prayer


4. The Dance Of The Pagan Slaves

oh, cursed profanated thougths of glory return to me
receive my every fall, my every pain and misfortune
and wrath will born inside you
stronger than sounds of bells
primeval instincts will wake
pagan brothers of our blood
professing to the majesty of horned evil

the war we'll begin
will be the final fall of god's flock
we'll have a bloodbath and covered with gore
we'll praise the name of the highest
what's you fallen god for us
he had leaded people to eternal slavery
his angels falling into night like dead swans
to rise never again

pagan around the wooden symbols
transmitting the power from hands to hands
blood for god of gods, king of kings
unholy master


5. Black Visions Of The Almighty

flames reflects in my eyes
the wildness and hate are born
I draw the magic signs in the air
the pride, act of holy bastards burnt
here's no more place for them
there's no day, only the moon and the night

I turn into ashes all the holyness
I destroy the altars of contempt with my sword
then I hide in a blackrain, naked trees
the depths of the forests are my home
as the wolf I appear this night
as the wild dog I'm howling with lust for blood and hunger

I'm the warrior of the night obsessed by hell
bringing hate, pain and desire
I observe the blackwitches of beauty
protected with the shadow of my sword
they gave me the wisdom, fed with blasphemy
they assist in my every journey, my heart belongs to them

at midnight I call the winds of mayhem
the power of the horned evil protects me
I see how jesus tears mix with angel's blood
in my visions I observe...
how the skies turn to black, with the upcoming fire

I'm playing with the view of this night
I love the gloomy landscapes of my world
obsessed like an animal, old as the planet
I speak words of the ancient knowledge
I give you things, which in paradise
could be only a dream...


6. Fields Of Haar-Meggido

observe the message from the darkside of the moon
spectral warrior all in icy steel
as I proudly touch my cold weapon
the pagan steel sighs with the fullmoon

so the war has just began
enslaved nations of the tombworld
can finally reach their weapons

evil arrives in glory, comes on the four winds
and the masters of hellthrones
ride the darkness on devilwings
forces of the earth unleash the storms

final day is here my children
lambs of christ, my believers
we must destroy the reign of evil

and the holy armies of heaven rode the sky
all the angels saw the abyssic fire
and some of them threw the swords in fear
and fell down into the pit

our mayhemic, bloody steel
with the thunders of the drums
wil crush the weak holyness

the forces gathered down the haar-meggido
spilt with hate all the angels blood
in black chaos hell reigns

so we won together with the evil winds
streams of blood flow through the land
open for the sons of satan


7. Deathcrush

Demonic laughter your cremation
Your lungs gasp for air but are filled with blood
A sudden crack as I crushed your skull

The remind of your life flashes by
A life that soon won't be
Smiling with axe in my hand
Evil's rotten hand you'll see

I come forward
Deathcrush

I'll send you to your maker
I'll send you to your death
Death nicely crucified
Death, heads on stakes

The barbeque has just begun
Deathcrush - Deathcrush - Deathcrush

Crush - Crush
Deathcrush
Deathcrush
Deathcrush

1. Chant Of The Eastern Lands

In the forest of the Eternal dreaming
Old oak lighted up by the fullmoon's light
The coldness of dungeon torches the inside of wooden maze
From the womb of the mother-wolf I was born
The witches foretold the coming of tragedy
They awakened fright in the hearts of my enemies
In the midnight wilderness I took a pledge
Quickly I fell in love with the taste of steel
For ages waiting for its donudation
The final triumph
The pure barbarity
I howl to the moon to support my battle
The moon, symbol of purity, the essence of beauty
I damn the sun, rising again and again
In brightness of bloody light, steel holocaust
I received hails from the northern side
Of snowcovered Carpathians
The light breath of nightbreeze, as a sign
I summon the iron powers, cavalry of my brothers
From the land of armageddish fields
I am bard of the eastern lands...
I lead my brothers for death struggle
In glory of victory my armies rise
Barbarians tribes with fury of desecration
With axes reach the sky, hiding usurpator in their wings
Call the clouds, desecrating all the holiness
Hurt bodies on the snow, Pandaemonium burns
This battle is a rebellion, rebirth of old traditions
Mythical hell is the paradise to the true warriors
There they attain eternity and sit high on the thrones
Pagan nations became united
Mighty bards received their long awaited silence
Slavs returned to their villages and woods
Pagan frights of heavenly hell dispelled
... I opened the door to the higher than stars knowledge
And took a long walk through the unknown dimensions
As the sign of the fullmoon, in damnations I shall rise


2. The Touch Of Nya



3. From The Pagan Vastlands

From the land which hasn't enter yet
Into the history
From the depths of swamps we are bringing
Proudly our name
At night, kissing the moonlight -
- rebel children living in twilight
Like wolves...
... some named us so...
Union with people from the sign
Of the half-moon
To crush the golden walls of
Earthly heaven,
To strangle the pestilence...
To the lands of the mighty Empire
Others even think about with fear
We invaded a state with sword
In our hands
Roma means nothing
In the land of Slavs !
Today forests sing about the legend,
Long forgotten spirits
Whose names nobody remembers now
Waiting their day to reborn
Their visions of the past
Are torturing our souls
Whispering in the dark...
... they will come here again
To reign supreme
Believe my words...
From unremembrance
From Fire and Water
From the sacred woods
Ancient Wolves gather
From the burnt Arkona
... From the Pagan Vastlands !
Black horse rides across the sky
With a sword we will open the amber gates of Nawia
Dzieci Svantevitha nienawidza Chrystusa !!!
Dzieci Svantevitha nienawidza boga-krzyza !!!


4. Hidden In A Fog

Night in the mountains comes with the fly of a raven
Carpathians bathed in the light of the moon
In old ruins where the dying shadows
Are watching the shine from the stars
Nobody remembers days of glory
Several hundreds years passed in silence
Not a soul has been seen here
I am standing on a hill
So silent is the sky
I am drinking in the cold of this night
Old grey wolf lying upon my foots
Is licking the hand of mine
It is night... in my heart
It is moon... in my eyes
I am hidden in a fog - my own breath
Small village in a valley
Sleeping in a fear, in a fear of me !
Loathsome race of the mortals
Magic of wolfish teeth, wings of bats
Faithful guards of religion
Old as the blood itself -
- The Cult of the Undead Vampirism !
Frenzy of lust, frenzy of pain
She was only fourteen
No cry has bursted from her lips
Pity that she had to die
But how sweet was her neck...
It is night... in my heart
It is moon... in my eyes
I am hidden in a fog - my own breath
Sometimes only my anthem of triumph
Echoes in mountainous landscape
Like blood from torn open arteries
Poison flows down the tongue
Somewhere far away a howling can be heard
Oh, how beautiful is the night of Transylvania !
Frenzy of lust, frenzy of pain
Blood is life... ETERNAL !


5. Ancient



6. Entering The Faustian Soul

... With a little fear I kiss the moonlight
How exciting is the thought
About having a taste of your kingdom
Which wakes up to life, at night...
When the servants carry me to the gates of Helevorn
Dreams about unlimited dimensions
Float over Thy Golden Palace
Snowcovered majesty, damned
In nocturnal solitude I pace, deeper into virgin forest
Among sadness and depressive thoughts
Visit firmaments of dead nature
In the glare of black mirror, asleep
Forgotten temples of gods (of forests)
Welcoming the son of godly Teuton, father of fathers
The source of the deepest darkness and magic
The mightiest emperor, cammrad of war
With blessings I join the caravan of my brothers
Like a thunder I strike into the Jehova's armies
I dance with holocauststorms in this battle
I set the holy fire of aurora borealis
This fire, this flame, this redness, live forever...


7. Forgotten Cult Of Aldaron

Since a long time I've visited those old dungeons
I spilled the first blood in the depth
In the darkness of the forest's maze
I found her, morbid beauty
I used to spend whole days
In the mystic places of Delduwath
There, where the light of the halfmoon
Fell as the dying sun
The wolf's howling was lulling to sleep
My young soul...
How beautiful were the views of nocturnal land
How wonderful was the life in complete solitude
Away from villages and towns, mansions and palaces
The last moments give birth to memories in me
Who was that beauty, majestic and great
What were those views, beautifully gilded by leaves
Which were hiding behind them so many mystic wefts
They stole my solitude and independence
I lie crushed by the chains in a wet cell, bleeding
I am awaiting for mother, the last hope, death
Let the died out fire away in me, let it awake Aldaron
Black gusts of dust covered my divine person with their arms
The gates of nature for ages dead, opened themselves
Tears of soil filled the green valleys
Naked Carpathian mountains denudated its might
Rights which created this world
With fury strike heaven, pearly gates
The dark powers of nature unleashed veritable war
The last breaths of sun falling onto the snow
Turned into the scream of the dying light...


8. Wolves Guard My Coffin

Delightful night...
When the fullmoon lights cemetery's valley
Winds of frost strike my tomb
When I am in eternal sleep
When wild storms dwell
Wind blows through the Baltic
Instincts unleash the war inside
And strike the sky with holocausthunder
Mountains sleep, the forest
Covers freezing land where I was born
Now I walk among the castles
Watch the streams of frozen tears
Spilled with blood of forefathers
Nightbreeze feed my spiritual form
And spirits gather, floating in the mist
My eastern empires spread wings of winter
Visions of destructions ruin and tragedies
Tasting pure sin, fade into the pit
And walk through my beloved, endless woods...
I summon all the beauty Evil
To rape the bodies of your disciples
Too long I hide in shades of woods...
And now I build my beauty Hall
Wallachian tyrant, I bring a winter
I come with frost and burning hate !
Follow the Gods of Eastern Lands
Being the battle which blows the earth


9. Hell Dwells In Ice

There was only one long and terrible winter
Where icy blackness covered the sun and the grass
Dethroned light ended its existence
Hell brought there all thunders and winds
All the blasphemy from the four sides of the world
Gods have forgotten this land, where fear
Caught the throat with the bony hand
And the wolf howled gloomy song of cold, frost and hunger...
The lakes enslaved in hard icy shackles
Wild trees covered the happy world
Which will never wake up again !
Life has affected a new form here
Through the icy vastlands run wild
Hordes of wolves, moonless night, that's all
Moon is covered with fresh meat, threw by the hungry hordes


10. Transylvanian Forest

Pure paganism I worship in the woods
Forest's mountains never saw by human eye
Kingdom of the ancient and horned evil
Covered by golden wood and black thorns
My armor like a bark of old oak
I rape my wounds and blood flows down to the ground

Covered by the snow naked crowns of trees
Like crying mothers Slavonic worshippers
Pagan warriors hide in frozen wood
Like black statues born in the heart of winterevil
Ride on the thunders and moonstorms
Where the land is open for full witching moon

Mouth kiss the leaves fallen in the past
Fingers touch the frozen land
Pagan fears fall down on icy skin
Wild eyes filled with darkred blood
Are staring into depths of virgin forest
Where my grave on unholy land

Covered by the snow...

Winds carry me through Transylvania
Virgin evil hidden in the blackest heart
I joined the ceremony of wolves
Where unsilent gods sit high on their goathrones
Now the majesty is ready for pure holocaust
The feast of Babylon whore and her wolf

2. The Dark Forest (Cast Me Your Spell)

Darkness spread its dark wings
Whispers of woods were growing
With every moment
I felt them paying enormous tributes
Powers, which were still alive at night
In the battle of light with dark earth
Spirits of their own nature fight proudly
Live by my side, feed young heart of mine
But I cannot ever see them
I don't know her powers, but I know it's great !
Loves, gives birth, kills - it's powerful !
She raises beautiful monuments by the Baltic
Lives when I sleep and lives in me...
At night raises over dreaming forests
She awakes Gods and Goddesses, unsilently
The night cock she is, whispers wolfish spells
The chants of bard she knows and hums them
Goblins of oaks and denizes of darkness
Bathed in the wine of a delightfull night...
And lives there, but dies at dawn ...
Dies in me with barbarous voice.
The dark forest enchant me !


3. Spellcraft And Heathendom

I've met in surrounding me nature
spirits and deities wielding the element,
in a field, in a forest, in rocks and caves
and I won their goodwill with sacrifices.
Horses carried me to the skies,
White, beautiful steeds ... beloved.
I was attacking brushwood violently
I touched motherland...

Percus ! Magic cirkles and black stones
Percus ! Forest spells and damned souls
Percus ! I find worship in you
PERCUS !!!

They will return, dance like fire, as before
They will return, to the trees,
to the forest of mine... to the kingdom !

The thunderer demons
guards the sacred spot
during those cold nights
they found peace and consolation.

I rediscover the power and charm
to defeat like a sorcerer,
like thousands years ago,
Oaken castles from millenium before,
They will rise once again... as a sign...
Percus !


4. Dragon's Lair

Where the magic stream flows,
Through the shining woods,
Blue grass of wisdom grows
Around the oaken roots...
Where golden dragons fly
And the sorcerers gather,
Four wooden statues stand
And the fog lays thick
Dreamthrone of amber cosmic source of might,
Reflection of wisdom, Power of the darkside
Ceremonial steel drinks the blood,
Painting pearls and gold
Mystic flames burn bright
Around the oaken lord...
Forgotten sorcery storms from the skies,
From the golden hall of the ancient ones
...The Pagan awaits for the equinox...
Cosmic sorcery - the gift of the skies
Magic nature - stronger than your lies
..Stone demigod shines proud...
...The cult of the barbaric seasons,
Pagan pride forever,
Born todie in honour, not to serve on knees
Snowcovered, wild vastlands -
My beloved fatherland...
I see the tears of the oaken one,
My heart is like a stone,
My sword became sharp -
Crosses to break, bodies to dismember,
Flowers to burn ...

6. Rising Proudly Towards The Sky

Fallen into oblivion...
The last view inside my mind -
Silver walls ofg the castle
Risen proudly towards the sky
The rebellion failed...
Many brave ones went down-
Hung on black trees they are
Blown by the four winds
I've been waiting for years,
Growing stronger
Blazing weapons,eyes burn bright
In the dark - as a King I shall return...
Horns sing in the woods,
Hordes gather
Ancient gods of war
Ride on the sky
Old kingdom will fall
Like a moondust...
Reflecting down the walleys-
So pure, hungry for blood
The hearts of the dark ones
Thunders strike...
Dancing on the black mirrors-
The bards of war and venegeance
Came from forgotten realms
As a King I shell return...
To proclaim my victory,
Return of ancient pride,
Laws of steel...
Cold steel...


7. Thou Shalt Forever Win

I break the chains of unbelief
Burden of millenial slavory
Forest, eternat wander
Extending beyond earthly dimensions

Gods will return to their graces together with me
They'll find their oaken kingdoms as before
I free my powers when yelling silently
When I fight... thousands of demons, follow me !

And my strength, and my spell...
And my beautiful pride,
Will find and wrap you will raise majesty to the skies...
From the depths of the earth, deep and black
Through the forests, woods and shadows,
(It) Will penetrate lakes and wolfish mountains...
On the wings of demons to skies !

I denude golden gates of my Nawia
Shrouded in thick smoke of burnt bodies
I show my love... I praise the might
... And destroy with the power of thunders
constantly destroy

On my right hand - fire, eternaly devoted
Together with the strength of thunders
Will dance as before
The conflagration, death and misfortune, let it beget
Rebuild what was ruined,
Destroy what was created by the cross
And my strength, and my spell

2. The Thousand Plagues I Witness

One eyed old man I am
Yet I possess the knowledge of thousand sages
An unborn child I am
Though I have existed for billion years
The invisible army I am
Though the won battle still to come
The father of ambitious and disappointed I am
Brother in sin and abasement
I was Judas in your dream
Who worshipped money above all
I was the roman warrior
Who wounded you and drank the divine blood
I was pilate on your trial
Who spat in your pale face
Each thorn was a sinful spell
Each nail the fulfillment of the revenge
For which I have been waiting for so many years
Hatred for thousand holy heads
And also that many daggers pointed at their visages
The fallen angels, mythical daemons
Triumphant in their blasphemy
I am Gordon, my name is annihilation
Extermination
I am the thousand plagues and afflictions


3. Satan's Sword I Have Become

For ages travelled by the holy fire
Today free, free and triumphant
To no avail for the dungeons and chains of the inquisition
Poor and lonely are my adversers
Who serving the beast for million years
With the whip and crown of thorns
Shall be remunerated today
Wanderer, perpetual and restless
Master, equally hideous & beautiful
Loved and adored... How simple it is...
For many years my semen hath envenomed the races
Abomination to the earthly, to everything that is simple
And obscure at the same time
Therefore let us celebrate the antithesis of the eucharist
With the sacerdoral gesture you welcome us
I am your dazing threshold
Let us commence! We are void of our bodies...
The night, that we are honoured to celebrate
Perhaps the last during which I satisfy my desire
Wanderer, perpetual and restless
Master, equally hideous & beautiful
The real world or the imaginary vision
Still perceptible to my chaotic thoughts
Nothing shall taste the same again...
I am waiting for you to stab the world in its heart


4. In Thy Pandemaeternum

Father!
Art thou blind and deaf?
Old man!
Decrepit and hideous
Hidden in woods of madness and anxiety
I am the beast, thou - the refugium of love
Whereas your love as a cockroach
Under my own boot
I am the Gehenna of humanity, whereas thou art me mercy
And what shalt thou need it for
If the world shall fall asleep under my wings anyway
I am the blood from thy limbs, thou art the wisdom
Is it a great one, yes, vain fools do believe in it
They still go up in flames in anyway
Devils tongue is the tongue of fire
Yes, the same that burneth thine houses
Consumeth light and thy sheep... damned!
And even their wool is shaddy, and the meat poisonous
Not for the hungry dogs at my table
I shall destroy everything, or not...
I shalt throw it to vultures to devour, let them feast!
Devils tongue is the tongue of the night
Whenever thou delight in this beauty
Thou pour in thyself the wine of the underworld
And whenever thou crave for bearing it
There are only the whispers of trees thou can hear
Hungry of thy love, I am anticipating my time...
Devils tongue is the tongue of my father
The one, who with universe constituteth an entity
Father who shall not sell thou out for any flirt
Forlove - affairs, kisses of humanity
Therefore give me his darkness
Power, might, hope and fulfillment
Give me his light
It is the time for the feast of hell...


5. Driven By The Five-Winged Star

Sister of sin
Lover of my unwedden night
In blasphemy we bathe our unclean bodies
We find adoration in the filthy procreation
His will is our devotion
Giving in to the knight of the remote star
Falling in love with the darkest tormentor
The basic instinct, the obscurity of my soul
We hide our secrets damnedly deep
And these are the key to the sempimental glory
To the harmony of body and soul
Immortality, spiritual ecstasy and diableria
Sister of sin
When rich and when poor
On my way to the throne
Lay bare on your gems
The nest of filth (and licentiousness)
Of am I drinking your sweetest juices
The poison in the wine of asceticism
Down am I sitting om the fathers right side
And with his benediction
I am opening the Pandora's box.


6. The Past Is Like A Funeral

Sometimes when I visit the landscapes of the shadows
Something that recalls the grave
Hides in the hellish depths and awaits
When I dream, it peeks into empty goblet
(and) becomes the wine of ecstasy and licentiousness
I know the one in a flock said: "Watch out, watch out"
But I will not go away till I taste the sweetness of your body
No matter it poisons and causes death
The past is like an eternal funeral
Years, thousands of them, I rotted in a monastic cell
I resembled a stone, hiding my murderous self in silence and fear
I lasted in the infinity of meditations and contamplations
Waiting for the deserved dream, there on the holy land
And its taste and coldness I remember
Bare-foot digging my own pit
I was kissing it as if the sweetest lover and begged
But was the sand to become my salvation
Or worms the people on the court of light
The past reeks of an oak coffin, so wet and old
Burning dirty claws in the wooden eyes of Jehovah
I killed mercy, spotting on the laws of god
I celebrated the birth of power
I fall in love with freedom and the beast
And I spat out the Antichrist from my morbid womb
In order to give life to alvine grain
And concentrate the birth of human tragedy & destruction
I envisaged myself as a great magician
Although they called armageddon the whore
Today I celebrate my birth, though I am elder than the world
The past only sometimes is like the sind
That we grave-digger throws in your eyes.


7. The Entrance To The Spheres Of Mars

Freedom - said I
And then the sun set and the dusk
Fell on my life
Transformations and metamorphoses
It was what I experienced there, on the south of heaven
I was striking with my fists at the heavens ceilings
Too low I fell, I did not reach the step-father's neck
Although his visage seemed so close
With bony fingers I desired to clench the crown of thorns
In vain, I have trampled the paradisical flower of love
And I trample its rights here, on the earth
Each sin - my soldier
A daemon of the several thousand strong cavalery
Not gods son I am, but the child of million stars
While each of them symbolises different human fraility greater than mine
I am the wisdom and the perfection of the universe.


8. With Spell Of Inferno

How hard to fall asleep when I miss your majesty
How hard to live when I long for your devil's warmth
And livid skies over Wittenberg
And the empty streets and pavements of the town
Everything sinks into dead tears
And craves for charlatantry
Mephisto you are born inside me again
But will you speak my names in the ancient tongues?
Among thousands flames of profigacy
Naked bodies flowing in the stream of wild dreams
I strip myself of my sacred virtues
The picture of male domination (and treat in blood)
And blood and pride old and clotted already
But I can still see its drops on my bot face
And pain and candles everywhere and incense
And your dream which I wish to wake up in every day...
Everything so ephemental and equally unreal
And this blood and candles burnt away; and they burn till today
Mephistopheles, thousands times I saw in sleep
The essence of the eternal life but have I found it?
If I am who I am, then I shall bombard the human race
with the spell of hell
I shall go deeper down the Dante did
And tame the snakes of mine
Phallic signs and symbols, the seed of truth
And belief in eternal life...

1. Decade Of Thepion

We transgress the context of commonplacenes
We deny normality, trample morality
We destroy angels with sound
We destroy angels with silence

Currents of tantric anarchy seize our bodies
Into the cosmic dance of four scythes
The curtains of Absurd Theatre are raised
Synchronicity - Mother Chaos on the stage

"Wisdom says: be strong!"
Thrilling words are spreading down the spine
Vibrating... "be strong!"
Exhausted I'm running towards the last shines of consciousness
Which is absorbed by shadows of madness

Here are the star and the snake servants;
-they rise the hexagram
Sun - in the triangle hidden ; Sight - sacred visions entwined
And union with Nothingness body I'll find
Strength - go along the Mars path, fighting if we must;
Light - oh, you are Ahathoor, goddess of blue sky

There is might of dawn, in non-quality state I remain
Of commonness crippled time or sand - glass you don't see again
Sigillum dei, picture of myself I'm drawing
With life, venom and hell I'm sprinkling it
His name is Esial, I want him more


2. LAM

Children of technocracy invoke synthetic spirits
Plastic crosses choke perspiring necks
MAAT - I cast dices, but curtain of future is still hermetic closed
Rise! Rise up my Soror, and you, my Father -
High! Towards the stars when the white fire
Which purifies and melts all false sacrament

Ashes' power equal thousands suns
Mysterys' structures are like chaos of known
Objectivism is subjective mandala of reality
Fractals - flaming spaces consume ego's order
Kaos Keraunos Kybernetos

Lamipsos
Illumination in the face of thousand faces
Gnosis obtained by descending into the tunnels of self - knowing
When thunders of ecstasy strike black waves of unconscious sea
I swim, float, drift, scream... "Aiwasss"
And barriers of self change in legion of escaping bats
L.V.X.


3. Ceremony Of Shiva

Avatars of powers from four worlds
Bathed me in jewels of belief
I drink the nectar of Goddess - my eternal mistress
I am Shiva, Hadit or Beast himself
And multitude of forms surpasses myself
I kneel before Isis, I - her god and slave
Coiled serpent lifts up his head and looks in my eyes
Third power and third eye create The One

I am who I am not
I negate and confirm
I transgress - it is real!

Wheels of change turn with my breath
I touch the red - hot firmament (of golden darkenings of heavens)
And stars are falling down onto every side of world
With my tongue I penetrate scarlet abysses of Kteis
Overflowing my body with thrill and heart with warmth
Suddenly I'm shooting forth venom
'Cause I, I became a snake who rounds her flesh
Here and now, here and now


4. Of Sephirotic Transformation And Carnality

Madness creeps through arteries of Grand Cosmic Body
Higher and lover, towards all directions
It violates old laws, repeals all orders
And seeks infinity in holy letters

Child in crown its guide - Ever Coming Son
But it rambles suspended between emanations of Increasing and Descending
Thousand paths across thousand spheres
Mind is torn apart by Macrocosmic Snowflake
Death!

Prismatic trees grow from mad rites
The knowledge of geometry elevated to the dignity of living substance
The Fool in the Universe knows nothing as usual
Transubstantiation of excrement and Styx waters is done!

Carnal alchemy
Sephirotic transformation
In new body god incarnates

Beyond duality, beyond understanding
Castrated man, bastard, secret chief is born
He builds the bridge of agreement -
- spectre of his fall
And he is devoured by the fire of the Abyss


5. The Sermon To The Hypocrites

O, ye whose future is in other hands!
Foul feeders! Slipped, are ye on you excrement?
Parasites! Having the world lousy,
Imagine ye are of significance to Heaven
I, who enjoy my body
[I] would rather pack with wolves
than enter your pest - houses

Sensation... Nutrition... Mastication... Procreation...!
This is your blind - worm cycle
Know ye of nothing further than your own stench?
Heaven is indifferent to your salvation or catastrophe

The sword - trust - not salve - I bring!

Honest was Sodom!
Your theology is a slime - pit of gibberish become ethics
In your world, where ignorance and deceit constitute felicity
Everything ends miserably -
- besmirched with fratricidal blood.


6. Starspawn

I am thine own begotten, Dionysus
Divine Mars, thou call'st me son
And thou, Apollo, my begin gav'st me
That dream hath my mind inflamed
And everyone a star hath become
My brothers and sisters in cosmic ectasy
Millions of sins and virtues were they
And all, the whole wealth of my life
That neither the end nor the beginning had
I could bestow

Starspawn!!!

Exploring our gracious flight, hiher,
We could make love to numberless stars,
With our tiny hand the world embrace
Learn it and forget it, be begotten and die
Forever exist, only mightier and absolute
Myself am Solaris
Universe and oneness
Nothingness and chaos am I
The last bow to thee, Earth, before
I ride a cosmic snake and devour the stars,
Before I become the beast
And no mortal man durst my magic defy
Planet Satan, receive the eternal possessor!
Me for myself I ascend thee
Me for the world


7. The Alchemist's Dream

Welcome to Theatre of Absurd
When the world and rason are audience
And actor illusion and experience only

Here gleams shiny mandala
In the chamber of creation and annihilation
And Lingam links with Yoni wisdom stone make

There is neither space nor time
Books are read backwards or from all side
Everything Will sinks and tears down phantom of mourning

Picture of universe in this simple formula -
"Love is the Law"
Proverb of juggler on the gate engraved
That life is delight
That death is also life


8. Chant For Εshaton

Fly, fly high my Black Eagle
Let golden thread bind our eyes
May our minds and hearts blood unite
On your wings carry me over the abyss
Beyond The Reason and across the burning seas
Then, with your claw tear the earth to the halves
And usher me into the secrets of her bowels
Down to the light of the beginning and the end which shimmers
Circle! Round and round my Black Eagle
Let our senses be touched by ultimate pleasure
May the passion of hunting become all - devouring
Slash! Slash with your beak
Remove all gods from my way, and thoughts, and sorrows
And let me trespass the barriers of fear
Scream! Let the whole cosmos tremble
May echoes become my the sweetest mantra
Spirit of Freedom! Eternal Wanderer! Joyfull Solitude!
Higher and higher towards the stars of Awareness
Let worlds of imagination and fact become one
Where I am you, and you are me

1. Antichristian Phenomenon

Been haunted be the paws ov fear
And felt his breath upon my neck
I was granted with the pain divine
And my voice was heard no more in heaven

Great in power
Thus call'st me almighty
Un not be first archangel
I shall be the last among thee

Come over to seduce your angels
Been born to rape your mother's holy womb
Rebel
So call me now
As I stand above ye all

Leave me unworshipped
In the dens below forever I shall dwell
Malice in heart was bred and lives again
My legions hid in south Eden
My flaming passions
Oceans ov love
And all thou call'st
The evil
I summon thee
Bringer ov war
Bearer ov light
Earth's son

Great in power
Thus call'st me almighty
In not be first archangel
I shall be the last among thee


2. Malice

3. From The Pagan Vastlands

From the land which hasn't entered yet
into the history
From the depths of swamps we are bringing
Proudly our name
As night, kissing the moonlight
-rebel children living in twilight
Like wolves...
...some named us so...

union with people from the sign
Of the half moon
To crush the golden walls of earthly heaven
To strangle the pestilence
Th the lands of mighty Empire
Others even think about us with fear
We invaded a state with a sword
In ours hands Roma means nothing
In the land of Slavs

Today forests sing about the legend
Long forgotten spirits
Whose names nobody remembers now
Waiting their day to reborn
Their visions of past
Are torturing our souls
Whispering in the dark
They will come again
To reign supreme
Believe my woods

From unrememberance
From Fire and Water
Ancient powers gather
From the burnt Arcona
...From the Pagan Vastlands!

Black horse rides across the sky
With a sword we will open the amber gates of Nawia!

4. Satanas

On fire of darkness
rise a scream of hate
Sathanas want vomit
on son of God's face
your eyes have wrath
and promising a slaughter
the angels of Lucifer
are ready to destroy

Sathanas

Sathanas revenge's started
and the heaven is burning
God angels are deads
and the survivors are praying
the sacred cross is breacked
and demons are smiling
because your lord Sathanas
raped the mother of false

Sathanas
Sathanas

6. Day Of Suffering

A call to take your hand
For I'm at one with the dark
How dare you come for me
And again you must die

So ancient curse known to me
Behold the powers I unleash
Upon your throne
Know my words, feel my hate descend

Lord of light
I will swarm against you now
Gods perverse
Wickeds at my side
Misery
Thorns to lance your every word
Nazarene
Now I crown you king in pain

Suffer

1. Sculpting The Throne Ov Seth

3. Conquer All

Mightiest Self!

I write the story ov man
2000 years is nothing
thought it has been enough
come forth victorious
muting the foul angelic choirs!

none ov thy weak brothers, shalt ever share my blood

thus I beheld the truth!

none ov thy empty gods, shall ever stand above me
none ov thy weak brothers, shalt ever share my blood
my awareness, catalyst, ov godhate I have spawned
in sinister ecstasy eternally I'm decomposed

I am the pure flame that burns
I am (ever shining) Sirius son
I am the infinite space
I am the most conquering One

4. The Nephilim Rising

I'm burning like a fucking fire
Mysterious Domain, Murdered Apprehension
Shemyaza, Lacifarus - glow like the Sun
in this final hour
ov Dawn ov the Dusk
I, heart ov all chthonic hearts
vulture eye, fallen one, proclaim:

this great world
is a mirror ov my small self:
striving for infinity, shall I remain?

we cannot kill the time:
it is the time that kills us
and I'm the answer on my questions
and blood ov my hopes and all prayers -
mark the sunset, the last judgment -
and my rainment... -
this is the night, just black damn'd night

as dethroned so enthroned, attracted... rejected...
in this totality is perfection ov Me in Thee
freedom ov Nature, delight ov Existence
so intoxicate me as I intoxicateth thee
slay me as I created thee
when reality is nothing more
than quantum vortex deep sleep
make it lucid dream
or hallucinate if you please
in exaltations ov All, One, None
there Is No Difference
we are the First and we are the Last
Io Pan!

5. Towards Babylon

Leviathan!
eternally Thy powers rage within
I am reborn
purified
in the burning flames ov Sodom
by the powers ov the gods
awaken the mighty Will
that shalt carry me through eternities
Faceless One!
avenge my torment
materialise my utmost Will
beyond all legends and myths
Thou art the emmissary ov the beast
thwart the realm above
spawning might below

"Give us the flesh"!
"Give us the will" I command!
Dumuzi Lord
godhead immaculate!
Thou art the sun
toward the light feel no shame
Ia Asag!
forever Thou shalt remain

in victory I burn
masacrate the enemy
in battle that I hath already won
Thee I invoke
brothers ov Ariman's seed
Thou hast aroused all beings in me
come All in One
resurrected
stronger than death Thou hast become
revert my death
hail to my return
tis time to reign as a god among man

"Give us the flesh"!
"Give us the will" I command!
Dumuzi Lord
godhead immaculate!
Thou art the sun
toward the light feel no shame
Ia Asag!
forever Thou shalt remain
Appolyon
o resplendant flame
begotten ov beyond
may I coruscate eternally
gods ov all perfection
I command - come forth!
in company ov Ur
all doubts and fears eclipsed

6. Before Aeons Came

before the beginning of years
there came to the making of man
time, with a gift of tears
grief, with a glass that ran

pleasure, with pain for leaven
summer, with flowers that fell
rememberance fallen from heaven
and madness risen from hell

strength without hands to smite
love that endures for a breath
night the shadow of light
and life the shadow of death

and the high gods took in hand
fire and the falling of tears
and a measure of sliding sand
from under the feet of the years

and froth and drift of the sea
and dust of the laboring earth
and bodies of things to be
in the houses of death and of birth

and wrought with weeping and laughter
and fashioned with loathing and love
with life before and after
and death beneath and above

7. Mysterium Coniunctionis (Hermanubis)

sounds ov the night
are born from the stillness
censer scent ov the sun
attracts the memories
dark shades - eyes
moths - green pupils
burning echo ov your words
appears
in the heart ov possibility
in extra-real surroundings
there are my passions:
simplicity ov stars
royal Art
alkhemy ov Soul, Body, Word
and I transport
spell ov self-love I weave
and I scream
in the fumes ov antiquity
divine past
in solar room
filled with midnight hour
and midday power
inevitable, immovable
with names witch are Many
with secret meaning:

and I THINK, FEEL, and LOVE
we vibrate light
together
radiate life
on the path to City ov the Sun
angel calls out:
in mysterium coniunctionis deus est homo
and I understand the Burden
ov this journey:
I know, I will
I dare, and keep silence

8. XUL

the son ov morn
what made me so divine?
I, transcending ecstasy through ecstasy
I who am eternally defined by my Will

behold I am the spawn ov downcast Ariman
awakened, yet am no longer human
kindle me to Thy rapture
as I descend into Sheol

Hiva! hear my call!
transform my flesh into flame
Hiya! hear my cry!
sustain my being in million-fold forms

our creed: the living flesh
our law: trespass all the laws
since NUIT is our refuge
and HADIT becomes our light

all stirs within
tis chaos in and above me
in the world ov nether-nether
"I" infinite space is all-consuming

behold! I am unending!
the conciousness ov "I" shines universally
unbound by wretched dogma
I spew my will forth!
hell is democracy!

all things exist in me
I believe in naught save myself
my sermon steadfast and proud:
there is nothing but god in me!

all things stir in me
with joy and suffering
my sermon steadfast and proud:
there is nothing but god in me!

9. Slaves Shall Serve

Khrevsu tvahyu gradu tore!
Khrevsu kvatro midvhu piedhvro!
Khrevsu Kristo midhvu? vhradro!
Medvro vhtrienn utrah vreghgrho

Father ov Terror!
Aba ol-Hol

thru' the galleys ov past
catacombs ov night
into the starry womb

slay, slay!
Asar un-Nefer
we have no fear
our time had come
our will is done

dance, dance!
O Mighty One
in the fields ov Aqert
and spit
upon slaves ov death

War God!
trample all weakness
this is your day ov pride
draw Thy flaming sword
cut the umbilical cord
to set me free from eternal sleep

...step by step
Khem: evolution: spiral vibration
can you hear?
can you touch?
can you see?
can you really see?

we charm all jins -
automata, inprinted realities
they creep like snakes
and all we feel
is painful bliss
as we burn forth
like winged globe
like solar disk...
...and penetrate eternity

Slaves shall serve!
Slaves Shall Serve!
Slaves Shall Serve!
Slaves Shall Fucking Serve!

10. The Reign Ov Shemsu-Hor

O Mighty Watcher!
Thou art all and all art in Thee
free me from mortals
intoxicate with Thy self love
O Mighty Sentinel!
Thou art the concious one
break the monotony ov existence
that I may illuminate!

uncrowned in Tarterean Sulphur
elder than the Memphian kings
Thy reign so timeless and infinite
ever silent watchers, whom mankind yet aches to embrace
grand me Thy Promethean rays
blacker than light...
cunquering lion-headed god
by the name ov Legion dost Thou arrive

Thou hast seen the prophets in the desert
Thou hast bled for the fallen idols from beyond
prevailing stregth hath made Thee greater
than the god...
from amongst the million dead angels army
Azazel, begotten not ov human race
honour the divinity vision ov victorious sun
open wide your glimmering eyes
bathe in divinity ov loneliness
empowered in self creation
shine inward!
Shemyaza! the profoundest one
spread Thy wings
the desolate one
Thy disease untamed within the sinister self...

O Mighty Watcher!
Thou art all and all art in Thee
free me from mortals
intoxicate with Thy self love
O Mighty Sentinel!
Thou art the concious one
break the monotony ov existence
that I may illuminate!

beyond all cowardness!
hast Thou no fear?
spit out the blasphemy!
strive unto sin...

seduce Thyself
o mighty seer!
the ancient voyager
blind me with light

the sleepless ones
in aimless andering
Thou must first fall
to reign in blasphemy...

2. Slaying The Prophets Ov Isa

Ascend as empires burn
Conquistadors ov the promised land
Like the sons ov Anak
They shall rise from beyond the dawn
Rise as victorious trumpets call
Chimera, Geryon and Thee oh Sphinx!
Accompanied by Mars
Jupiter's rays in fearless eyes unrestrained

Astareth!
Bring forth the iron rain!
Hekate!
Bring forth plagues on an ever failing race!

Thou shalt restore the splendor ov Sodom
Personification ov Gommorah art Thou
Iron-willed marching on ahead
With passion enraged threats torn asunder
Fill my veins with liquid iron
Armor chest and head with shining gold
That I may shake the fragile earth
May my will forever be unrestrained

Astareth!
Bring forth the iron rain!
Hekate!
Bring forth plagues on an ever failing race!

Great architect
Charlatan ov fairy tales
Thou hast failed
Since the hour bastard spawn
Who was vomited forth
From a gasping wound ov a whore
Father, forgive me not
For I have sinned
Now tremble and fear
And mercy have not upon me
Begotten son I am not
Adversary ov Thy love
The outcast ov Thy paradise
Despised...

Nemesis!
As one we stand!
Divide and conquer!
And we shall own this fuckin' earth!

3. Prometherion

Hark!
The all prophetic incantation
I was here before the beginning came
And I am the one to come after all myths and gods
Remain I shall beyond the end ov days

I pity Thee not oh self despising slave
Thy self contempt filled with disgust
Cast aside Thy scorn ov the earth
Until I lay my wrath upon the Thee I shall...

Eat the weak!
Fuck the flesh!
Slit the throat!
Consume the dead!

Drowned in empty black
Attempt to embrace my universe
I learnt how to crawl through knives and thorns
Drowned in alienation
I drag myself through the mud
Hatred injected, abhorrence accepted
When mankind fall prey
I shall arise!

And Great Dragon from my mouth emerged
And all the treasures ov this world belong to me
In the sweetest inorganic embrace ov my devotee
I pledge my dagger unto Thee

Blessed with the Promethean rain
Tranquility I may find in bottomless pits
I shall carry this darkness on my back
'Till the day all the suns eclipse I shall...

Eat the weak!
Fuck the flesh!
Slit the throat!
Consume the dead!

4. At The Left Hand Ov God

O, Serpent and Lion!
I invoke Thee!
Inside the shrine called life
By the seven wonders
By myriad mortals
That gone
And are to come
Outside!
Outside desert ov restriction
In act ov rebellion
On the sea ov motion
Stability ov matter
By serenity, strength and beauty
By the mighty chant ov every breath

In serpentine dance ov blood cells
In simplicity ov spells
Divine names, meta-games
I greet Thy presence

Oh Snake! Thou art God!
Coiled underneath my throne
With Thee I reunite
With blood we make this covenant
Myself I redefine
Look in and above:
There is more than the flesh
Look careful and Thou may see
The unextinguished flame
The nectar ov Thy rage
I taste from the cup ov fornication
And woman by my side
And scarlet is her skin
She's eager to rise
And so eager to please

Another day
Another eternity gone
And on the stairway to salvation
I walk alone among the falling stars
Looking for company
Where art Thou?
Oh, lacerate ones!

Arise! my sweetest friend
Or be forever fallen
We have finally arrived
From prison ov this life
To Kali's womb
Down to the earth
As angels ov almighty god-
Chaos!
'Tis our last fall
To touch our mother whore
The harlot ov the saints
That spits on the rotten cross
Incinerate the icon
The symbol ov all loss
To stand straight
At the left hand ov god

Samael! be Thou my ally!
Join me among the bright hosts
Wondering neither way ov light
Nor darkness
Ov which seed
Sprouts dispassionately
In the summer ov my life

From long forgotten aeons
At sunrise Thou shouldst come
Desired for so fuckin' long
Ascend at my command
Surmount the sea
Throw open portals ov life
And scale this endless mountain
Ov grace and ov tears
Oh voice unspoken, mourn unheard
Abandoned heart so desolate

Rise!
Bow down before the kingless throne
When sun is yet to rise
Consume this putrid sphere!
Forever and beyond...

When heavenly chants mute
Thy apparition did I behold oh Venus, the sweetest ov them all
Let me bathe in Thy divinity
Descend! and Thou hast descended
Depart not yet!
I crave for warmth ov blissful rays
And fateless eyes encourage me
The ancient dreaming
The wolf's unchained
Disobedience has such a victorious taste...

Rise!
Bow down before the kingless throne
When sun is yet to rise
Consume this putrid sphere!
Forever and beyond...

Forever abandoned among gods
...Since I have been made flesh,
And yet I challenge Thee!
Canst Thou hear my battle cry?

Non serviam my friends.
There are no gods beyond those made ov human flesh.
There is no more divine potential than a human potential and let this be the mightiest ov all laws!


6. Be Without Fear

Behold the throne ov burning gold
And all the evil that it shelters
Yet I be monarch myself
Offering more than others give

Materialize the ashes ov Elysium burned
Not even angels dare to bid farewell
Annihilate this Eden now
Blasphemy gives birth to divine

Feed my flame!
Leviathan
Rape these wounds!
Asmodeus
Raise me high!
Belial
Through Thy rage my will manifests

I truly am my own redeemer
Blindly I follow none but myself
Without fear I am
Unhallowed be my name

Myself am hell and hell I shall unleash
I laugh at Thee to scorn
Mock Thy majesty
Pour forth my chalice ov victory

Hear my call!
Leviathan
Bless my path!
Amodeus
Lift me up!
Belial
Through Thy wrath my will manifests

Feed my flame!
Leviathan
Rape these wounds!
Asmodeus
Raise me high!
Belial
Through Thy rage my will manifests
Hear my call!
Leviathan
Bless my path!
Amodeus
Lift me up!
Belial
Through Thy wrath my will manifests


7. Arcana Hereticae

What fool are ye!
From zenith to nadir
Through externalized purity
Dexterity
Sealed ye gates ov your own paradise
Skakti, Kali Ma, Durga Ma
Thou art pure in Thy sinistry

For those who cannot see
The Unconditioned One!
Creatrix, Matrix, Devourer!

Thee who spits out sun
From thy mouth
In endless momentum -
Kamala's menstruum
On road to immortality
We go against current
To the womb ov Kali
Through the mouth ov Bhairavi
To the final dawn ov Chaos
How come we're still alive?
In these kingdoms ov filth
When heaven's so abstract
And hell is so real...

8. Libertheme

In my church ov disbelief
It canst get no better
When days turn from black to grey
In church ov indifference
So innocent in their guilt
Perfect in their imperfection
Let my children play

In my church ov liberation
When doubts and fears wither away
I stand alone vs. the world
In the church ov man
Where god is trapped in human flesh
I never pray
In church ov pain
I spoil none but myself
Yet my monologue's unheard

In my church ov hope
Yearning for Thy sweet embrace
The waters ov Styx I have crossed
In this church ov sulphur rain
Flaming mouth ov Sheol
In my church ov broken word
It's so little that I ask
The brightest ov the days
The darkest ov the nights

What once was
I wish no longer be
Fear ov separation is no more
One cosmic breath-the whole eternity
Unbroken flow ov awareness conquers entropy

The voyager, bathed in venusian rays
Let them shine through me
Split the seas
Awake inner divinity
The flame ov awareness comes to my eyes


9. Inner Sanctum

Split my skin, fuck my wounds
Desecrate the Inner Sanctum in which I hide
Drag me through the mud, blind my whitening eyes
That I may see darkness in the tunnels ov light

Pain I cannot deny
As I rot in this empty shell
Swamped in disaffection
Introducing to my newborn hell

Be it not so!
Thou shall see me not in agony
Failure was and is no option
'Tis my undying self
The ever wandering son ov the morn
Abandoned, yet never to be conquered

I never mourn, I never look back as long as Thy phosphoric rays
Grant me more pleasure than pain
I, who is evil can receive no good
Though I still crave, I'm yearning for
Thy healing touch ov grace...

Pain is timeless
When I question the laws ov god
Drowned in everlasting confusion
Caress my hate against the mob

Be it not so!
Thou shall see me not in agony
Failure was and is no option
'Tis my undying self
The ever wandering son ov the morn
Abandoned, yet never to be conquered
The opponent!
My life's work is complete...

10. Pazuzu

Hark the howl ov pestilential wind!
Atem, devourer ov life forever blackening!

Sculpted in stone by the Assyrian wind
Semen ov Hanpa has vomited Thee forth
Reveal to us overwhelming might
Release Thy rage destroyer ov lies

Hark the howl ov pestilential wind!
Atem, devourer ov life forever blackening!

Unveil the primal chaos within Thyself
Daughter ov Anu slain, Lamashtu annihilate!
Reveal to us overwhelming might
Release Thy rage destroyer ov lies

Transcending the wrath ov The Great Black
Slay the reptile!
Slay I command!

May 107 complete the cycle
When aeon ov Seth emerges
The desert storms can not be tamed
When concubine ov chaos begins her dance
Reveal to us overwhelming might
Release Thy rage destroyer ov lies


11. Christgrinding Avenue

Reptile!
Spreading sickness and disease among the men
Grubby creed!
What are ye but the soulless meat?
Lunatic!
Cancer consuming Thy race from inside
Beware!
No grace awaits Thee in the crying skies above

I'm on my way
Destination hell
By the power ov will
I shall complete
The devil's work

Vultures attack!
May hell unlock overpowering might
Mourn not, my comrades!
Thou art fateless in the blinding light
Soldiers!
On the altar ov liberation crucify the whore

Rejoice!
Drink to crucifixion
For oppression is no more!

Slay the whore!
Make it bleed,
Make it weep
Let it die forever more
Slit the throat!
Let them rot
Let them pay
Let em taste their own blood
Make em crawl!
Upon this corpse
I shall feast
'Till no hope remains for the twisted mob!

Mithras!
Raise Thy sword of judgment, loose the iron rain
Beat the drum
No earthly power
May hinder nor stop Thee
Sekhmet!
Manifestation ov Mut
Protector ov Ma'at
I call upon the most divine
To spew forth this infecting dust ov life

I'm on my way
Destination hell
By the power ov will
I shall complete
The devil's work

1. Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel

I saw the virgin's cunt spawning forth the snake
I witnessed tribes ov Judah reduced to ruin
I watched disciples twelve dissolved by flame
Looked down on son ov god snuffed in vain

Blow your trumpets Gabriel!
As I beheld the bewilderment ov Eden
Break the bread...and crumb by crumb into the Leviathan's den...
Nations fall prey
Hail my return

Hosanna Hosanna
Tribe ov Judah decimate
Hosanna Hosanna
Root ov David eradicate

Hosanna Hosanna
Let wine ov Sodom fill our mouths
Hosanna Hosanna
May Sin ov Gommorah grace our hearts


2. If I Were Cain

Ascending in sectarian rapture
We are an oracle ov locust
Sanguine as yet anointed
We rave the pearly gates

Walk with me, Kaiafhat
Pilate, lead the way
I call upon Cains ov this world
We are marching to the funeral ov God

Illuminate
Adoration ov murder,
Raise up the rusty knife
To pierce the heart ov your brother

Cast your stones
Lapidate me
Cursed be the Paraclete
Pour salt into my wounds
So doth Lord speaks through thy deeds

I shall redeem my spirit
Just grace my crux with sin
If you give me the nails
I'll hammer them in

Illuminate
Exploration ov darkness
I raise the rusty dagger
To pierce the eye ov JHWH

1. The Black Goddess Rises

Thee I Invoke, bornless one
All woman, pure predator
Wherein conspiracy and impulse dwell
Like a seething fall from grace

Thou art pale hecate
Rising from thessaly

You're in my dreams
The Darkness in my heart
The rapture in their screams
Black Goddess Rise...


2. Unbridled At Dusk

A celebration of the damned
The unfettered few who choose to roam
Sharing more than sexual excess
Sowing more than vexing stones

Favourite haunts of depravation
Where the morning fears to tread
Covenant revere the sullen cain
Strike the tethered liar dead

Dark solstice fever burns in me
Like the tugging of my veins to feed
Ravaging Raven-Lust
Unbridled at dusk


3. The Raping Of Faith

Flowers lift your precious head to me
I have come to her warm embrace
The gentle touch of surreality
A sweet kiss from beloved faith

The gardens swim with fervent life tonight
I sense the beauty that waits for me there
Dancing with the statues in the pale moonlight
The velveret whisper at play with her hair


4. As Deep As Any Burial

Thrill, kill the black cult
Walk among the weak by night
Affliction...
Deep as any burial

Take their worthless lives...


5. Fraternally Yours, 666

Pour submission into me
No church shall bar our paths
Seductive evil drink...
your fill of the bleeding christ in your arms

Where scorn is fed in the blackest fucking soul!

2. The Principle Of Evil Made Flesh

From the primeval mass
Let precious chaos vent
Sacred flesh drenched in fornication
Beloved by Set
May the winds gather her together
From the secrets of men
After thousands of years of terrifying silence
She comes again

(All Destroyer)

The abolition of the yeshua begins...

Shattered are the icons of the worthless
The Goddess scorned is a Valkyrie born
Scattered are the wings of the virulent holy
Leave their husks to be the prey of vultures and dogs

World without end
Cherish the lissome wants of pernicious evil
Dusk in her eyes
Torn bloody weeping skies
Darkness will hasten to devour
And the weak will flee or die

Sie sind es die sich
An der Liebe festhalten
Für immer betend auf knien
Vor der finsteren göttin

I slay the lamb in the fervour of thine
Abandonment unto Our Lady
With a quenchless thirst for the infinite
For Her that exists beyond all knowledge

Storming from tired centuries
Under the glare of a waxing death-moon
Terrible beauty of love severed
Rip the baby from the virginal womb

The blood of Jesus
Is the wine of the dead
And the drunken angels
Bleed with incest

The Liliot suckle on Her fruitful breasts
And yield the swords that sever and stain
There will be no act or passion wrought
That shall not be attributed to Her names

To the name of Baphomet...
Artemis, Bastet, Astarte

I yearn to thee who art darkness in thy rising

"Weltmacht oder Niedergang"


3. The Forest Whispers My Name

Black candles dance to an overture
But I am drawn past their flickering lure
To the breathing forest that surrounds the room
Where the vigilant trees push out of the womb

I sip the blood-red wine
My thoughts weigh heavy with the burden of time
From knowledge drunk from the fountain of life
From Chaos born out of love and the scythe
The forest beckons with her nocturnal call
To pull me close amid the baying of wolves
Where the bindings of Christ are down-trodden with scorn
In the dark, odiferous earth

We embrace like two lovers at death
A monument to the trapping of breath
As restriction is bled from the veins of my neck
To drop roses on my marbled breast
I lust for the wind and the flurry of leaves
And the perfume of flesh on the murderous breeze
To learn from the dark and the voices between

This is my will...

The forest whispers my name... again and again
The forest whispers my name...

I walk the path
To the land of the Dark Immortals
Where the hungry ones will carry my soul
As the wild hunt careers through the boughs

Come to me, my Pale Enchantress
In the moon of the woods we kiss

Artemis be near me
In the arms of the ancient oak
Where daylight hangs by a lunar noose
And the horned, hidden one is re-invoked

The principle of Evil
Evolution has been recalled
Beneath the spread of a Magickal Aeon
I stand enthralled
...In the whispering forest


4. Iscariot

5. The Black Goddess Rises

Thee I invoke, bornless one
All woman, pure predator
Wherein conspiracy and impulse dwell
Like a seething fall from grace

Thee I worship...

Thou art darkest Gabrielle
Lilith who rode the steed
Thou art pale Hecate
Rising from Thessaly

Crush their unworthy idols
No church shall bar our path
Seductive Evil, drink your fill
Of the bleeding Christ in your arms

You are in my dreams
The darkness in my eyes
The rapture in my screams
Black Goddess arise

Nothing will keep us apart
We could kill them all
If our desire tore free
Our union is one, sweet, sinful Eve

And the night draws in beside her
As we embrace the dark side by side
I pour my soul to those eyes full of fire
To harvest the seed ploughed inside her

Archangel, snare the flesh
Suck dry the ebbing wound
Leave them lifeless and broken
My beloved...

Oh, how I have craved for you
You so pure and other-worldly with your scent of Winter
Am I to bleed myself dry just to see your delight?

And the fear retreats forever
(Come to me... Black Goddess arise)
When my secrets are buried in thine
(Come to me... Black Goddess arise)
Under seven stars we came together
(Come to me... Black Goddess arise)
To plot the new age's decline
(Come to me... ARISE!)

Ishtar my Queen
Come forth to me
And help me seize
My future from the House of Death

That in the release of immortality
I should slay their fucking Nazarene
Ah... the lies... the jew... I kill for you

Hidden lusts will break the gates and swarm
As love secretes the thrill for war
The virgin raped shall seek to whore
She-wolf bare your snarling jaw

"Caught in thy net of shadows,
What dreams hast thou to show?
Who treads the silent meadows,
To worship thee below?"

6. One Final Graven Kiss

7. A Crescendo Of Passion Bleeding

Spells lay daggers before me
Passion speaks in grue vehement stabs
Trance my eyes, fix my focus to pain
The tumour grows until the enemy is slain

(Gut The Church)

Slightless storm
Knee-deep in hate I seeth
My purpose here has woken to breath
Total war on the brethren of Men
Millions regardless
Dying by my hand

A Black Age Of Fire
Brief in its vicious eloquence
Removing the dross
Love will arise from the ashes of your loss

Then and only then
Will the pleasure of Eden be mine
And the sinews of life itself will be tied
In the very veins of my bloodline

And their tears taste like wine...

I will rule as a king
And the Goddess will sit as my guiding Queen
In the glory of the earth our crowns are studded
With the jewels of blasphemy

The blood is the life!

I seek to evoke a new order in Man
A flood of compulsion to resurrect Khem
The lion is vexed to uproot and descend
Chaos my steed in the thick, clinging dust
Tempering weapons of criminal lust
I hold sway from the East to fulfill prophecies
Thinning the cause as fresh cells to disease

The blood is the life!

Even the moon will not lend thee her light
The darkness serves will to snuff out human life
That I might reclaim the world as my right

I kill without scruple or silent regret
In haunts of the sinister lunar aspect
For I am the pleasure that comes from your pain
Tiny red miracles falling like... rain

The incessant pall of death surrounds me
But this is not the part of me that wishes to breed
There will be no dread thereafter
The mysteries I reveal unto thee

I stir the hearts of the wisest
By the fools I will always be feared
My Kingdom feeds off their slaughter...

A crescendo of passion bleeding...
On the pale reflection of dawn

Devour The Sun

"The Great Man of his time
Is He who expresses
The Will of his time;
Who tells his time what it wills;
And who carries it out"


8. To Eve The Art Of Witchcraft

Crawl in awful stealth to me
Forever a voyeur I've been
Nocturnal Goddess of the Moon
So she comes, unseen

Thus (Uzza and Azel) speak

The burning seed, is thrust in Eve
And yearning keeps me, captive of desire

Make me as a flower that grows
Forever in your throne
That I might pollinate the world
With darkness as your own
Embrace me in spellbinding eyes
The fire of life that never dies
Tear deeper through my paper wounds
And never leave inside

Love shall consume and bathe the Lady
Whom I worship and ride thereon
She will greet me as a serpent
In her dark, secret Eden
And I will always want
For her witchcraft is
Desire... (Desire...)
My soul is poisoned from within...

I crawl with languid guilt to thee
Forever flushed in sin
Lamia, latria I give
My soul is poisoned from within

Wisdom breeds, fecundity
And her cunt she feeds, to fulfill her desire

To Eve I cum...

Sevenfold my passion wrought
To ransack Eden, and to taste the whore
I cling beyond her sabled court
She is a gateway, to that darkness lost

(Now dream...)

I am the gentle stream
That trickles through the summer glades
Of ever green peace
Therefore we will drink my sleep and dream
I am the bleeding sky,
The snatching wind of war
Blowing through the savage garden
My crown is fire, the erotic sinews of lust
Like strings to be pulled, and cut
I will make my puppets dance
The men will bow down before me
To take my flesh as lucid thoughts
Of dark, unbridled lust
I am all these things and more
Thus I await you, nemesis of restraint
The code of life, and the bride of evil itself

Oh, the fevered need for Her
When greed and lust are sharpened in that one desire
The all-consuming fire
Reveal to me your mysteries, Witch
The tree is plundered but I have the seed
To be sown in thee

"Mon sortilege a ete le pouvoir qui diovent
Avoir les ames fortes sur les espirits faibles"

9. Of Mist And Midnight Skies

We, the nocturnal few
Bound by other laws
To the service of the enemies of god
Are silent and hidden
Yet our exquisite fire burns on
Poised to engulf...

Tie a man to his god
He may not walk for fear
Of falling foul to temptation
Where once faith stood her ground

Renounce the guilt, ignite the flame
Cast the fetid virgin back from where she came
Drink deep of the promise in my eyes...
Of mist and midnight skies

I drown in fathomless dreams
And in the reeking mire of virtue scream
I yearn to sell my very soul
(And you shall
For none so dark & sinister
Will arise to embrace the Arts)
Do What Thou Wilt
Until the stones in my heart stand still
Regardless of the cost to your repugnant god

The last May frost may blight the crops
And will never be ascribed to be heavenly dog
Or nature, but infernal tasks...
"By your cursings and imprecations
You wrong both Man & beast
By whatever whim you serve
Of the Devil your leige"

Tie belief to the trinity, and seven ways
Will be wrought to condemn thee
Conspiring to cull the pagan ways

Twist back their lies, personify their needs
The war begins by Satanic decree
If Evil we be, we will our lives...
To mist and midnight skies

(I will avenge the deaths of a thousand burning children)

Be bound to a covenant with us in our hellish league
And bring the host of the Nazarene to their knees
Breath the life of an entity never-born
Darkness now descend in raven form
The words, the burning rasp, vibrate the cosmic thread
Arcturus is risen Queen, hold forth the severed head to me

I pour my lovelorn kisses at your feet
Raper of all my worldly enemies

Lycanthropy, please poison me
Send acausal instincts crawling through my brain
Take me, Mistress, until perversion is fed
Dark Magick pleasures weaved under the jewelled moon-head
The cross-stick will fade when the usurper hangs
For now we congregate where once my angel sang

That night they came and took her away from me
I lost the woman I loved and I learned how to curse
And to spit in the face of their Jesus fucking "God"

We will ride again
In the midnight skies


10. In Secret Love We Drown


11. A Dream Of Wolves In The Snow

"Oh, listen to them
The children of the night
What sweet music they make"

May dreams be brought that I might reach...
The gentle strains of midnight speech
And frozen stars that gild the forest floor

Through the swirling snow
Volkh's children come
To run with me, to hunt as one
To snatch the lambs of Christ
From where they fall...


12. Summer Dying Fast

Through acrid clouds of summer flies
The garden swells with a thousand more wise
Forever flung to celestial dreams
Clawing at the grave of the dead Nazarene

I watch the storm approaching
The darkness calls my name
The trees are growing restless
They feel the season change
Their fruit has putrified
Forbidden once and bound to die
The thread of life lies severed
On the brink of paradise

Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Dash towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch her veil
Reclamation, our time has come...

Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last...
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies

They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?

Will they know of majesty
Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their "god" of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from Chaos roused for war?

WAR!

Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end
"We are what we are, what we shall be, again..."

Appear; draped in terror
To the comfort of your kin
Stain the milky sunset red
And let the others in...

Summer's dying...


13. Imperium Tenebrarum

Swords in hand at the bloody fields of history
We rend our blades through dogma and humility
Carve the future according to our will
Set worlds ablaze with our seething fire
Let you all acknowledge that we are here
As masters to rule this failing humanity
Our beings formed in rage and defiance
With strength to trample the weak and the foolish
And so we march with burning brands
Temples of flame on our path to glory

2. Heaven Torn Asunder

Rise, ablaze, libidinous
Devildom voyeurs
Ascend to smother the light
Nascent aeons confer....

Chaos is spat
From the black eternal sea
Serrated mountains of mad shadows
Carving towards misdeed

Stormchoirs gather
A pestilential hiss
Sunset evokes Luciferian fire
The skies are ruptured like a knifed orifice
Supernal vestments hang tattered
Cathedrals shriek to pulpit oratory
Invasions scale Babel's ivory towers
Poised to sodomise a world upon it's knees

(Victory spent
Breathe deep benighted scent)

We are as a flame born unto the darkness
Desires burning in palatial glades
And virtues once aloof, now worming beneath us
Shalt see their children, pleasuring as slaves....

Attack!

Wreak atrocities on those we have despised
Judgements be riven, from the skies
Darkness empower let us master prophecy
Fulfilling destiny - the promised fever

Bedizens eyes paralysed with blasphemy
Written in flesh across the howling ether

Artemis
Spread the bliss of this Lupercalia

With stars erased, throw wide the gates
The infidel soon unmasks her face
Neath silken shroud she waxes horn
Sharpened to skewer dawn....

I am as a plague, born to the priestess
The secret amour of her archangelic rape
Jaded-eyed when my lovers, possessed
Screamed out their agonies, upon the stake

"The most August sorcerers of Hades
Darkly seized for me a throne
And the upraised scythe so terribly scribed
Vengeance in Jesuit blood on stone

From this ransacked celestial temple
I hold the prophet's severed head unto all nations"

Tremble before us
Lords of the star-veiled red sepulchres
Rushing deathwards, our Tartarean fires
Kindle pandemonia to furnace the earth

"Our voices are opened graves
Through which the never-dead escape"

From dank, abyssic dream
Pursuing ascendancy....

The enemy has held three seasons
Imparadised, whilst we writhed
To psycho-dramas penned by aerial decree
Now freed to plunder....
Heaven torn asunder


3. Funeral In Carpathia

Candelabra snuffed prey - silhouette wedded
Nightfall take my hand
Seduce me with silky timbred limbs
Grant me thy dark command
Over the peaks framing tapestries
Of thick forest, dusk has filled
With Lucifugous kisses enwreathed in mist
Creeping like violations from the shadows
to kill

Lucretia
is my love in vein
When thy tears bleed sweeter
Thank the midsummer rain?
Bewinged, infested belfries
Toll o'er the sobbing throng
A writhe of lethargic, terrored nudes
Whipped and welted neath the barbed windsong....

(in saddean paradise
Ancestral legacies linger on....)

I am He
The crowned and conquering darkness
Satan robed in ecumenical filth
Livid Bacchus sustained by bridal echelons of sylph

This wintry eve when the snow glistens deep
And sharpened turrets wed the jewelless skies
I shrug off the shroud of preternatural sleep
Enbroided by these words Malaresia scribed....

"Beauty slept and angels wept
For Her immortal soul
In this repose, all evil chose
To claim her for their very own"

Carpathia
The pleasured dead speak of her
In necromantic tongue
When ambered daylights are done

Masterbating in their graves
On her zenith to come....

This catafalque night when awed stars report
Their absence from the heavenly brow
Crippled seraph shalt cower in illustrious courts
Whilsts the cloaked maelstrom resounds throughout

"How the storm it fulfills
My heart though unhealed
Celestial knifes ebonied
And wild woods thrill
Yet far fiercer still
Her lustre eviscerates me"

Carpathia
Priapic lovers twist in concert with Her
Covenants are struck, jagged lightning fellates
The path towards the castle weary innocence takes

I rule as Master here
Where feral hordes impart my temper
Love sank wounded when I, betrayed
saw death etch cruelly, upon my lineage

"Usher the spite seething Draconist
And commit this world to thy ancient
sovereignty"

Erunescent veil descend
Psalmed sunset thus portends
And laid to rest, I now am blessed
With this darkness.... Forever more

Supreme Vampiric Evil


4. A Gothic Romance (Red Roses For The Devil's Whore)

Evening minuetto in a castle by the sea
A jewel more radiant than the moon
Lowered Her mask to me
The sublimest creature the Gods, full of fire
Would marvel at making their Queen
Infusing the air with Her fragrant desire
And my heart reeled with grave poetry....

From grace I fell in love with Her
Scent and feline lure
And jade woodland eyes that ushered in the impurest
"Erotic, laden fantasies amid this warm Autumn night
She lulled me away from the rich masquerade
And together we clung in the bloodletting moonlight"
Pearled luna, what spell didst thou cast on me?
Her icy kiss fervoured my neck
Like whispering waves 'pon Acheron's beach
In a whirl of sweet voices and statues
That phantomed the dying trees
This debauched seductress in black, took me....

In a pale azured dawn like Ligeia reborn
I tore free of my sleep - sepulchre
On the sea misted lawn where stone figures, forlorn
Lamented the spectre of Her
Bewildered and weak, yet with passion replete
I hungered for past overtures
The curse of unrest and her ardent caress
Came much more than my soul could endure....

I, at once endeavoured to see Her again
Stirring from midnight's inertia
Knowing not even her name
On a thin precipice over carnal abyss
I danced like a blind acolyte
Drunk on red wine, her dead lips on mine
Suffused with the perfume of night

For hours I scoured the surrounding grounds
In vain that we might meet
When storm clouds broke, ashened, fatigued
I sought refuge in a cemeterty

Sleep, usher dreams
Taint to nightmares from a sunless nether

Mistress of the dark
I now know what thou art

Screams haunt my sleep
Dragged from nightmares thou hast wed together

Lamia and Lemures
Spawned thee leche
To snare my flesh

Portrait of the Dead Countess

Deep stained pain that I had dreamt
Flaunted demise, life's punishment
Leaving little strength to seal this wretched tomb....

But poised nectar within my stirs
Up feverous desire and morbid purpose to search
Through cobwebbed drapery to where she swoons
Goddess of the graveyard, of the tempest and moon
In flawless fatal beauty her very visage compels
Glimpses of a heaven where ghost companies fell
To mourning the loss of god in blackest velvet
Enrobed in their downfall like a swift silhouette

"Fleeting, enshadowed
Thou art privy to my sin
Secrets dead, wouldst thou inflict
The cruel daylights upon my skin?
Dost thou not want to worship me
With crimson sacrifice
So my cunt may twitch against thy kiss
And weep with new-found life?"

Red roses for the Devil's whore....

Dark angels taste my tears
And whisper haunting requiems
Softly to mine ear
Need-fires have lured abominations here....

Nocturnal pulse
My veins spill forth their waters
Rent by lips I cherish most

Awash on her perfidious shores
Where drowning umbra o'er the stars
Ebon's graves where lovers whore
Like seraphim and Nahemah

"Nahemah"

Pluck out mine eyes, hasten, attest
Blind reason against thee, Enchantress
For I must know, art thou not death?
My heart echoes bloodless and incensed....

Doth temptation prowl night in vulvic revelry
Did not the Queen of Heaven come as Devil to me?
On that fatal Hallow's Eve when we fled company
As the music swept around us in the crisp, fated leaves
UNder horned Diana where her bloodline was sewn
In a graveyard of Angels rent in cool marbled stone
I am grieving the loss of life in sombre velvet
Enrobed in Death's shadow like a swifter
silhouette....


5. Noctumal Supremacy

Weak midnight promises of love
Were wept upon Her grave
And shunned by stars above
In mortal life lurks my dismay
An Angel stole my heart
and Death took Her away

She sleeps beyond the grace of god
A dreaming beauty
If wishes could only fray that bond
The dead would sing for me....

Twelfth moon arose with ghostly voice
A poet's serenade
Her name a whisper 'pon my lips
And lo, Rorasa came

"Fear me not my grieving King
Funereal in breath
The secrets of the dark I know
And thus, we shall cheat Death"

My promises wrought though despondence that night
Have delivered me gifts from the grave
Rorasa enshadowed and eternal life
Never a Devil so vain
The Angel is fallen, for I thought her lost
And no heaven would silence the pain
Teach me these secrets, the sensual frost
Desire for warm blood again

Princess lay down thy florid cheek
In drunken splendour
Tonight rare regal fate has cast
The wolves among the sheep

Dark nature clasp my soul
Around Her throat mine arms enfold
To sleep, perchance to dream
And then....
To dusk and flesh ascend

The Sun descends, magenta spirits fill the skies
and wreak erotic maladies where sex and Death abide
From writhing tides where gothick siren weave their song to shore
Through the ashes of the battlefields where ravens and angels war

We rule like the red and risen moon upon the sea
The stars of judgement silent, for we share joyous
Eternity
Damnation
Salvation
Stigmata plague

The wine of Bacchus flows
Listen to the thunder rage

Deceivers dragged before their cross
I am He that vanquished Death
And bore the sting of loss
What vulgar christ will unprise my grasp?
His temple, ruined, burns
And sweet Rorasa laughs

I am enamoured and imparadised
To catch the fires dancing profanely in her eyes
"I will crush them all
If this holds thy delight"
Rather dead forever than to lose her
Nymph-lascivious Aphrodite


6. Malice Through The Looking Glass

Take away the wine
For restlessness plagues me....
I am assailed by a spectre profounder
Than hatred and grief or the sum of their hideous crime

I shalt suffer this confessional mime

Awaiting the sun to set, crimsoning seas
Only once it is dark doth my misery cease

She died to a sky dressed in flame
Eyes full of curses for her killers by choice
Who fell to their god o'er her vision and voice

"I am as dusk come to ravish the light"
Steal me from their stares and mute christ into night
"I will answer thy prayers"
If thou Wouldst drink of my life....

Encroaching evening skies
Die with such tragedy
And those interred in cold graves
Dwell on pleasures to be
In deep hysteria
Where our legend still breathes
Through sweet death and thereafter
Sweeping nightmares.... shalt feed


7. Dusk And Her Embrace

When the sun has wept upon the waveless lake
And the mists steal in with ease
Covened wolves are their eerie dissonant napes
In adoration of the moon and thee

"They call as I to thee...."

And I will come, as if in dream
My languid, dark and lustrous Malaresian Queen
Of vengeful, ancient breed
Gilded with the pelts of many enemies
Erishkigal, raven-haired
Thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
I can taste thy scent by candlelight
Legs of porcelain traced and laced to their lair
Appease the beast on spattered sheets
Dyed unearthly red as sobriety weeps

Nocternity....
She shall come for me

A black velvet painting sprung to elegant life
Like a poignant Madonna perverted to night
And I have ridden from the westerning light
To expend my lust
Tear away the funereal dress
Know that I will escape from my death
Surrendered to the splendour of her sharpened caress

Lo! The pale moonlight
Weaves a poetic spell of vital death and decline
Of mist and moth and the hunger inside
Kisses took to fever and the fever, demise

"Through twilight, darkness and moonrise
My scarlet tears will run
As stolen blood and whispered love
Of fantasies undone"

Countess swathed in ebony
And snow-white balletic grace
Rouge-filmed lips procure the wish
For lust and her disgrace

Dusk and her embrace

We shall flit through the shadows
Like a dream of (were)wolves in the snow
Under deadly nightshade
Still warmed with the kill's afterglow

Beneath the stars thy flesh bedevils me
(Beneath the stars taste the death in me)
Bequeath to me thy fiery kiss
To sever thin mortality

Elizabeth
My heart is thine
Thy fragrant words Warm within like wine....

"Let me come to thee
With eyes like Asphodel
Moon-glancing, loose desires free
To writhe under my spell"

Ereshkigal, raven-haired
Thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
I know thy scent by candlelight
Immortal flesh I yearn to share
Appease the beast on spattered sheets
Dyed malefic red as sobriety weeps
Nocternity
She shall come for me....

Unfurl thy limbs breathless succubus
How the full embosomed fog
Imparts the night to us....


8. The Graveyard By Moonlight



9. Beauty Slept In Sodom

Death, spirit me away
My anguished soul doth strain
On taut and twisted reins
Yet, insatiate I still remain
Like a proud, unfalled star
That dares thee from afar
To calm my thund'rous heart
Else, rend it's knots apart
So I may never sing

Of jewelled skies o'er my strings
And love, a wanton thing
Can plunge on burnt, black wings
To hang amid the thorns
In scarlet, like velvet worn
About the clouded moon
Who wanes in solitude....

I am alone
Thirsting for the dark
That lurks beneath marbled stone
What black witchcraft
Shalt prise thee from thy dreams
And what perverse world-strategy
Will wend it's way with thee from sleep?

"Rouse my disease
And with cadent naked dance I shalt teach
Thee wisdom of darkness
From earth and red sea

Lightbearing Samael
Coalesce with me...."

Twilight
Through pagan city gates
Bred shadows play like twining snake
By candlelight
Thanateros rites
Death seduced and chaos wakes....

Obsession grips, blindragon fever
In throes of scythed orgasm, Eros dies
And Saturn rapes faith's lovelorn Diva
Upon a cyprean altar, stripped bare for sacrifice
Virtue births a demon
Pandora's box, unhinged, sets loose the night
Winged lilith born for want of Eden
Fanning plumes of harlotry
Like pearls before the desert swine

The skies, they darken
And the oceans part

Storm forth indignant Kraken
Reborn Venus as thou art
Feasting at my banquet
Of Saturnalia
I call thee having wrestled
The tides from lonely Diana

"For thee Endymion
I forsake the cerements of this star-flung tomb"

Be-with-us come
Unveil the ancient flame
Throw the cats our enemies
Desire's menstrual strain
Eastern Devil eyes
A cruel erotic plague
The Shekhina is in exile
And the Israelites enslaved to shame

Midnight
Jerusalem
A tenebrous phantasy
Revelates to men
Their celestial walls crumble
When walks the Xul
Born to the scarlet whore in Babylon

The centuries of wait have all but gone
Behold dark beauty stirs to conquer on and on

Now worship Everything


10. Haunted Shores

Herodias and I have led a phantom cavalcade
Through veiled and pagan history where superstitions reigned
And Christendom sought to pervert, but poets of my name
Sang of penumbral victories that sorcery had claimed
The Graal and mighty Caliburn as votive offerings
To an England rearisen under vast majestic wings

These are the shores whereto my soul
Blood drenched and unredeemed
Shalt seek solace in secrets told
Through the whispers of a dream

From the woods Pendragon-born, I rose Arcturius
A proud, audacious King mantled in the
vehemence of lust
Death and destiny undaunted me, I drew a throne divided
In awe of the glorious battles won, my dark Goddess provided
Then treachery, a wingless beast, came crawling to my court
And now I lie at cursed Camlann, from wounds a traitor wrought

I fear the Augean light
is sweeping through Camelot
How bittersweet my triumphs seem,
now Autumnal leaves succumb to frost
Morganna art thou near me?
Languid, I wend my path to grave
Cast my sword to the sulphyd grasp
Of the naiad neath the silvered lake
When waters stirred lay silent

Mistress let the mists descend
Thy tears cannot thaw Death's cold heart
His sombre gaze defies legend
More so than thine, else thy dew-lidded eyes
Art for the Banshees song
Or our souls entwined like vein upon
The haunted shores of Avalon

The haunted shores of Avalon

Bury me in velvet dream
Lest I unduly wake
And seek to reconcile my thirst
With the cowardly tailors of my fate
Unleash mastiffs of snarling night
To overthrow, plague and burn
As slumber lures me 'mongst the dead
To scheme of my return

Archaic ghostly echoes breathe like thunder of the storm
A tempest fools miscall divine as they crouch awaiting dawn
Their ignorance has forged for me over
centuries a sword
Burnished to flash like lightning on the precipice of war
The wolves are dead in Albion whilst the
passive flocks roam free
This my penetrant spearhead shalt pierce these foul,
trespassing breeds

I have awoken from the past
Glenfully with the shadows over England's bitter skies
I prize mine wounds in a soil sweated drink
Remember me as king when I cradle hell to stars
Like lovers in my arms, nestled vipers to my breast
Venom forces workthius arts of devil's and priestess
Thus I shall rule anew through the sinews of a song
Played upon a storm
By the ghosts of Avalon
And all in league will bow to me, from death they shall ascend
To whisper weals of war to stir the dark one in men
The principle black metal masterplan

"I have awoken from the past

1. Ebony Dressed For Sunset

"The Life of all Flesh Is The Blood" - Leviticus 17:14

"Those who Trespass against us, Beware the Shadows of Dusk"

Unshadow thyselves children
The reign in flesh begins again...

V empire
Funereal majesty awake
Cneajna wreathed in snake
Draconis talons rake...

So haunted is my silent heart
Dreaming only of the moon
When velvet darkness falls tonight
The thirst crescends anew...

Only for you

Inspired to mortal nightmare
Ebony dressed for sunset
In the dulcet whispers of the damned...


2. The Forest Whispers My Name

Black candles dance to an overture
But I am drawn past their flickering lure
To the breathing forest that surrounds the room
Where the vigilant trees push out of the womb

I sip the blood-red wine
My thoughts weigh heavy with the burden of time
From knowledge drunk from the fountain of life
From Chaos born out of love and the scythe
The forest beckons with her nocturnal call
To pull me close amid the baying of wolves
Where the bindings of Christ are down-trodden with scorn
In the dark, odiferous earth

We embrace like two lovers at death
A monument to the trapping of breath
As restriction is bled from the veins of my neck
To drop roses on my marbled breast
I lust for the wind and the flurry of leaves
And the perfume of flesh on the murderous breeze
To learn from the dark and the voices between

This is my will...

The forest whispers my name...again and again

"When the moon is full
We shall assemble to adore
The potent spirit of your Queen,
My mother great Diana.
She who fain would learn all sorcery
Yet has not won its deepest secrets,
Them my mother will
Teach her, in truth
All things as yet unknown"

I walk the path
To the land of the Dark Immortals
Where the hungry ones will carry my soul
As the wild hunt careers through the boughs

Come to me, my Pale Enchantress
In the moon of the woods we kiss

Artemis be near me
In the arms of the ancient oak
Where daylight hangs by a lunar noose
And the horned, hidden one is re-invoked

The principle of Evil
Evolution has been recalled
Beneath the spread of a Magickal Aeon
I stand enthralled
...In the whispering forest


3. Queen Of Winter, Throned

Even a man who is pure in the heart
And speaks in prayer by night
May become a wolf when the wolf's bane blooms
And the winter moon is bright"

Listen to them
The children of the night
What sweet music they make

Iniquitous
I share Carmilla's mask
A gaunt mephitic voyeur
On the black side of the glass
Peering through the mirror
Deep dark and ominous
Consorting themes, demons I weave
Subservience from thee to lost

I am Corinthian light
A snake in flowers by night
The last temptation of christ
Evil in mortal...

Disguise the guilt
Sharp-eyed, impassive whore
Burn the asafoetida
and rank petriachor
Lure me panthered Faustia
With cunt and veiled womb
To prowl thy inner sanctum walls
In Tirgoviste to resume
Control

Seduction, my obsessive art
A pantheon of tragedies inscribed upon the stars
Like thistled ruin, garbed around thy heart
Bacchanal Cinderella, desirious midnight passed
Leaving thee as sacrifice asleep within my arms
'Midst dreams od robed redemption versed in sexual aftermath
When we ebb as tides together, carnal souls entwined
And orgasms expire, come puppet wires and the blind
(Purge)
Fires work in me
A lithe supremacy
I tear asunder heaven as I would all enemies
Impaler Lord
Flesh upon the sword
My lower lusts are sated, the greater herald war

I am thirst, spearheaded hunger
Sacrament and pain
Nails raked in savagery
When the cruel Countessa came

Exalt!
The Queen of death-white winter enthroned
Evil resplendent, in dusk red seething skies
Foam-flecked nightmares drag a moon
Of Draconian design

A love that never dies
Nefarious silhouettes to rise

When stars fall pale
And to drown back in Her eyes
Is to madden ghosts within
To unhinge a thousand sins
From Death's dark vale

"Blessed be these spells of winter
Unto us that wait with patience in
This secret garden
To storm our way into another
As yes undone"

(Surge)

Desert claims Eden
And Hyperborean
Visions of Utopia are driven from the sun
Iconoclast
Before thee angels clasped
In nakedness their ochre flesh
Shall yield to thy advance

She is all to me
Mysterious, alive
The howling in the deep woods
When cold festal stars aligned

A lurid moon looms; phosphorent, evil
Yesod vested in despotic upheaval
Silvering wolves that scarlet forest snow
Forgotten ones ebter as above, so below

The trees groan aghast as ghostly pallored clouds are rent
When the drunken earth heaves, sweep aside seas to ascend
From Sheol's dank haunted wilderness
Thy seal upon Nuit's starry vault to incense the sleepers,
dead

Queen of Winter, throned
The murderess lurked in vulgar caresses
Vestal masturbation
(Purity) Overthrown

Darkness
In raven feathered dress
Sides with Death at chess
Their pawns are many and the enemy
Powerless
When the miscreants fell dead
She took to conjuring spells in the cusp of the night
And the bestial floor shook with terrible life
I rise before thee Queen
To feed our lusts on the blood of the weak
To rule heaven and worlds crawling beneath
Satanic Tyranny

4. Nocturnal Supremacy

Weak midnight promises of love
Were wept upon Her grave
And shunned by stars above
In mortal life lurks my dismay
An Angel stole my heart
and Death took Her away

She sleeps beyond the grace of god
A dreaming beauty
If wishes could only fray that bond
The dead would sing for me...

Twelth moon arose with ghostly voice
A poet's serenade
Her name a whisper 'pon my lips
And lo, Rorasa came

Fear me not my grieving King
Funereal in breath
The secrets of the dark I know
And thus, we shall cheat Death"

My promises wrought though despondence that night
Have delivered me gifts from the grave
Rorasa enshadowed and eternal life
Never a Devil so vain
The Angel is fallen, for I thought her lost
And no heaven would silence the pain
Teach me these secrets, the sensual frost
Desire for warm blood again

Princess lay down thy florid cheek
In drunken splendour
Tonight rare regal fate has cast
The wolves among the sheep

Dark nature clasp my soul
Around Her throat mine arms enfold
To sleep, perchance to dream
And then...
To dusk and flesh ascend

The Sun descends, magenta spirits fill the skies
and wreak erotic maladies where sex and Death abide
From writhing tides where gothick siren weave their song to
shore
Through the ashes of the battlefields where ravens and angels
war
As phantoms we have fled the basilisk of day
To rise as phoenix taloned, nightly taking prey

We rule like the red and risen moon upon the sea
The stars of judgement silent, for we share joyous
Eternity
Damnation
Salvation
Stigmata plague

The wine of Bacchus flows
Listen to the thunder rage

Deceivers dragged before their cross
I am He that vanquished Death
And bore the sting of loss
What vulgar christ will unprise my grasp?
His temple, ruined, burns
And sweet Rorasa laughs

I am enamoured and imparadised
To catch the fires dancing profanely in her eyes
"I will crush them all
If this holds thy delight"
Rather dead forever than to lose her
Nymph-lascivious Aphrodite

5. She Mourns A Lengthening Shadow

Hasten to the bridal bed -
Underneath the grave 'tis spread:
In darkness may our love be hid,
Oblivion be our coverlid -
We may rest, and nione forbid.

Percy Bysshe Shelley


6. The Rape And Ruin Of Angels (Hosannas In Extremis)

Hosannas in Extremis
Invading tempestuous skies
When Inanna rose, bringing angels repose
And Narcissus' date as their prize
Blinded by Diana's mirror
Wherein coffined truth struggles, forlorn
And covetous stars out their eyes to deceive
The horrors performed on Her shores
As jewelled Ishtar, in darker Aeons
Trespassed Ereshkigal's grasp
Her ravening twin, wreathed in whispers and wind
Now inspires Catharsis to dance
Through the weave of white vaults
Where the shadows revolt
At the incest of spiritual love
Castrata choirs, bereft of such lusts
Spatter virginal breasts with their blood

The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve
(Thirst-ridden) Wolves serenade a moon
Who seems no mistress of Herself
And heavens pour forth vast casualties
Thy host given up for me
Thou which wert once and then ceased to be
Art now ensconced to chapters
Of a lengthening tragedy

Whilst we scream free

Deep forests impale the sinister mist
Their sorcery taught to the clouds
Who muster like mountains, a fountainous wish
To vex the sweet dead from silk odious shrouds

Storm-woken sisters of Judas unfurl
As Psyche to Sapphic lament
Wrapt in thy tresses and taloned caresses
Whisper me secrets beheld beyond Death

"Desires
I was loath to lose
To the virgin-bloodied priests
Whose lord fantasied on Magdalene
And sought to savour Her as a beast

Her aching sex
A rose undone
As mine in tears and spasms wrung"

Ebon Nemesis, slain Jericho's stone
has built thee a marbled stair
By candlelight to Eden and Serpentine throne
Where ravens rape the tenanting angels there

Hurry, else Death may spy us here
And quicken the pulse of dawn
Embering flames writhe to life again
The starry brow threshed with poisonous thorn

Huntress, draw back the silvered bow
Thy dogs set upon the manger
The enemy in throes...

Whilst drifting fogs devour
All Hallows witching hour
On this long, dark seance for the soul

Through malevolent Scylla, Charybdis graves
Our conquesting spirits pour forth, unassuaged
Occultnesses watch us and Seraph, afraid
Like fireflies lounge to Her maw, midst crashing black waves

"Remember with pride what thou art
Lest we forget in awe of our terrible past"

When Dark royalties drank of despair
Idols hewed down 'neath a desert god's stare
In thrall to revenges sworn there
What dreams could we father, when farther we fell
To nightmare?..

"Well versed in misery
We have lain naked in darkest ravines
Now the sun has set in slumber, We delight
Like serpents in arousal
Coiled to strike at the light"

Now abyssed Lucifer's master the earth
Uncloister jaded harlots once served
Enthralled by cruel raptures, rehearsed
Kiss slumbered beauty and weapon our thousand year curse

The laughter of Khaos
Gatekeepers flee the onslaught

A World enslaved to flame
Bondage in Phallustine
Pleasure temples for my bride
Nubian grace swiftly seize
Thieves blood-divine
Empires thrive on sacrifice

2. Thirteen Autumns And A Widow

Spawned wanton like blight on an auspicious night
Her eyes betrayed spells of the moon's eerie light
A disquieting gaze forever ghosting far seas
Bled white and dead, Her true mother was fed
To the ravenous wolves that the elements led
From crag-jagged mountains that seemingly grew in unease

Through the maw of the woods, a black carriage was drawn
Flanked by barbed lightning that hissed of the storm
(Gilded in crests of Carpathian breed)
Bringing slaves to the sodomite for the new-born
On that eve when the Countess' own came deformed
A tragedy crept to the name Bathory

Elizabeth christened, no paler a rose
Grew so dark as this sylph
None more cold in repose
Yet Her beauty spun webs
Round hearts a glance would betroth

She feared the light
So when She fell like a sinner to vice
Under austere, puritanical rule
She sacrificed...
Mandragora like virgins to rats in the wall
But after whipangels licked prisoners, thralled
Never were Her dreams so maniacally cruel
(And possessed of such delights)
For ravens winged Her nightly flights
Of erotica
Half spurned from the pulpit
Torments to occur
Half learnt from the cabal of demons
In Her
Her walk went to voodoo
To see Her own shadow adored
At mass without flaw
Though inwards She abhored
Not Her coven of suitors
But the stare of their Lord

"I must avert mine eyes to hymns
For His gaze brings dogmas to my skin
He knows that I dreamt of carnal rites
With Him undead for three long nights"

Elizabeth listened
No sermons intoned
Dragged such guilt to Her door
Tombed Her soul with such stone
For She swore the Priest sighed
When She knelt down to atone...

She feared the light
So when She fell
Like a sinner to vice
Under austere, puritanical rule
She sacrificed
Her decorum as chaste
To this wolf of the cloth
Pouncing to haunt
Her confessional box
Forgiveness would come
When Her sins were washed off
By rebaptism in white....

The looking glass cast Belladonna wreaths
'Pon the grave of Her innocence
Her hidden face spat murder
From a whisper to a scream
All sleep seemed cursed
In Faustian verse
But there in orgiastic Hell
No horrors were worse
Than the mirrored revelation
The She kissed the Devil's phallus
By Her own decree...

So with windows flung wide to the menstrual sky
Solstice Eve She fled the castle in secret
A daughter of the storm, astride Her favourite nightmare
On winds without prayer
Stigmata still wept between Her legs
A cold bloodedness which impressed new hatreds
She sought the Sorceress
Through the snow and dank woods to the sodomite's lair

Nine twisted fates threw hewn bone die
For the throat of Elizabeth
Damnation won and urged the moon
In soliloquy to gleam
Twixt the trees in shafts
To ghost a path
Past the howl of buggered nymphs
In the sodomite's grasp
To the forest's vulva
Where the witch scholared Her
In even darker themes

"Amongst philtres and melissas
Midst the grease of strangled men
And eldritch truths, elder ill-omen
Elizabeth came to life again"

And under lacerations of dawn She returned
Like a flame unto a deathshead
With a promise to burn
Secrets brooded as She rode
Through mist and marsh to where they showed
Her castle walls wherein the restless
Counted carrion crows

She awoke from a fable to mourning
Church bells wringing Her madly from sleep
Tolled by a priest, self castrated and hung
Like a crimson bat 'neath the belfry
The biblical prattled their mantras
Hexes six-tripled their fees
But Elizabeth laughed, thirteen Autumns had passed
And She was a widow from god and His wrath, finally...


3. Cruelty Brought Thee Orchids

Hear Me now!
All crimes should be treasured if they bring thee pleasure somehow...

Maleficent in dusky rose
Gathered satin lapped Her breasts
Like blood upon the snow
A tourniquet of Topaz
Glistened at Her throat
Awakening, pulled from the tomb
Her spirit freed eclipsed the moon
That She outshone as a fallen star
A regal ornament from a far flung nebular

Her likeness hung in the black gallery
Commanding unease
Demanding of Death to breathe...

Midst the whirl and daylight fauna
Of society at court
Elizabeth bedazzled, Her presence sought applause
Though Her torchlit shadow
Thrown upon damp cellar walls
Greeted nothing but despair from slaves Her nights enthralled

Thirteen Winter solstices had shown
Her path, that the dark
Had marked its dominion
Spaying the confessor
Whose caresses she'd known,
As whipcord in the House of Dog
Her cold cunt meat on holy bone

Raped of faith, She now embraced
The narcissistic unrest frozen on the mirror's face
With this disdain, inside these veins
(Highborn wanton that She was)
She sought to keep what age would claim
Her soul was sold and for this toll
Reeking pyres ever smouldered
On the whims of one so in control
Elizabeth, mysterious.
Cruelty brought thee orchids
From the bowels of the abyss

Once upon atrocity when midwitches stifled cries
And carved abortive runes in reddened wombs
Exhumed by scrying eyes
Madness came upon
Her like an amourous lover's seed
Lifesblood splashed upon Her skin
In gouts torture unleashed

And to Her dead reflection
Twas as if Her pallor gleamed
Like an angel's warmed by candles
Where erotic stains had cleaved
So demons dragged this libertine
Lusts screaming for release
Upon the flesh of maidens preened
As canvas for caprice

Exacting obeisance
Her gaze held a seance
Of spirits too trapped under glass to commune
A sleeter mistress than Luna
Whose threats to consume Her
Met with torments giving vent to Her swoon

Flat on Her back
Pack-prey for the reams
Of verses and curses
That haunted Her dreams
Midnightmare chimed
Thirteen in Her mind
A disciple of scars
Branded years hissed behind
Ridden split-thighed
By the Father of lies
An ovation of wolves
Blushed the skies as they writhed

But Heaven is never forever
She came, a spent storm
From the clouds...

Leaving serpents in office
Inside every gate
To lick righteous holes
Blinding Lords to the fate
Of virgins forced naked
To defile on rent knees
Hacked and racked backwards
Menses choking their pleas

"More. Whore. More.
Twitching make me wet with thee
Carcass rub me raw"

And to Her dead reflection
Twas as if Her pallor gleamed
Like an angel's warmed by candles
Where erotic stains had cleaved
So demons dragged this libertine
Lusts screaming for release
Upon the flesh of maidens preened
As canvas for caprice

Raped of faith, She now embraced
The narcissistic unrest frozen on the mirror's face
With this disdain, inside these veins
(Highborn wanton that She was)
She sought to keep what age would claim
Her soul was sold and for this toll
Reeking pyres ever smouldered
On the whims of one so in control
Elizabeth, mysterious.
Cruelty brought thee orchids
From the bowels of the abyss
From the bowels of the abyss


4. Beneath The Howling Stars

Midwinter wrongs the rites of Spring
Her spinal chill rakes the earth
Whilst pensive souls at zero sing
Woebetidings of rebirth
Under cold stares of Mars maligned
Near-suicides cross their hearts
And unborns writhe in tepid brine
For something wicked this way starts

Beneath the howling stars

Elizabeth, paragon of vice
Watches the sun set pyres alight
As Bane and Tyranny, Her Dobermans sleep
Like spellbound paramours at Her feet

A chatter of bells without
Raise hellhounds, teeth on edge
From sleighs hastened through snow lit red
Guests espied from the garret ledge

Great gloomy mirror tell Her face
She will outblind them all
That heavenly bodies would fall from grace
To possess such a lustrous pall

For beauty is always Cruel...
For beauty is always...

(Let destiny in chains commence...
Damnation under Gods seeking recompense
Enslaving to the whims of this mistress)

As the dance ensued
Elizabeth's mood
Tempered by the craft of a vitreous moon
In slick black iciness it grew
To consume
The wench Her tower tombed
Tending to Her costume
Bore the brunt of the storm
When the needle askewed
She has Her dogs maul the bitch's wrists through
Restored to jaded bliss
This evisceratrix
Descended to the ball
With painted blood upon Her lips
Passing like a comet so white
As to eclipse
The waltz wound down, transfixed

Devoid of all breath in the air
Even Death paled to compare
To the taint of Her splendour
So rare and engendered
'Pon the awed throng gathered
There...

Beneath the howling stars

She danced so macabre
Men entranced divined from Her gait
That this angel stepped from a pedestal
Had won remission from fate
By alighting to darker spheres
Delighting in held sway
For She was not unlike the Goddess
To whom the wolves bayed

"Whilst envy glanced daggers
From court maidens, arboured
Who whispered in sects
Of suspicions abroad
That Elizabeth bewitched
See how even now the whore casts
Her spells upon the Black Count
Whom Her reddened lips hold fast"

Tongue unto tongue
Swept on tides without care
For the harpies who rallied
Their maledict glares
A halo of ravens tousled Her hair
Chandeliers a tiara
For passions ensnared

"Phantasies sexed
When their eyes, moonstruck met
Their friction wore a way
Through the sea of foreplay
Lovers at first bite
She an Eve tempted to lay
Gasping at rafters
Flesh pressed in ballet"

But caprice, honours leashed
She absconded the feast
To prowl wonderland
Beasts in hand from the Keep
Of Feudal dilemma
Well mantled in furs
Through cullis to watch
Dogstars howl at the earth

On this violent night
Unholy night
Winds lashed their limbs together
As the ether vent its wintry spite

She wished His kiss on Her frozen landscapes
To excite the bleak advance
From castle bowers
Wherein small hours
The Devil never came by chance
A lone charm tied to Her inner thigh
Sent lusts nova as hooves trod
Cobbled streets where lowlives fleet
Were flung to a wayward god

Midwinter wrongs the rites of Spring
Her spinal chill rakes the earth
Whilst pensive souls at zero sing
Woebetidings of rebirth
Under cold stares of Mars maligned
Near-suicides cross their hearts
And unborns writhe in tepid brine
For something wicked this way starts

Beneath the howling stars

Pounding upon the pauper ridge
Earshot of a hunched beldame
Elizabeth teased, would He dare to please
Such elderly loins enflamed?
To this He feigned a grim disdain
Playing to Her slayful eye
But the hag replied...

"This girl that chides
Will soon be as plagued with age as I"

Her consort laughed a plume of icy breath
For Elizabeth's grace could raise
A flag of truce in burning heaven
Or the dead from early graves
Yet still She seethed
This proud Snow Queen
Embittered with the cursed retort
And because He sought Her loves onslaught
He gutted the crone for sport

Soon in full moon fever they were wed
Lycanthropic in the conjugal bed
Littered with aphrodisiacs
To tease dynastic union
And beget them further maniacs

Elizabeth
Free reigned, now a Countess
Outwielded and outwore
Her title like a favoured dress
Whilst Her errant Lord
Whose seasons savoured war
Stormed black to fell the infidel
Her embers, tempered, roared.


5. Venus In Fear

6. Desire In Violent Overture

Nights came tralling ghost concertos
Heartstrings a score of skeletal reaper bows
Playing torture chamber music allegretto
Conducting over throes trashed to crescendo

Skinless the dark shall scream
Hoarse Her symphonies

Deathmashed as the moon
That had lifted Her dreams
And frowned on the winding steps down
To where the vulgar strayed,
Taunting sick Her tender prey
She glided in Her bridal gown

How sleep the pure
Desire in Violent Overture

An emanation of phantom madness
The Countess beheld in shroud
By girls bereft of future vows
Soon to wed in white the frosted ground
Burning like a brand on the countenance of god
A yearning took Her hand to His Seraphim, bound

Deep red hissed the cat whips
On the whim of ill-will
Whilst She entranced, nonchalant, abliss
Flayed further songs of overkill

How weep the pure
Desire in Violent overture

In a crescent-whime cellar of crushed roses
Pooled blood and broken dolls
A torchlit shadow theatre souled
With the echoed cries of lives She stole

Killing time
She struck the hours dead
In Her control
Thus menopaused
Her clock of hacked out cunts
Began to toll

"Thirteen chimes of ancient strain
I conjure forth with dirge
That fills the void with timbred pain
To fulfil my sexual urge"

Frights came wailing from the Darkside
Haunting lipless mouths a fugue of arcane diatribes
Velvet, their voices coffined Her in slumber
Bespattered and appeased
As pregnant skies outside bore thunder

How sleep the pure
Desire in violent overture

As when high winds
Attune whipped trees
Her savage nature pitched
Would once again conduct the pleas
Of those She loved to agonies

As if it were
The first time every night
That She carved Her seal
In the flesh of life.


7. The Twisted Nails Of Faith

"Mirror, mirror on the wall
Shouldn't not grave pleasures be my all?
For if I shall see thy Will be done
Grant Me the Witchcraft of thy tongue"

Three moondials froze in the shadow of six
As another soul passed to the grasping Styx
Clutching their trinket crucifix
Bats blew from eaves in a dissonant surge
Omens of corruption from within the church
A fetid, dank oasis still clung to fool rebirth

Alone as a stone cold altar
The castle and its keep
Like faerytale dominion rose
A widow to the snow peaks
Wherein reclined the Countess
Limbs purring from the kill
Bathed in virgin white and like the night
Alive and young and unfulfilled

Was it the cry of a wolf
That broke the silver thread of enchanted thoughts?
Of Her life as a mere reflection
(As the moon's in narrow windows caught)
That opened like dark eyelids on
The sigh of the woods that the wind fell upon

Like a Siren weaving song
From the lilt of choirs choking
Where the vengeful dead
Belong...

To the Sorceress and Her charnel arts
She swept from ebon towers at the hour of Mars
'Neath a star-inwoven sky latticed by scars
To unbind knotted reins that kept in canter, despair
Shod on melancholy, fleet to sanctuary there,
In netherglades tethered where onyx idols stared

Was it the Kiss of the mist
That peopled the air with the prowess of absinthe?
Lost souls begging resurrection
From Gods upon their forest plinths
Whose epitaphs read of re-ascending to win
Remission from despair through a holocaust of sin

In a tongue hilted in invective rectums
Over signs and seals the sorceress prayed
To Death, to rend the slender veil
That Ancient Ones might rise again

As shadows swelled
The Countess fell
To masturbating with Her dagger
As the Witch gabbled spells
Cumming heavy roses all the way to Hell
As sudden thunder's grue harangue
Announced two pincered worlds

Exuding bane, something came
With the stench of necrophiled graves
To these clandestines
Who shrank from glimpsing horror
That the growls of mating houls inclined...

Resplendent
In pendants
(Natal trophies torn from bellies of desanctified nuns)
A demons, bewinged, bedight
In scum, prowled their circle seeking entry to run
An arctic tongue upon Her vulva
Where rubies smeared to alabaster thighs
Glittered like a contract in the purse of a whore
Receiving sole communion from the body of christ

"If blood is what thou carves, foul fiend
I will yield this witch to thee
If thou wouldst draw a veil for Me
O'er lengthening scars of age and grief"

As the Demon slavered foetid vows
And bore His prey away
In talons itching to perpetrate
The nausea of eternal rape
The Sorceress screaming in His grasp
Spat a final curse to stain
The Countess with the promise
That Her lord at war would be cruelly slain

And She would rot.
Alone
Insane.
On the twisted nails of faith.


8. Bathory Aria

Snuffed tapers sighed
As Death left impressing
His crest of cold tears on the Countess

Benighted like ill-fated Usher
The House of Bathory shrouded
'Neath griefs dark facade

If only I could have wept
In mourning by Her side
I would have clasped Her so tight
Like storm-beached Aphrodite
Drowned on Kytherean tides

And Kissed Her
For from Her alone
My lips would have known
Enigmas of shadowy vistas

Where pleasures took flesh
And pain, remorseless
Came freezing the breath
Of raucous life hushed unto whispers

Benighted.

Inhaling the pale waning moonlight that crept
Through the crypt of Her Lord who so lucidly slept

Benighted.

Exhaling the wail of black widowhood's toll
Waxing eternal night entered Her soul

Now haranguing grey skies
With revenge upon life
Gnathic and Sapphic
Needs begged gendercide

Delusions of Grandier denounced the revolt
Of descrying cursed glass, disenchanted in vaults
Encircled by glyphs midst Her sin-sistered cult

With hangman's abandon She plied spiritworlds
To Archangels in bondage
From light to night hurled
Cast down to the earth where torment would unfurl.......

But soon,
Her tarot proved
Hybrid rumours spread like tumours
Would accrue
And blight Her stars
However scarred
To better bitter truths
Of cold bloodbaths

As bodies rose
In rigid droves
To haunt Her from their
Shallow burials imposed
When wolves exhumed
Their carthen wombs
Where heavy frosts had laboured long
To bare their wounds

To the depths of Her soul they pursued
Wielding their poison they flew
Like a murder of ravens in fugue

And knowing their raptures
Would shatter Her dreams
She clawed blackened books for damnation's reprieve
Baneful cawed canons on amassed enemies

So Hallow's Eve
As She received
Like Bellona to the ball
Those enemies
Fell-sisters heaved
Her torturies
Cross stained flagstones
To Her carriage reined to flee

But She knew She must brave the night through
Though fear crept a deathshead o'er the moon
Like a murder of ravens in Fugue

For each masked, jewelled gaze held dread purpose
Horror froze painted eyes to cold stares
And even Her dance
In the vast mirrors cast
Looked the ill of Her future
If fate feasted there....

In an age crucified by the nails of faith
When rank scarecrows of christ blighted lands
An aloof Countess born an obsidian wraith
Dared the abyss knowing well She was damned
Her life whispered grief like a funeral march
Twisted and yearning, obsessed an entranced
With those succumbing to cruelty
Crushed 'neath the gait of Her dance
A whirlwind of fire that swept through the briers
Of sweet rose Her thickets of black thorn had grasped...

She demanded the Heavens and forever to glean
The elixir of Youth from the pure
Whilst Her lesbian fantasies
Reamed to extremes
O'er decades unleashed
Came for blood's silken cure

But Her reign ended swiftly
For Dark Gods dreamt too deep
To heed Her pleas

When Her gaolers were assailed
With condemnations from a priest
Who'd stammered rites
In the dead of night
For maidens staining winding sheets

And She postured proud
When Her crimes were trowelled
And jezebelled to peasant lips
Though She smelt the fires
That licked limbs higher
To the tortured cunts of accomplices

So ends this twisted fable's worth
And though spared the pyre's bite
By dint of nobled bloodlined birth
Her sins (crimes) garnered Her no respite

Forever severed from the thrill of coming night
Where slow Death alone could grant Her flight

"The Spirits have all but fled judgement
I rot, alone, insane,
Where the forest whispers puce laments for me
From amidst the pine and wreathed wolfsbane
Beyond these walls, wherein condemned
To the gloom of an austere tomb
I pace with feral madness sent
Through the pale beams of a guiltless moon
Who, bereft of necrologies, thus
Commands creation over the earth
Whilst I resign my lips to death
A slow cold kiss that chides rebirth
Though one last wish is bequeathed by fate
My beauty shalt wilt, unseen
Save for twin black eyes that shalt come to take
My soul to peace or Hell for company"
My soul to Hell for company

10. Lustmord And Wargasm (The Lick Of Carnivorous Winds)

An Archangel in bondage
Bediademed, souled
With a murder of ravens
But no less Astarte to behold
Abandoned by Heaven
To the dead, dark and past
Cast Her dispersions
On life's brittle glass

And though Her eyes still held fire
As stonewalls caged the beast
'Gainst the lassitudes of Death
She fought but fell to greet
And midst lies in collusion
She was martyred to teach
That "Divinity and Lust
Are forever forbidden to meet"

But I swore that they would
Before the veil could part our embrace
Twixt Her cold, silent hips I kissed
And promised Christendom in flames

Gravid with madness
Like a feculent dirge
That obsesses the heart
I am covened by words

To avenge Her
Ebon splendour
And surrender
My soul to the dead to achieve
Prophecies of libidinous scourge
Horripilation braying o'er carious herds

Vexing nightmares
And their weak prayers
To a no one there
To hinder Her decree

To weed the world of their disease

As shadows unblind mine eyes to see
The meat that is their congregation

How they plead to the skies
But this is mere foreplay to war

Scar-riddled saffron eves bleed like the conjugal
Vestal daughters giving throat to the priest
A psychophant, the despoiler of faith
Now His skinless crucifixion feeds a winged diocese

For Her interred
I tore a battle banner from His hide
Splashed in red goetia
Hues of Hell and deicide
So came the night
Its obsidian light
Is a master whom disasters
Suck upon like concubines
And under black skirts
That whisper of delight
Darkseeds near fruition
Darked deeds to marry mine

"In Death's bed I have lain
Paying lip-service to shame
But for dreaming of thee I regain
A reason to seek life again"

Then we smite the divine
For our true nature is sin
To strip tender flesh from these swine
Like the lick of carnivorous winds

The breath of the storm that begins
By forcing its Herod tongue in
The womb of the holy virgin
To taste of immaculate sin

From temptation's peak we will see
The world unfurled at last
Now the wolves of time who stalk Mankind
Shall be as one in grim repast

Commemorating sickle moons
The pack are poised to reap
A scythe of white roses in bloom
Whose twisted thorns will keep
A crown upon a dead man
Daylights crucified in sleep
And lives that hide in scriptured lies
To the memories of a scream

And we shall dance amid the ruin
As Adam and Evil
Dizzy at the falling stars
That burn fiercer in throes of upheaval

If all must we damn for this moment
Then it shall be so
For our souls have crossed oceans of time
To clasp one another more tightly
Than Death could alone...

As Zyklon beats reign to make carrion crawl
The talons of lust rake a clarion call
To the lick of carnivorous winds

13. Hallowed Be Thy Name (Shallow Be Thy Grave)

I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life, and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to The Gallow's Pole
The sands of time for me are running low

Motherfuckers!!

Running low!!

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end not some crazy dream?

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not so easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears they flow but why am I crying?
After all I am not afraid of dying
Don't believe that there never is an end

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Someone cries from a cell "God be with you"
If there's a God then why has he let me die?

As I walk all my life drifts before me
Though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul it's willing to fly away

Mark my words believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to see the truth

When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down there is just a strange illusion.

Oh, hallowed be thy name
Oh, hallowed be thy
Name

Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
No


14. Sodomy And Lust

Behind the scene of destiny
I adore you in this song for me
Call me within your holy house to dwell
Let me raise for myself in spell
Voluptuously dancing daughters of the night sky
Sing the rapturous love song with high
Let your sweet scented juice run
Waste away under the lashes of my whip

Bath in sin / Sadistic Souls
Break their crust / Sodomy and Lust

Carnal desire runs through my veins
Whipping boys and scapegoats cry in pain
Psychopathic terror during their sleep
My power ask why, my power is weak
Spineless bundles of my excess
Expurse of innocence and helplessness
In the perfumes of my secret orison
Fresh blood of children drops down on me

Bath in sin / Sadistic Souls
Break their crust / Sodomy and Lust

Madness, crime, disgrace, ptomaine
Excrements, contempt, violence, kill

Ordeals of thousand deeds congealed in gloom
Strike hard and deep, to hell with 'em master
Mighty prophets stature shall surpass the stars
The passion is the smell of cremation
I spit on your crapulous creed, curse 'em!
Sucking you giveth delight and bright glory
Strive ever to be more joyous to the death
Don't fear any god will deny you for this

Bath in sin / Sadistic Souls
Break their crust / Sodomy and Lust

1. From The Cradle To Enslave

Two thousand fattened years like maniacs
Have despoiled our common grave
Now what necrophagous Second Coming backs
From the cradle to enslave?

Sickle constellations
Stud the belts that welt the sky
Whilst the bitter winter moon
Prowls the cloud, dead-eyed
Like shifting parent flesh
Under silk matricide...

Watchful as she was upon Eden
Where every rose arbour and orchard she swept
Hid the hissing of a serpent Libido
In an ancient tryst with catastrophe
Soon the be kept

Hear that hissing now on the breeze
As through the plundered groves of the carnal garden
A fresh horror blows but ten billion souls
Are blind to see the rotting wood for the trees

This is the theme to a better Armageddon
Nightchords rake the heavens
PAN DAEMON AEAON

And what use are prayers to that god?
As devils bay concensus for the space to piss
On your smouldering faith
And the mouldering face
Of this world long a paradise lost

This is the end of everything
Hear the growing chora that a new dawn shall bring

Danse macabre 'neath the tilt of the zodiac
Now brighter stars shall reflect on our fate
What sick nativities will be freed when those lights burn black?
The darkside of the mirror always threw our malice back...

I see the serpentine in your eyes
The nature of the beast as revelations arrive

Our screams shall trail to Angels
For those damned in flames repay
All sinners lose their lot on Judgement Day
We should have cut our looses as at Calvary
But our hearts like heavy crosses held the vain belief
Salvation, like a promised nation
Gleamed a claim away...

This is the end of everything you have ever known
Buried like vanquished reason
Death is season
Drive like the drifting snow
Peace, a fragile lover, left us fantasising war
On our knees or another f**ker's shore
Heiling new flesh
Read, then roared
To a crooked cross and a Holy Cause
What else be whipped to frenzy for?

This is the end of everything
Rear the tragedies
That the Seraphim shall sing

Old adversaries
Next to Eve
Now they're clawing back
I smell their cumming
As through webbed panes of meat
Led by hoary Death
They never left
Dreaming sodomies
To impress on human failure
When we've bled upon our knees

Tablatures of gravel law
Shall see Gehennah paved
When empires fall
And nightmares crawl
From the cradle to enslave....

This is the end of everything


2. Of Dark Blood And Fucking

Sister midnight comes blaspheming
Screaming in the keys of faith and fear
Unentwining our spines twists me to kneeling...
Spilling like the moonlight on her glistening rear

Defiled at heart
In this perfect hell
Under red leaves bleeding
Over scaled chateau we fell
To demonocracy
Where neither Adam or Eve
Conceived of such iniquities
From pleasure or pain
Or the razor's edge inbetween
Thou art my seventh heaven burning
Going down as with the sun...

Within like a river fluids moves a torrent
Bound to please
On denierred knees
In any wicked way
That her whims may warrant

I hang on every verb
Every dirty word
Interred
In her pornoglossa...

Christlike, whipped and weak
Painted nails driven through the meek
Yet in obituary
My dreams still weep
Of dark blood and f**king thee

Thou art seventh heaven burning
Going down as with the day
Baring lunar curvature
Like canvas for a lick of pain

Writhing like a viper
Deep inside her Eden
Forbidden to eat
I kiss leylines to her feet
Then baiting wrath
I steal a path
Back to the fruits of her womb

Back to the crack of her tomb...

Her roseate sliver
Quivers with snuff appeal
The torque of her hips
Lip-sync me in for the kill
Tongue-tied, tightrope and spread like disease
I drain the cup of this Miss Sire
Her water into wine for me

Thou art my seventh angel squirming
'Neath the forked tongue of the beast
Arching toward the fabled
Like a sculptured nymph seeking base relief...

Whilst the world outside
(A wood of suicide)
Would die for this release
Our slow orgasmic fuses greet...

By night and by candle
At each other's throat
In a slick drift of red
Setting god's teeth on edge
We were as wolves preying inside the fold
Of a slaughtered lamb throw
On a four poster bed...

Succulent, Succubus

Laid without rest
In the dead of the night
Succulent, Succubus

In thy arms
And thy wetness
On glossed lips I taste
Conspiracies, secrecies, sorceries laced
With thick unguent rum
Black-rayed suns and Autumn
Always in season for our nightfall from grace

Gorge upon my seed
Starved Persephone
Succulent, Succubus
Succour me.
That I might keep
Thee with me in Hades
Succulent, Succubus
Succour me

3. Death Comes Ripping

Turn the lights down low
And close the door, oh
Future is coming
Future risin'

Shotgun blast, a demon piece of lead

With both eyes open
I wait up for the kill
Feel the evil
Feel the heat as I blast you open

Death comes ripping
And it's going, death comes ripping
You feel the heat as death comes ripping
Rip your back out
And death comes ripping out

Flesh and blood
To weak for you
Turnin' it over
A little too late to penetrate

Death comes ripping
And it's going death comes ripping
You feel the heat as death comes ripping
It'll rip your back out
Death comes ripping

And it's going, death comes ripping
You feel the heat as death comes ripping
You rip your back out
Death comes ripping

And it goes, death comes ripping out


4. Sleepless

And I often sigh
I often wonder why
I'm still here and I still cry

And I often cry
I often spill a tear
Over those not here
But still they are so near

Please ease my burden
And I still remember
A memory and I weep
In my broken sleep
The scars they cut so deep

Please ease my burden
Please ease my pain

Surely without war there would be no loss
Hence no mourning, no grief, no pain, no misery
No sleepless nights missing the dead... Oh, no more
No more war

5. Perverts Church (From The Cradle To Deprave)

6. Funeral In Carpathia (Be Quick Or Be Dead Version)

Candelabra snuffed prey - silhouette wedded
Nightfall take my hand
Seduce me with silky timbred limbs
Grant me thy dark command
Over the peaks framing tapestries
Of thick forest, dusk has filled
With Lucifugous kisses enwreathed in mist
Creeping like violations from the shadows to kill

Lucretia
is my love in vein
When thy tears bleed sweeter
Thank the midsummer rain?
Bewinged, infested belfries
Toll o'er the sobbing throng
A writhe of lethargic, terrored nudes
Whipped and welted neath the barbed windsong...

(in saddean paradise
Ancestral legacies linger on....)

I am He
The crowned and conquering darkness
Satan robed in ecumenical filth
Livid Bacchus sustained by bridal echelons of sylph

This wintry eve when the snow glistens deep
And sharpened turrets wed the jewelless skies
I shrug off the shroud of preternatural sleep
Enbroided by these words Malaresia scribed...

"Beauty slept and angels wept
For Her immortal soul
In this response, all evil chose
To claim her for their very own"

Carpathia
The pleasured dead speak of her
In necromantic tongue
When ambered daylights are done

Masterbating in their graves
On her zenith to come...

This catafalque night when awed stars report
Their absence from the heavenly brow
Crippled seraph shalt cower in illustrious courts
Whilsts the cloaked maelstrom resounds throughout

"How the storm it fulfills
My heart though unhealed
Celestial knifes ebonied
And wild woods thrill
Yet far fiercer still
Her lustre eviscerates me"

Carpathia
Priapic lovers twist in concert with Her
Covenants are struck, jagged lightning fellates
The path towards the castle weary innocence takes

I rule as Master here
Where feral hordes impart my temper
Love sank wounded when I, betrayed
saw death etch cruelly, upon my lineage

"Usher the spite seething Draconist
And commit this world to thy ancient
sovereignty"

Erunescent veil descend
Psalmed sunset thus portends
And laid to rest, I now am blessed
With this darkness... Forever more

Supreme Vampiric Evil


7. Dawn Of Eternity

Winter ice - Terminal frost
Closing eyes of the equinox
Dimensional change - darkening skies
The sphere is shackled till dusk

Prophet dreams - ride the winds
As black holes open for devouring
Universal chaos in the realm of time
Surface of earth - covered in rime

From beyond enter the horror
Of a dark and hideous nature
The fall of man is now at hand
Awakened from an ancient slumber
The immortal ones return
The earth is theirs once again

Stricken, cursed - frozen damnation
Man's fall to perpetual domination
Time trapped in between changes
Frigid return to the chamber of ages

1. At The Gates Of Midian


2. Cthulhu Dawn

Cthulhu dawn

Spatter the stars
Douse their luminosity
With our amniotic retch
Promulgating the birth
Of another Hell on Earth
Shadows gather poisoned henna for the flesh
A necrotic cattle brand
The hissing downfall pentagram
Carven deep upon the church doors of the damned
But no Passover is planned
A great renewal growls at hand
And only when they're running
Will they come to understand...

So ends the pitiful reign of Man

When the moon exhales
Behind a veil
Of widowhood and clouds
On a Biblical scale
We raise the stakes
To silhouette the impaled
Crowds...

Within this kissed disembowel arena
A broken seal on an ancient curse
Unleashes beasts from the seismic breach
With lightning reach and genocidal thirst
Mountains of archaos theories
In collision as at planetary dawn
Apocalypse's razorbacks
Beat wings on glass as thunder cracks
Unfurled across a world hurled to the black

Cthulhu dawn

Shatter the glass house
Wherein spirits breathe out
Halitosis of the soul
From a recking abscess
Plague of far righteousness
All fates hang in the balance
Mocking crucified dolls
An inquisition outs
When the Sun goes out our powers
Will extend throughout Heaven like Asphodel
As they have for countless lustrum
In dark Midian accustoned
To burning effigies of our enemies well

So begins the sibilant world Death knell...

When a corpse wind howls
And awakes from drowse
The scheming dead freed
Of gossamer shrouds
We gorgonise eyes
Of the storm aroused
Red...

Blinding time
All lines dine on this instance
A melting spool of beggar, negative frames
The skies teem alive, to watch die
Mankind hauled to fable in vast tenement graves...

Cthulhu dawn


3. Saffron's Curse

Through arcades where shimmering snowfall
Lay in state with the sad and damned
A rent lament barely flung above a whisper
Drew Me like a ghost to the haunts of Man

I Found Her tempting fate between Her wrist and razor
A kindred spirit in a graveyard
Beneath the stature of a colder saviour
Mist hung like thieves wreathed in scant arabesques
And through the chill earth it bedwed Her drawling breast
Like a come dream true under etched glass spent
Making love to the beautiful dead

She has sinned and severed Heaven
And in its vulgar sight
Two figures writhe, but one silhouette
Extends its fingers to the light

"Gothic towers tottered on my heels
As I fled asylum grounds
Committing hard crimes to soft cells
Where now another's screams resound."

From the gaspings in Her passing
Six feet under or beneath frayed gown
When Her hands pointed to midnight
In a white stained chamber bound

I Swept Her from the abyss of another dementia
Freeing Her soul from the fetters of fate
To take the reins of pleasure
Now nightwane mirrors freeze in seizure
At the glimpse of charmed pins in Her thighs
Ballrooms filled with black cats scratch
Out of spite and playful eyes

Pricked as a Witch Her stitches itch
For familiar lips to lick them dry
Whilst the dark regrasps, for if She asks
The Sun forsakes the rite to rise
And is the first to discern, that this Angel's return
Is a vengeful call on grace
For even martyrdom backs from its suicide pacts
A leap of twisted fate betrayed...

The scars will last until the stars
Caught in Her train bewitched
Fall into line and yield the sign
That Dawn in born to their eclipse

For Our Inhumankind
Comes an underdog day Sunrise
Rippling with fire like femaledition

Wind amidst the flame
I gazed out
Tapped into the fog and shared her pain
When in her mind she sought his leave
And begged forgiveness

I splintered Her coffin and lay on the floor
Of a vault with Her clasped as the moon hugs the shore
What treachery this that She breathed no more?
Christ you bastard!

I wished Her back but the dead adored Her
Even wild winds sang in chora for Her
Saffron from my heart, from the start I swore
We'd be together more...

Creation froze with the triumph of Death
But still She stirred and awoke bereft
Of concern save for the aeons left
To lead the darkness...

She schemes of growing power and the lengths sucked hard to get it
I dream of being God but ever living to regret it
Our fecund nature decrees that Jesus wept come for
The Devil on Her knees

To grant Her lows a remedy
And mine desire's wish
To taste thereof of Heaven's scent
As sick and twisted as it is
For Her corset laced with arsenic
Hides snake curves within Her midst
Whilst Her halo of white lies supplies
Her temple to what God forbids.


4. Death Magick For Adepts

Come distortured artists
Bitter things seek meaning
Even if they're madness to behold
Once forbears to horizons
Where the dead stayed dreaming
Now nightmares waken souls
That fear the living's toll

Gova, Bosch and Brueghel
Three times moonwise stain thy graves
For words alone are at loss to trace
The face of today's inhuman wraith

One half adrift in the vast abyss
Of despair and misery
The other a mask of rich red lips
Whetted by the fevers of belief and greed

All damned in this inferno
Where even Virgil averts His eyes
From the black mass mutual gang rape
Of Caesing hands an forced divides

Trespass these seven gates
To a world bloodlet to shades
Where Seraphim
(Falling on deaf ears) bleat
Of their cold and coming Master's race
In the seweres of Babylon
Stillborn to a trough anon
Chimiracles will hatch like plots
To dredge faces to pearl their cross

Enter Penteholocaust!
Five Aeons past, yet still Man grasps
At final straws to save his cast

His Lord is a leper we shall not want
He betrayed us with white lies
His acrid pall as of the tomb
Reminds us how we rot inside

Gutted like fool's paradise
Glutted on cruel appetites...

Holding court to chaos
Folding to far graver arms
A downfall fatal to all resounds
As orgies peak in self centred psalms

And Nature screams Her sufferings
Under bowed and cankered wings
A bleak scorched Earth necrotica burning
Like the robes we've torn from Her

She begs Us lay Her pain to rest
Lest We are left with nothingness
Save for Her stripped and ravished flesh

And if Her fate is not portent of Apocalypse
Then the comets that graze night skies
Will surely cleanse of wrongs and reichs
When you and I and all else dies...

It's rotting down
This carcass Maggotropolis

Interdependent as worms to the grave
Allah's true name is naught
Chist acannot save
Locked in a waltz of evermore frantic steps
Spells of regret...
Death Magick for Adepts

Be prepared to fulfill prophecies
The glorious fall of a sin dynasty

Gutted like fool's paradise
Glutted on cruel appeitites...

"We've woven hearts a thorn arbour
Left tear streaked reason upon the shore
And bereft of compass, star or more
Set out for this World's end
Few at the prow, most slave below
Painting coal a perfect gold
But for all it's worth, the engines slow
Dead in the brine again
Come cabin fever, sodomy on the bounty
Prey to phallus seas
That hiss and foam to douse disease
A storm roars on the way
Blacker than the Ace of Rapes
Dealt out by Death in darkwood glades
Our Ship of Fools, all boards handmade
Sinks, dashed by seismic waves..."


5. Lord Abortion

"Care for a little necrophilia? Hmm?"

I was born with a birthmark of cinders
Debris cast from the stars and Mother
A ring of bright slaughter, I spat in the waters
Of life that ran slick from the stabwounds in Her

Dub Me Lord Abortion, the living dead
The bonesaw on the backseat
On this bitter night of giving head
A sharp rear entry, an exit in red
Lump in the throat, on my come choke
The killing joke worn thin with breath

I grew up on the sluts bastard Father beat blue
Keepsake cunts cut full out easing puberty through

Aah! Nostalgia grows
Now times nine or ten
Within this vice den called a soul
Dying resurrection
I dig deep to come again
The spasm of orgasm on a roll...

I live the slow serrated rape
The bucks fizz of amyl nitrate
Victims force fed their own face
Tear stains upon the drape
I should compare them
To a warm Summer's day
But to the letter, it is better
To lichen their names to a grave

Counting My years on an abacus strung
With labial rings and heartstrings undone

Dub Me Lord Abortion, the living dead
The bonesaw on the backseat
On this bitter night of giving head
A sharp rear entry, an exit in red
Lump in the throat, on My come choke
The killing joke worn thin with breath

Horrorscopes My diorama
A twelve part (so far) psychodrama
Another chained I mean to harm Her
Inside as well as out
A perverts gasp inside the mask
I'm hard, blow My house of cards
All turn up Death, Her bleeding starts
In brute vermilion parts...

Now I slither through the hairline cracks
In sanity, best watch your back

Possessed with levering Hell's gates wide
Liberating knives to cut Humanity slack

My ambition is to slay anon
A sinner in the hands of a dirty God
Who lets Me prey, a Gilles De Rais
Of light where faith leads truth astray

I slit guts guts and free the moistest faces
Corrupt the corpse and seize the choicest pieces
Her alabaster limbs that dim the lit carnal grin
Vaginal skin to later taste and masturbate within

"My heart was a wardrum beat
By jugular cults in eerie jungle vaults
When number thirteen fell in My lap
Lips and skin like sin, a Venus Mantrap
My appetite whetted, storm crows wheeled
At the blurred edges or reason 'til I was fulfilled
Whors d'oeuvres eaten, I tucked Her into
A grave coffin fit for the Queen of Spades
She went out like the light in My mind
Her face an avalanche of pearl, of ruby wine...
Much was a flux, but the mouth once good for fucks
Came from retirement to prove She had not lost Her touch
I kissed Her viciously, maliciously, religiously
But when has ONE been able TO best separate the THREE?
I know I'm sick as Dahmer did, but this is what I do
Aah, aah, ahh, I'll let you sleep when I am through..."

"You Fucking Whore!"

The suspect shadow sher they least
Expect My burning grasp to reach

The stranglehold, the opened arms
Seeking sweet meat with no holes barred

Rainbows that My razors wrung
Midst Her screams and seams undone
Sung at the top of punctured lungs
I bite My spiteful tongue
Lest curses spat from primal lairs
Freeze romance where Angels, bare
Are lost to love, bloodloss, despair
I weep, they merely stare...
And stare, and stare, and stare, and stare.


6. Amor E Morte

Her bouquets are wilted
Too long has She slept
Their cruel red mouths darkened
To bowed silhouettes
I saw in a new moon
With Her scent on my breath
But then all to soon
Came the hunger for flesh

I held Her in eyes like necropoli
Laying Her on a tomb with a view
Lighting Her from Her feet
To the stars in Her hair
Drove sweet blood to Her throat
And My lips parted there

(In the tone of splintered bone)
She screams benighted
My limbs ignite
A carnal carnivore
On all fours to go...

An ebon Nemesis
From torture gardens of Dis
Having never breathed an Eve
As far narcotic as this
Two spellbound hellhounds
Hearts pounding loud
Racing Heaven out of focus
Under quicksilver clouds

"God is maimed come let us prey..."
To lunar deities that pave deadways
Twixt the living and the grave
Amor e Morte
To cast our feral shadows there
We made Love bleed on a Deathbed shared
Where, begging Me to feed
To best be Were...

I licked Her wounds and ate Her rare

Argentinum spurred
Her wanton words incurred
A sin ridden tongue
To open trading in fur
Never were those gates of pearl
So rubbed to their cusp
Never were the Worlds above
So bitten with the bestial...

Seraphim fell like guillotines
Giving gracious head

Instead of harking prophecies
And how our brother sang
Amor e Morte
In the thick evergreens
Theirs was a chorus for raucous souls
Shifting shape and lifting napes
To commemorate
Erotic stains
Amor e Morte

Unfasten thy masque
Come sky-clad to my arms
Leave thy gown a dark pool at thy feet
I yearn musky valleys that no Man hath seen
The chill keen of stars
Over Yew and deep wooded ravines
A hidden meridian
Where Midian may be...

In black antlered glades
Encunted in this forest Goddess
She whispers My name
I buck under flames
Animal nitrates
Howling through my veins

I ride riptides that wrest and writhe to the fore
New lusts eclipsing lips
That brought me to this verge of War
With inner beasts unleashed
To feast, fuck and run
Rampart in chase of She wolf pacts
Forged on heat with setting Suns

I love the night
It would murder My soul
Should I ever fall blind
For though thy flesh haunts
I keep also in mind
The stampede of clouds
From Dusk's predatory sky

Purple versed like the funeral hearse
That first turned thee over to My...
Unbridled kiss when I found thee in mist
Dressed for the sepulchre
My Demon bride...

"God is maimed come let Us prey..."
To Lunar Deities that pave deadways
Twixt the living and the grave
Amor e Morte
Ours was a chorus for raucous souls
Shifting shape and lifting nape
To commemorate
Erotic stains

Amor e Morte
Amor e Morte


7. Creatures That Kissed In Cold Mirrors


8. Her Ghost In The Fog

"The Moon, she hangs like a cruel portrait
Soft winds whisper the bidding of trees
As this tragedy starts with a shattered glass heart
And the Midnightmare trampling of dreams
But oh, no tears please
Fear and pain may accompany Death
But it is desire that shepherds it's certainty
As We shall see..."

She was divinity's creature
That kissed the cold mirrors
A Queen of Snows
Far beyond compare
Lips attuned to symmetry
Sought Her everywhere
Dark liqoured eyes
An Arabian nightmare...

She shone on watercolours
Of my pondlife as pearl
Until those who couldn't have Her
Cut Her free of this World

That fateful Eve when...
The trees stank of sunset and camphor
Their lanterns chased phantoms and threw
An inquisitive glance, like the shadows they cast
On my love picking rue by the light of the moon

Putting reason to flight
Or to death as their way
They crept through woods mesmerized
By the taffeta Ley
Of Her hips that held sway
Over all they surveyed
Save a mist on the rise
(A deadly blessing to hide)
Her ghost in the fog

They raped left...
(Five men of God)
...Her ghost in the fog

Dawn discovered Her there
Beneath the Cedar's stare
Silk dress torn, Her raven hair
Flown to gown Her beauty bared
Was starred with frost, I knew Her lost
I wept 'til tears crept back to prayer

She'd sworn Me vows in fragrant blood
"Never to part
Lest jealous Heaven stole our hearts"

Then this I screamed:
"Come back to Me for
I was born in love with thee
So why should fate stand in between?"

And as I drowned Her gentle curves
With dreams unsaid and final words
I espied a gleam trodden to earth
The Church bell tower key...

The village mourned her by the by
For She'd been a witch
Their Men had longed to try
And I broke under Christ seeking guilty signs
My tortured soul on ice

A Queen of snow
Far beyond compare
Lips attuned to symmetry
Sought Her everywhere
Trappistine eyes
An Arabian nightmare...

She was Ersulie possessed
Of a milky white skin
My porcelain Yin
A graceful Angel of Sin

And so for Her...
The breeze stank of sunset and camphor
My lantern chased Her phantom and blew
Their Chapel ablaze and all locked in to a pain
Best reserved for judgement that their bible construed...

Putting reason to flight
Or to flame unashamed
I swept form cries
Mesmerized
By the taffeta Ley
Or Her hips that held sway
Over all those at bay
Save a mist on the rise
A final blessing to hide
Her ghost in the fog

And I embraced
Where lovers rot...
Her ghost in the fog

Her ghost in the fog


9. Satanic Mantra

"Archangel, Dark Angel
Lend me thy light
Through Death's veil
'Til we have Heaven in sight!"


10. Tearing The Veil From Grace

Biblical choirs soar beyond veiled light
A swan song for ravens trapped flapping in night

A tragic yet magical fall from grace
Too awful to taste for the led and the chaste
Those whose long fetters are addressed to all saints

Free shining souls torn from God's given Reich
Defiled, reviled, exiled from sight

And Hell knows we sought victory
Chancing the leash
But when bad die were cast
We were cast down to die
A steeple of needles thrust into our eyes
So scholars might say we were blinded by pride
Like the sin of Our Father (and the whims of our kind)
Whom in Isaiah and Midian thrived
Regaining His sights for the storming of skies...

And after descenturies have crawled, vilified
Our dark harkened day on spread wing now arrives

For eternity is a coprophagic
Backward figure head
Gorging on Her own bitter end
And We have eaten shit
Until we're close to addicts
Now grime is running out
For us to make amends

To retake what once was lost
To exalt our throne above the stars of God

"To throw our fuck into gates and guts
Of a severed never land
Where we, the damned
Once pleasured ran
Like seamen from the phallus sea"

Atrocious oceans must be crossed
To exalt our throne above the stars of God

The thirteenth sign of the Zodiac climbs
Cowled and scythed to snuff the sunrise...

Throwing shades of war before like prophecy
Night breed freed from the vasty deep
...Nasty reap of freaks forsaken
And when sultry Dusk disrobes they'll learn
She is not a natural blond
For the lower She goes the darker it grows
An Eve that blows on Her knees for Satan

Fellated Satan
Screams congeal in clotted pearl
As He unfurls from aching hibernation

Stormbringer drums thunder to full Dis orchestra
As lighting streaks with fire
Black clouds that shroud the Earth
Whose cold breasts have held us in scar pillories
But now the Sun is loath to come
The crescent moon is freed...

Elated Satan
The scimitar slash to the under gash
Of Heaven too slight for penetration

We strike as wolves from the thickening fog
To exalt our throne over the stars of God
Lowly holy goats bare the brunt
Of rabid dogmas on a stellar bearhunt
Bastioned in citadels and monastic cells
That smell of blessed cunt
Like a convent where crosses rust
From thirty dirty habits of shaved nun
There where deeper needs are begged of lust
And cess and less impress enough

Obtaining the ord of Our Guardian, Anger
And Death's tunnel vision
Bad thing in collision
The locking of eyes and jagged antler

Unpicking the seams of fate sewn over dreams
Feasting from throats of celestial thieves

And God knows we seek victory
Now that we are unleashed
To drive nails home of blind faith through those
Who drove us from error to terror below
Refugees clung to a crown furred in flies
Tarred with red honey, the plaster
Of many a spire that aspired to rise
Seeking Messiahs that by us soon die...

In the start like a cast
In morality plays
Our hearts wore a mask
Of dead rooks in the rain
The World was our cloister
No prayer, bent in shame
Our once lucent plumage
Stung with horn withered grey...
And away...
As Aeons slew so we grew to myth
Revenge accrued to a monolith
Bursting through from our roofed abyss
Like an aether greased fist
Now vulvite gates are so sorely missed
Our horror pours through the orifice
Where once the spheres and archangels kissed
Phallelujah!

Fellated Satan
His coming assails
The Night In Gales
That bewail turned tides
That engulf their nation

Now divinity is a worm ridden mouth
In a darkened high house
Overrun by disease
So let the truth be wrung
That the Banished Ones intent
On reinstatement have won

We breathe by virtue of their rot
Now our souls exult above the stars of God

11. Tortured Soul Asylum

"Oh, sweet Midian,
I burn for thee at heart.
Don't despair me.
Come bare me on wings of graveyard robbed leather
To where pleasure rings deep secrets
In spurts, after dark..."

Under full moons waxing lyrically:
Death's poetry floods the soul,
Like the freezing seed of a demon freed
To curse the stars with vertigo.
And in their dance, in trance I've prised wide
Slick rifts twixt obsidian thighs,
Hymeneal gates to darker sides.
A glimpse of plinths where Midian lies.

Midian...

Haunted by this portent,
This obsession in my mind.
With a city sunk below,
Tall cedar groves and graves sublime
Sporting their importance,
Marble wings spread to the skies.
A vale of dreams that it would seem,
The daylights race to leave behind.

These visions struck like a furious fuck
Nailing wet lips to cold cemetery walls.
Flashes of lust to dust
Splashed across my psychic pall,
As hybrid lovers reached their cusp
With final thrusts I saw it all.

Forbidden Midian,
A long fabled Judecca.
A sanctuary for sin...

You rival Heaven
Above Heaven's tragic wreck
(Though the only Angels in repose
Were those with ivy strangled necks)
Small mercies in vistas of dolmen and vault.
Gaunt, haunched edifices
Midst lightfingered mists,
From whence more awful shadows
Drew back rusted bolts
And dared a threshold.
The searing Sun had knelt to kiss.

Shades of dusk, cruelty and myth,
The Tribes of Christ will not forgive -
And shall not suffer their kind to live!

For I, mesmerized, started not from tombs,
Or their waltz so sibilant
Through the gathering gloom!
But from flumes of the moon in bloom,
Baring each a face effaced,
And raped in the womb!

In hidden Midian,
A Vatican lying in state,
For the sanctity of sin...

To rival Heaven
Free of Heaven's tragic wreck
(Though the only Angels that arose
Were those who fell to most requests)
Small mercies in vistas where dolmen and vault
Caught twisted whispers where fisted sisters
Haunched, flaunted orifice
Midst lighter fingered mists.
Whilst I watched without revolt,
Carnalities few beasts permit.

Between the dog and wolf,
Bared fangs met in intercourse.
A nightly rite of teeth and cunt,
For those below who rose to hunt.

Soar sights that preyed on Me for days,
And in laudenum's haze
I painted them all...

The slew of sith and kin
I drew in blood, my veins in thrall
To Deathugees at peace within
Grotesques and wolves in women's skins
The raven winged and missing limb
Suicides and split thighed Seraphim.

And marble stairs
Stargrazers dare
Ascend like prayer
(As smoke or ghost or lithe nightmares)

Under full moons waxing lyrically:
Death's poetry floods the soul,
Like the freezing seed of a demon freed
To curse the star with vertigo.
And in their dance, in trance I've prised wide
Slick rifts twixt obsidian thighs,
Hymeneal gates to other sides.
A labyrinth wherein Midian hides

Midian...

I know I've seen
Through the black backed mirrors in sanity:
Lucent prides amassed in last retreat,
Prurient souls but no more freaks
Than those leashing dreams at harm's length from Me.
And just like grim ascension prophecies,
My revenge, carved deep, will be
A grisly plot that reads,
Like my filthy white ward spattered with their screams.

When My Deviliverers come from fog for Me...

... Please come for me...

Exhuming the moon,
Through the bars in My room.
The sooner the bitter pills swallowed are through.
But no Genotypes, Aphrodites, Demon archetypes,
No Cenobites rise to clame me from you!

No! No! No!
Don't leave here in this storm weathered cell!
No! No! No!
With prophets and losses,
And dead men from crosses,
My fate is a preview of derelict Hell!

Midian!
Midian!


12. For Those Who Died

Our tongues they could not silence with their malicious lies,
Their unforgotten violence, remember those who died.

And as my flesh is put to fire I hear their voices still,
Their unjust accusations demanding I am killed.

"We shall show no mercy to heathen such as thee,
Who stand accused and have refused the Church's clemency,
Your wicked acts are endless through the crimes we cannot name,
Innocent or guilty proved, we'll burn you just the same."

Burning, into the fire.
Burning, a funeral pyre.
Burning, into the fire.
Burning, a funeral pyre.

This self-righteous inquisition is a plague upon our land,
As false as the confessions they force from shattered hands.

"We shall show no mercy to heathen such as thee,
Who stand accused and have refused the Church's clemency,
Your wicked acts are endless through the crimes we cannot name,
Innocent or guilty proved, we'll burn you just the same."

Burning, into the fire.
Burning, a funeral pyre.
Burning, into the fire.
Burning, a funeral pyre.

Abused my broken body is cleansed by righteous flame,
Their God a 'God of Mercy' yet in whose name I slain.

My innocence the victim of their superstitious fears,
Religious persecution for the past three hundred years.
Preaching peace and mercy 'neath the shadow of the knife,
A papal reign of terror, slaughter in the name of Christ.

And as my flesh is put to fire I hear their voices still,
Their unjust accusations demanding I am killed.

"We shall show no mercy to heathen such as thee,
Who stand accused and have refused the Church's clemency,
Your wicked acts are endless through the crimes we cannot name,
Innocent or guilty proved, we'll burn you just the same."

Burning, into the fire.
Burning, a funeral pyre.
Burning, into the fire.
Burning, a funeral pyre.

1. Sin Deep My Wicked Angel



2. All Hope In Eclipse

A thousand nights once succoured Me
In the shadow of misanthropy
Sat gargoyle-limbed amid My licking flame

A cruel tongue at work in Her secret vaults
Sent Rebellion's embers into revolt
The coming of extinction
Synched to whimpers of my name...

Legion I arose, a flood of inhumanity
An acid reign to purify the world
The Asp at Pharaoh's breast
The Atom split under duress
A sniper at the gates of spattered pearl

My heart, torn apart, left a rifled grave...
Save for an unfurled flag of hate
To enthral a mindless zombie race

All heil, all heil, all heil the serpentine's gift
All heil, love fails, all hope lies in eclipse

Black bibles I inscribed,
The words "Damnation through design"
Seemed a bitter truth far better for the lie
For as hope was felled by reason
Forlorn conquers with the season
And Death was swift to swallow on the hells of life

Lowered souls, growing cold, tentered easy prey
When heaven's flock, a fair game, dropped
I bored of war with God with greater thrones to claim...

All heil, all heil, all heil the Libertine's wish
All heil, love fails, all hope lies in eclipse

Then between the past and the ravening dark
A sly Messiah came
In the thick of treaty with obligatory greed
She stole the soul hate had sold away

An ancient chill blew down the centuries
That night atonement's eyes
Lit a burning man in Me

When love lay bleeding
And Fates sate feeding
From wounds gored 'neath
Those cherubic wings
She of kindred light
Gladly sacrificed
Eternity
Just to be
With Me

As the moon whose silvered fingers play
On words and dreams too cursed for day
She led my hand to lands I'd not accrued
Where the Faun Dawn bathed Her golden hair
And faith renewed, leaped joyous there
I praised their worth, then planned their conquest too...

All heil, all heil, all heil the serpentine's gift
All heil, love fails, all hope lies in eclipse

All heil, all heil, all heil the Libertine's wish
All heil, love fails, all hope lies in eclipse
...and ignorance is truly bliss.


3. Born In A Burial Gown

Sibilant and macabre
Walpurgis sauntered in
Skies litten with five-pointed stars
The work of crafts surpassing sin
As She graced Her window ledge
- An orphaned gypsy nymph
This issue of the forest's bed
Skin flushed with sipped absinthe -
Her eyes revealed, as Brocken's peak
Tried once concealing Hell
A snow white line of divine freaks
In riot, where they fell...

The circus lurches in, a ring of promised delight
For seven days and seven festival nights
What wicked wonders lie within the confines
Of the panther's den

She watches from a maypole, on the rip of Her tongue
The restless spirit of Christmas to come
A Gretel sick of merely sucking Her thumb
Than gingerbread men

Spawned scorned, abhorred by the aerial
She was the light of the world going down
War-torn, forlorn and malarial
She was found
Born in a burial gown

Unloosed, the chain of Her god-given cross
Seduced, now pagan ribbons swathe Her repose
In a carnival of souls sold and similarly lost

Too many decades misfit and mislaid
In innocence, a tender legend of prey
Parades Her second coming, now they're running afraid

Spawned scorned, abhorred by the aerial
She was the light of the world going down
War-torn, forlorn and malarial
She was found
Born in a burial gown

Now She moves with a predator's guile
Beyond the fire-lit circle of life
She soothes your cold heart for a while
Then matches its beat, synching in with a knife
She wrestles Her dreams with a delicate case
Espied by Her cross on the wall
And should She awake, through embrace or mistake
She would take Jesus
Bless foot forward and all...

Sibilant and at last
The circus crawled away
With another lover in its arms
Dancing on Her grave...

4. Summer Dying Fast

Through acrid clouds of summer flies
The garden swells with a thousand more wise
Forever flung to celestial dreams
Clawing at the grave of the dead Nazarene

I watch the storm approaching
The darkness calls my name
The trees are growing restless
They feel the season change
Their fruit has putrified
Forbidden once and bound to die
The thread of life lies severed
On the brink of paradise

Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Dash towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch her veil
Reclamation, our time has come...

Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last...
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies

They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?

Will they know of majesty
Of secrets held in dream-dead sleep
And frozen stars that gild the forest floor?
Will their "god" of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from Chaos roused for war?

WAR!

Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end
"We are what we are, what we shall be, again..."

Appear; draped in terror
To the comfort of your kin
Stain the milky sunset red
And let the others in...

Summer's dying...


5. No Time To Cry


It's just a feeling
I get sometimes
A feeling
Sometimes
And I get frightened
Just like you
I get frightened too
But it's...

(No no no) No time for heartache
(No no no) No time to run and hide
(No no no) No time for breaking down
(No no no) No time to cry

Sometimes in the world as is you've
Got to shake the hand that feeds you
It's just like Adam says
It's not so hard to understand
It's just like always coming down on
Just like Jesus never came and
What did you expect to find
It's just like always here again it's...

Everything will be alright
Everything will turn out fine
Some nights I still can't sleep
And the voices pass with time
And I keep
No time for tears
No time to run and hide
No time to be afraid of fear
I keep no time to cry

6. The Principle Of Evil Made Flesh

From the primeval mass
Let precious chaos vent
Sacred flesh drenched in fornication
Beloved by Set
May the winds gather her together
From the secrets of men
After thousands of years of terrifying silence
She comes again

(All Destroyer)

The abolition of the yeshua begins...

Shattered are the icons of the worthless
The Goddess scorned is a Valkyrie born
Scattered are the wings of the virulent holy
Leave their husks to be the prey of vultures and dogs

World without end
Cherish the lissome wants of pernicious evil
Dusk in her eyes
Torn bloody weeping skies
Darkness will hasten to devour
And the weak will flee or die

Heil Bast, drinker of blood, dancer on flames, disposer of light, lover of darkness.
She's holding an inquisition from the bandaged, feeble one.

I slay the lamb in the fervour of thine
Abandonment unto Our Lady
With a quenchless thirst for the infinite
For Her that exists beyond all knowledge

Storming from tired centuries
Under the glare of a waxing death-moon
Terrible beauty of love severed
Rip the baby from the virginal womb

The blood of Jesus
Is the wine of the dead
And the drunken angels
Bleed with incest

The Liliot suckle on Her fruitful breasts
And yield the swords that sever and stain
There will be no act or passion wrought
That shall not be attributed to Her names

To the name of Baphomet...
Artemis, Bastet, Astarte

I yearn to thee who art darkness in thy rising

7. Suicide And Other Comforts

I pace, alone
In a place for the dead
Overcome by woe
And here, I've grown
So fond of dread
That I swear it's heaven

Oh sweet Mary,
Dressed in grief
Roll back the stone

With these words scrawled in a severed hand
Tears fall like shards of glass that band
In rivers, like sinners
Swept with me to join the damned

A darkened sky
The day that laughter died
Fell swiftly into night
And stayed within Her sight
Staring at the knife
Oh God, how easy now the sacrifice
My life, to have Her with me

So farewell to distant thunder
Those inept stars I've worshipped under
Fall father, their Father
Lies in wait in flames below
Whilst my love, a blood red flower
Calls to me from verdant bowers
Graveside, I cry
Please save me from this Hell I know

A darkened sky
The day that laughter died
Fell swiftly into night
And stayed within Her sight
Staring at the knife
Oh God, how easy now to sacrifice
My life, to have Her with me

An eye for an eye as espied in the bible
My faith is lost to the burning of idols
One less cross to press upon the survival
Of this lorded agony

And I, (much as I have tried
To bury Her from mind,
Fate's tourniquet was tied, when She died...)
Still sense Her presence so divine
Lithe arms about my throat
Like pining swans entwined
Footfalls at nightfall close to mine

Suicide is a tried and tested formula for release

I snatch Her whisper like the wind through cedars
See Her face in every natural feature
Midst the mist and sleepy hollows of fever...
With glee deceiving me

Suicide is a tried and tested formula for release

I hear Her voice from where the grave defies Her
Siren song to sing along, no finer
Suicide notes, harmonised in a minor
Strike a chord with misery

No light nor reef
No unsinkable of romance keeps me
Safely from the stormy seas
Now drowning, resounding
Death-knells pound my dreams
Unthinkable to dredge through this
Listless and lonely winter frieze

A darken sky
This day hereafter dies
Falls swiftly into night
And stays within my sight
Staring at the knife
Oh God, how ease it was to sacrifice
My life, to have Her with me

No more a victim of a crusade
Where souls are strung from a moral palisade
I slit my wrists and quickly slip away...
I journey now on jewelled sands
Beneath a moon to Summerlands
To grace Her lips with contraband
The blaze once in my veins


8. Dinner At Deviant's Palace

Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.


9. The Black Goddess Rises II

Thee I invoke, a bornless one
All woman, pure predator
Wherein conspiracies and impulse dwell
Like a seething fall from grace

Thee I worship...

Thou art darkest Gabrielle
Lilith rode the steed
Thou art pale Hecate
Rising from Thessaly

Crush their unworthy idols
No church shall bar our path
Seductive Evil, drink your fill
Of the bleeding Christ in your arms

Thou art in my dreams
The darkness in my eyes
The rapture in their screams
Black goddess

We bide our hideous soldiers
Inviting esctacy
But though they send the thunder
Bringing their dekind

Thou art in my dreams
The darkness in my eyes
The rapture in their screams
Black goddess

Nothing will keep us apart
We could kill them all
If desire tore free
Our union is one sweet sinful Eve

And the night draws in beside her
As we embrace the dark with designs
And I pour my soul to those eyes of fire
As I bury my seed deep inside

"Archangel, snare the flesh
Suck dry the ebbing wound
Leave them lifeless and broken
My beloved..."

Oh, how I have craved for you
You so pure and other-worldly with your scent of winter
Am I to bleed myself dry just to see your delight?

And the fear retreats forever
When my secrets are wedded with thine
Under seven stars we came together
To plot the new age's decline

Ishtar my Queen
Come forth to me
And help me seize
My future from the House of Death

That in the release of immortality
I should slay their fucking Nazarene

Ah... the lies... the kiss... I kill for you

Thou art in my dreams
The darkness in my eyes
The rapture in their screams
Black Goddess

Hidden lusts will break the gates and swarm
As love secretes the thrill for war
The virgin raped shall seek to whore
She-wolf bare your snarling jaw

Thee I invoke, a bornless one
All woman, pure predator
Wherein conspiracies and impulse dwell
Like a seething fall from grace

Thou art darkest Gabrielle
Lilith rode the steed
Thou art dark Hecate
Rising from Thessaly


10. Scorched Earth Erotica

Sunset, expect
This to be your last with Our vast return
As Death is set
At three sixes where hill beacons burn

Darkness, undress
Your descending skirts yield a thirsting altar
Blood-red, yet still unfed
Lips distend ending, time to falter
(Dominus)

Welcome, arms tied down crucified...
The slaughter

(Dominus)
Lightening freezes seven
(Dominus)
Outtakes from the rape of the world
(Dominus)
Sins expelled from Heaven
Now befoul from the bowels of Hell

Where the tragic in theory and practice fell

Last prayers hang in the air
Each unto their own rag and bonemeal saviours
Strung where crippled vultures dare
Golgotha
Coughs another cross to grave God's failure

(Dominus)
Once the forests spired
(Dominus)
Nurtured in Nature's heart
(Dominus)
Now dreat cedars feed the pyres
Need-fires lit for greater harm

(Dominus)
As Her children toy with razors
(Dominus)
Sightless and deeply scarred
(Dominus)
And the moon arose to phase Her
Cracks a grin so wide it hides the stars

And lights Our path back through the shattered glass

(We come like drumming thunder
Tides enwreathed in scum and plunder
Kraken-teethed to tear asunder
All those too blind to see...)

Where the tragic in theory and practice meet

Deranged, uncaged
We rage like a plague through this age of greed
Sowers of discord, growing wars to reap
A terrible crop to beat a vicious retreat

Scorched Earth, rebirth
Disintered in the writhe of the lone survivor
Whose worth is worse than the curse
Of Sardonicus choking on his own saliva

Who shares the last laugh now
Dead wedded fates fulfil their vows?
Foot in mouth of sacred cows
Face down in dust and poisoned ground...

1. Satyriasis

Glory and praise to thee in all the steeps
Of Heaven where thou didst reign, and in the deeps
Of Hell where fallen thy dream, silently.

2. Gilded Cunt

Your misery is worn as a veil
To hide bewitchment of the ugliest kind
In place of eve a bitter parody hails
Daggers from the swagger
Of a sodomite's concubine
Bine (Bine)

Gilded cunt
Oh, you gilded cunt

Your thin pretence overstretched and sickly
Feigns love and light a long time laid in the grave
My preference leans to killing you quickly
Scissored in the gizzard
That a heart no more maintains

But I am tied
To the labyrinth and the beast
The one-way track of eyes
Black and grey like panzers

Loose your shell
Shoot the mouth
The gates of hell
Have often dropped their jaws about
Satan's agents were perversion to bear
Side to side with their diversions
You use to guide my fingers there

Dirty little gold digger
Dirty little gold digger
Dirty little gold digger
Dirty little gold digger
Dirty little gold digger
Dirty little gold digger

Cunt (Cunt)
Gilded cunt
Oh, you gilded cunt
Cunt
Cunt

Nothing is above you save a boreal light
That halo paid for by a consummated ring of ice
And below you, will I see you tonight
Glower from your tower
Built of ivory and spite?

For I am torn
Between the sheets that keep me borne
And the teeth of a storm
They reap then rape my stanzas

Click your heels
Three times six
The stars are fixed
May I climb and get you one?
The palace at Versailles never held your tongue
Nor did heaven ever weather
The crosses that you came upon

Dirty little soul frigger
Dirty little soul frigger
Dirty little soul frigger
Dirty little soul frigger
Dirty little soul frigger
Dirty little soul frigger

Cunt (Cunt)
Gilded cunt
Oh, you gilded cunt
Cunt
Cunt

Take you pain and shove it up your asshole
Take you pain and shove it up your asshole
Take you pain and shove it up your asshole
Take you pain and shove it up your asshole
Take you pain and shove it up your asshole
Take you pain and shove it up your asshole


3. Nemesis

Tonight is the night
The empowering wind that draws breath from despite
Roars 'neath my wings as I soar with the end in sight

Choirs ignite
A swansong for Leda
Deathknells for Troy
Tragedy blooms from one act
I am nemesis

Poured in my arms
When my daughter's eyelids closed
I swore to slaughter those
Who stole my ray of moonlight

So strike up the skies
The diction of thunder
God-given rites
No fiction can deafen the fact
I am nemesis

Cowled in the utter grief
I am the priest of a new disorder
Whose flag unfurled
Bears a hatred for the western world

The is no compromise
No piped lament
To stay the blind
Just a shrike cacophony of war

Ashes ember, fires rise
No longer am I paralysed
Now I drown in a loss worth fighting for

Black is my heart
Black is my heart
Black is my heart
I am nemesis

Black is my heart
Black is my heart
Black is my heart
I am nemesis
Nemesis
Nemesis

Tonight is the night
The city sweats fever, the filth in her womb
Shifts like the season's unease at the hands of doom

Restless inside
Her split underbelly
Suitored with flies
Martial bowels now contract
I am nemesis

Poured in my arms
When my daughter's eyelids closed
I swore to slaughter those
Who stole my ray of moonlight
Never again
Our enemies entertained
I toy at the clasp of her chain
And remember the fight

Cowled in utter grief
I am the priest of a new disorder
Whose flag unfurled
Bears a hatred for the western world

There is no compromise
No piped lament to stay the blind
Just a shrike cacophony of war

Ashes ember, fires rise
No longer am I Palestined
Now I drown in a loss worth fighting for

Black is my heart
Black is my heart
Black is my heart
I am nemesis

Black is my heart
Black is my heart
Black is my heart
I am nemesis

Black is my heart
Black is my heart
Black is my heart
I am nemesis

Black is my heart
Black is my heart
Black is my heart
I am nemesis
Nemesis


4. Gabrielle

Foul snake despair
Where once you darkened gardens
Another coils there
Where twice you sliced all hope from me
And left these present scars
An insane love now burns above
The weft of incandescent stars

Hilt your dripping fangs that range
Skywards to rend apart
I might have sang of wings unchained
But long before I locked my heart

For Gabrielle
A fit and perfect stitch of foreign parts
Whose beauty fostered poets
Whose laugh like silver bells
Thawed your bitter winter from my path

Gabrielle

Foul snake despair
Where once you peddled secrets
Another spoils there
With speech that sweetens drowning
In deep lagoons of eyes
And legs that begged apologies
For lengths that mesmerised

Spare your hissing sentiments
For her fee welts more than thine
Though no malice she weans
Just a palace of dreams
Where windswept chambers pine

For Gabrielle
Whose hair-spun onyx is run with gold
Her rouge lips smack of dark blood
Her name in whisper rolls
Forever on my tongue
Lest her memory dissolve

Gabrielle
Oh, Gabrielle

Once crucified
I would have died
A thousand more times
Just to feel her breath
On my neck as a fervent lover
To drown her sighs
In floods of tears so well refined
And blind from spying her
In the arms of others

Gabrielle
Gabrielle

Buried inside
Where she's all but mine
Save for those that dine
Oh her, on her perfect carcass

Gabrielle
Gabrielle

Foul snake despair
Where once you wreaked my misery
Another toils there
For long lost Gabrielle
Whose nightly spreading grin
Persists in other faces
By whom I'm slowly taken in


5. Absinthe With Faust

Pour the emerald wine
Into crystal glasses
We will touch the divine
Through kisses catharsis

Let us pitch to the seven-year itch
Of the ultra-decadent
To a tainted world and the painted girls
That our fantasies spent

Tripping through boudoirs laced with opiate themes
Sipping the bizarre, tasting copious dreams
A toast to those most sacrilegious of days
Where for every whim won
One soon repays

We touched the stars
That now laugh from afar
At we, the damned
The damned
The damned
The damned

We have spent our time
Drenched in opulent splendour
But when midnight chimes
Will gilded souls surrender?

Let us drink on the giddying brink
Of pools of excrement
All manner of shit for the glamour and glitz
Mephistopheles lent

I remember the night as if it were engraved
A bright marble bridge stretched across the dark waves
To the shore from the moon and by her grace
Came that erudite stranger
That fucker

He was a predator, creditor cold
Our blood was shed on the yellowing scroll
And all that glittered was not gold
But we wanted everything
And for it all, lost our souls

Come my friend, to fate let's raise
Two finger shots at this our last soiree
For tomorrow I fear
Swoops all too deadly near
This precipitous weir to Hell's high gate

We touched the stars
That now laugh from afar
At we, the damned
The damned
The damned
The damned

He was a preditor, creditor, cold.
Our blood was shed on the yellowing scroll.
And all that glittered, was not gold.
But we wanted everything,
And for it all, lost our souls.

Our souls
For it all lost our souls
Our souls


6. Nymphetamine (Overdose)

Evanescent like the scent of decay
I was fading from the race
When in despair, my darkest days
Ran amok and forged her face
From the fairest of handmaidens to
A slick perverted wraith

Nymphetamine

Heaving midst narcissus
On a maledict blanket of stars
She was all three wishes
Sex, sex, sex

A lover hung on her death row
I was hooked on her disease
Highly strung like Cupid's bow
Whose arrows hungered meat
And the blinding flare of passion
In the shade of narrow streets
Where their poison never rationed
All the tips they left in me

Two tracks
Bric-a-brac
Something passed between us
Like a bad crack
Upward-lit
I'd met another kind

Of rat
In fact
With every Rome inside me
Licked and ransacked
She haunted at the corners of my mind

In black
Cataracts
Wouldn't whitewash away
Her filthy smoke stack
She burnt me like a furnace
For my future suicide

Lead to the river
Midsummer, I waved
A 'V' of black swans
On with hope to the grave
All through Red September
With skies fire-paved
I begged you appear
Like a thorn for the holy ones

Cold was my soul
Untold was the pain
I faced when you left me
A rose in the rain
So I swore to thy razor
That never, enchained
Would your dark nails of faith
Be pushed through my veins again

Bared on your tomb
I'm a prayer for your loneliness
And would you ever soon
Come above unto me?
For once upon a time
From the binds of your lowliness
I could always find
The right slot for your sacred key

Six feet deep is the incision
In my heart, that barless prison
Discolours all with tunnel vision
Sunsetter
Nymphetamine
Sick and weak from my condition
This lust, a vampyric addiction
To her alone in full submission
None better
Nymphetamine

Nymphetamine, nymphetamine
Nymphetamine girl
Nymphetamine, nymphetamine
My nymphetamine girl

Wracked with your charm
I am circled like prey
Back in the forest
Where whispers persuade
More sugar trails
More white lady laid
Than pillars of salt

Fold to my arms
Hold their mesmeric sway
And dance her to the moon
As we did in those golden days

Christening stars
I remember the way
We were needle and spoon
Mislaid in the burning hay

Bared on your tomb
I'm a prayer for your loneliness
And would you ever soon
Come above unto me?
For once upon a time
From the binds of your holiness
I could always find
The right slot for your sacred key

Six feet deep is the incision
In my heart, that barless prison
Discolours all with tunnel vision
Sunsetter
Nymphetamine
Sick and weak from my condition
This lust, a vampyric addiction
To her alone in full submission
None better
Nymphetamine

Sunsetter
Nymphetamine (Nymphetamine)
None better
Nymphetamine

Two tracks
Bric-a-brac
Something passed between us
Like a bad crack
Upward-lit
I'd met another kind

Of rat
In fact
With every Rome inside me
Licked and ransacked
She haunted at the corners of my mind

In black
Cataracts
Wouldn't whitewash away
Her filthy smoke stack
She burnt me like a furnace
For my future suicide


7. Painting Flowers White Never Suited My Palette

8. Medusa And Hemlock

Dim the lights, wrong the rites
Toss the puerile cross away
We are gashing from a venomous womb

Burning bright, dead of night
Pyres stain a milky way
Lust is splashing the dark side of the moon

In the Samhain mist
We lay in welcome by the western gate
With the five fold kiss
For every soul returning
From the fecund abyss
Where nature's travesties congregate
With a stone cold wish
To see the wicker man burning

The wind, she whispers
Through the graveyards of our hearts:
Wreathed in dreams
As she weaves her witchcraft
We breathe, enamoured
Of the conquering dark

Medusa and Hemlock

Harvest past, fires cast
Ashen shades this Halloween
We are set now to Beherit the earth

Widdershins, death begins
To fashion fete to gallow scenes:
Spirits rising to discredit rebirth

In the Samhain mist
We lay in welcome by the western gate
With the five fold kiss
For every soul returning
From the fecund abyss
Where nature's travesties congregate
With a stone cold wish
To see the wicker man burning

The wind, she flitters
Through the forest of our hearts:
Wreathed in leaves
As she weaves her witchcraft
We breathe, enamoured
Of the conquering dark

I will trace the knot of serpents in your hair
Plot your face, then ascending marble stares
You shall pluck me, masked, from roses-in-despair
Tasting my blood
That runs from worming tongue like prayer

Under pagan veneer snakes a fear
That makes the stars
Grieve, just to be
Uncharted on this eve
When part of me chars a path
Through your heavenly constellations

Medusa and Hemlock

Back to black, hinges crack
Rituals call obscenities
Sheets of demons rush insanity skies

Tread the salt, the dead exult
Preachers beg our clemency
Seeking warmth in inhumanity's eyes

We who kept the candle by the vault

We who kept the candle on the cult


9. Coffin Fodder

The time has come
To rise again
Freedom lift thy sewered hem
Free from beasts and skewered men

My dreams unroll
Ten thousand fold
Their world will never take me
They will never desecrate my soul

The stars I have grasped
Are so far lonely constellations
And wishing on those stars
My spirit bars annihilation

From earthen miseries
Hosts of most fell forms of greed
Ghosts of pearly gate remissions

Forever haunting me
Slit the witch and watch him bleed
As with any inquisition

Lying from the start
The preachers piled their craft
Scoffing elder glories
And dying, I depart
To make their sunken hearts
A coffin for their stories

The time is past
The falter when
Freedom slips my sombre pen
And the gates to wolves break open then

My feelings may
Seem constant prey
But claws no more will rake me
Those whores have fled to darker days

Above and beyond
I have wronged in my position
But now the winds are strong
To soar from Babel's vision

Of cutthroat jealousies
Dock to dock these mongrels breed
Dogs of fogged derision

Pacing, soon to be
Back to pack mentality
When my killing moon is risen

Trying from the start
These creatures of the dark
Were quaffing morning glories
And dying, I depart
To make their drunken hearts
A coffin for their stories

Innovation in ovation
Imagination stirs

Somewhere the dusk is lining
Red the shore of a roaring sea
And though loved there is someone pining
For the waves of blood to run and rescue me:

The time has come
To rise again
Freedom lift thy sewered hem
Free from beasts and skewered men

My dreams unroll
Ten thousand fold
Their world will never take me
They will never desecrate my soul

Their world will never break me
They will never desecrate my soul


10. English Fire

Seven brides serve me seven sins
Seven seas writhe for me
From Orient gates to R'lyeh
Abydos to Thessaly
And Sirens sing from stern
But now I cease to play
For I yearn to return
To woodland ferns
Where Herne and his wild huntress lay

Now the tidal are turning
Spurning the darkness
The great purgations of distinguished tours
Are but stills in time
To the thrill that I'm
Once more
Heading to the bedding
Of her English shores

The wind bickered in Satanic mill sails
Eyes flickered in deep thickets of trees
And mists clung tight in panic to vales
When Brigantia spoke her soul to me

From Imbolg to Bealtaine
Lughnasadh to Samhain feasts
I heard her lament as season's blent
Together a chimerical beast

Now the tidal are turning
Churning in darkness
The celebrations of extinguished wars
Are but stills in time
To the chill that climbs
Once more
Dreading the red weddings
On her English shores

Gone are the rustic summers of my youth
Cruel winter cut their sacred throats
With polished scythes that reap worldwide
Pitch black skies and forest smoke

And the hosts that I saw there
Drones of carrion law
Drove the ghosts of my forbears
To rove and rally once more

One of her sons from the vast far-flung
Come home to rebuild
The rampant line of the Leonine
Risen over pestilent fields

Now the tidal are turning
Burning in darkness
The salvation of her hungry sword
Shalt spill like wine
From the hills to chines
That pour
Spreading her beheadings
On these English shores

For the hosts that I saw there
Drones of carrion law
Drove the ghosts of my forbears
To rove and rally once more

This is a waking for England
From it's reticent doze
This is a waking for England
Lest hope and glory are regarded as foes


11. Filthy Little Secret

There hides a secret
Deeply twined inside of her mind
A tried and confined egret
That pines to fly south
To this mouth of mine

Pity

Too long have these emotions
Like potions, made me
A sole castellan
Trusted to keep
The weight of oceans
From her rusted gates of sleep

A dreaming angel
Lying curled in the circles of Hell
I must protect her
Watch her back for any cracks to occur
For in the witching hour
She slips into the underworld
A pearled Persephone
Deflowered by the powers
Hat around her
Down her
Whirl

Doomed to damn the rift
Across the shifting abyss
With her body and it's gift:
My filthy little secret

I serve her slender hope
To preserve mankind from old ghosts
Disturbed though by recurring crimes
I sense that dead
Might be best for both

Pity

Too long have these emotions
Like potions, made me
A sole castellan
Posted to keep
Slow wheels in motion
From the human race to beat

Without her there
My nymphetamine with the faraway stare
Thin walls would crumble
Horrors would corroborate from dogstar lairs
For in the dead of the night
She spasms with orgasmic flare
This reamed Demeter
With Poseidons there inside her
Too appeased to grieve our air

Doomed to dam the rift
Across the shifting abyss
With her body and it's gift:
My filthy little secret

Forever sworn to keep it
My filthy little secret

Pity

Too long this urchin princess
Has incensed, made me
A wanton felon
Searching for the key
To loose her harness
And set desires lurching free

Without her there
My nymphetamine with the faraway stare
Thin walls would crumble
Horrors would corroborate from dogstar lair
But in her room at night
I care not for the underworld
Slathering and gathering emboldened Reichs
To breach, to teach
A dread thereafter

I would risk all this
For one minute of bliss
With her body and it's gift
My filthy little secret

Forever sworn to keep it
My filthy little secret

I know a deeper beauty shines
Beyond the veil
Her roots and creepers mine
As the worms beneath rise


12. Swansong For A Raven

Forgive the day's
Last serenades
Her skies they bruise like Nordic women
Deep crimson stains
That Death would claim
His robes of office swim in

As would I
For his dark eye
Has fixed, a basilisk, a scythe
On charred remains
With shared disdain
For those I chose to mortify

Their cries
Have paralysed
And the smoke has choked these vistas
But still I lie
Though tears have died
On the grave of my Clarissa

A verse for her whispered to the earth
(A lover's curse is a see-through coffin)
Praises her curves so oft concurred

Though she was:
No Snow White on the night she died
Her shadower's boon when the moon glazed over
Lipped with blood and secrets pried

For on and in they spread her wide
That seraph bride
The Devil's pride
Shalt soon avenge with swift reprise

But they would writhe
For my dark eye
Bewitched, was fixed like Mordecai's
On Esther's reign
And in this vein
I saw their lust still stain her thighs

Their cries
Have paralysed
And the smoke has choked these vistas
But still I lie
Though tears have died
On the grave of my Clarissa

Beneath these trees where the mist enwreathes
Her spirit flees, seeing chains of torches
A fleeting kiss stirring leaves of poetry:

I was:
No dark knight, breaking men like ice
I was like a lycanthrope until the moon glazed over
Lipped with blood and last goodbyes

Now I dream
Enwrapt in pure clouds of the sweetest oblivion
Where beauty streams
Freed from the teeth of those beasts that had come
To tear out her spells
In red lettered cells
Wherein even the crown prince of Hell
Come out of his arrogant shell
Would falter to better

But her face soon dispels
And as black feathers fell
From heaven's smoke
So I woke to insanity
Her exquisite corpse
Found fit for their sport
Of course
Would burn on the morrow with me:

And there on this night
Strung up in my sight
Naked she sways
Displayed for their vulgar delight

I scream through my bars at the stars
That for these crimes of mine solace me
I will fear not the flames
That to passion are tame
Not nearly the same searing pain
(I pray) As held sway upon losing her
Nor the mettle of roars
That will settle like ashes and scores
As with our ghosts in the fog
When we both turn no more


13. Mother Of Abominations

Mother of abominations
Our Lady Overkill
Smothering the congregation
Grips the cosmic wheel
A lover of acceleration
No mercy or brakes applied
I see dead stars collide
In her cold unflinching powerslide

Comets tear the skies
Gushing from a shattered silence
Never so alive
Like the rush of cum on nymphetamines
Minds desanitized
Nightchords rung on a ladder of violence
Darkness fantasised
Sleek and polished black

Instrumental in stripping Gods
To neuter and mute their staves
Thereafter
Her laughter
Shalt sound aloft their future graves

Heavens above
Fear the Gorgon eyes of a new moon rising
Except no love
When she enters your golden halls
Millennial the whore
Riding wide astride the horns of madness
Clarions forth the war
Spilling the wine of her fornication
Perennial the gore
Filling the lines between split nations
Seeping under doors
In time tides force a wider crack

Mother of abominations
Our Lady Overkill
Smothering the congregation
Licks the royal milk

The scourge hangs at her girdle
Death slathers near her heel
Seeking blood to curdle
When the gathered clouds reveal
Her roared abortive labour
Thighs slick with molten steel
Dripping into sabres
For Vulcan spawn to wield

Instrumental in stripping Gods
To neuter and lash her slaves
Thereafter
Her laughter
Shalt sound aloft the crashing waves

Heaven's above
Fear the gorgon eyes of a new caste rising
Expect no love
When they enter your golden halls
On sanguine floods
Hear the foregone cries of the last surviving
Skewered like doves
Outside the wailing walls Mother of abominations
Our Lady Overkill
Smothering the congregation
Grips the cosmic wheel
A lover of acceleration
No mercy or brakes applied
I see dead stars collide
In her cold unflinching powerslide

Comets tear the skies
Gushing from a shattered silence
Never so alive
Like the rush of cum on nymphetamines
Minds desanitized
Nightchords rung on a ladder of violence

Sleek and polished black

14. Nymphetamine (Fix)

Lead to the river
Midsummer, I waved
A 'V' of black swans
On with hope to the grave
All through Red September
With skies fire-paved
I begged you appear
Like a thorn for the holy ones

Cold was my soul
Untold was the pain
I faced when you left me
A rose in the rain
So I swore to thy razor
That never, enchained
Would your dark nails of faith
Be pushed through my veins again

Bared on your tomb
I am a prayer for your loneliness
And would you ever soon
Come above unto me?
For once upon a time
From the binds of your lowliness
I could always find
The right slot for your sacred key

Six feet deep is the incision
In my heart, that barless prison
Discolours all with tunnel vision
Sunsetter
Nymphetamine
Sick and weak from my condition
This lust, a vampyric addiction
To her alone in full submission
None better
Nymphetamine

Nymphetamine, nymphetamine
Nymphetamine girl
Nymphetamine, nymphetamine
My nymphetamine girl

Wracked with your charm
I am circled like prey
Back in the forest
Where whispers persuade
More sugar trails
More white lady laid
Than pillars of salt
(Keeping Sodom at night at bay)

Fold to my arms
Hold their mesmeric sway
And dance out to the moon
As we did in those golden days

Christening stars
I remember the way
We were needle and spoon
Mislaid in the burning hay

Bared on your tomb
I am a prayer for your loneliness
And would you ever soon
Come above unto me?
For once upon a time
From the binds of your holiness
I could always find
The right slot for your sacred key

Six feet deep is the incision
In my heart, that barless prison
Discolours all with tunnel vision
Sunsetter
Nymphetamine
Sick and weak from my condition
This lust, a vampyric addiction
To her alone in full submission
None better

15. Bestial Lust

She is open wide, She isn't hard to please
She drives me fucking wild I want her on her knees
She floats and insists I am hot and can't resist
She suck me to the core
(Now) I can't take no more

That Bitch
She turns me to a beast
Bestial lust
(Come on) Bitch

Each tendon muscle rippling She drink my sove with greed
She fuck my helpless body and she just raise the speed
She let her wet tongue roll I gasp and can't control
She is hot and drives me wild and still she is open wide

Just when this torture seems to end
She is there to drain my sove again
(Come on ride, to ride on me bitch)

Bestial Lust


16. Devil Woman

I've had nothing but bad luck
Since the day I saw that cat at my door
So I came into you sweet lady
Answering your mystical call

Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she cast

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

Give me the ring on your finger
And let me see the lines on your hand
I can see me a tall dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned

I drank the potion she offered me
I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I came there for

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind, hind
(Stay away, you cunt)

If you're out on a moonlit night
Be careful of them neighbourhood strays
Of a lady with long black hair
Trying to win you with Nymphetamine ways

Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
You'd better get out of there fast

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you


17. Soft White Throat

A voyeur in league with the great thief night
In an overthrow of woven light
Slid in to rob the prayers
She whispered to the air with thin deliberation

"Spare me from the wolves
Clawing past my door
Tear me from the ghouls
That start to gnaw my fingers"

Following Her heart
And every beat that spoke
I kissed Her risen, naked
Soft white throat

Soft white throat

Incense lit at perfection's feet
Has never burnt so sickly sweet
As the fragrance of Her breath
When Her lips met death with such imagination

"Bear me to the moon
The dour toll of bells
Scare me with their boon
Of Winter's bitter graveyards"

Swallowing Her fear
I veered beneath Her coat
Of soft white meat on
Soft white throat

Crepuscular, the lust in Her
Went supernova
Setting maps aflame
Before Her veins ran colder
And muscular, the final thrust
In Her spilled over...
Covering Her back
I saw an angel lift Her coma

I fell to eyes
Of a bestial past
That once, teaching grief through jaded pupils
Now shone like celestial glass in Hell

And doused in the glow from Her parting gift
Never there lay, with curves like snowdrifts
A beauty so frozen in bliss...
Slumped to warm the dead to a standing ovation

"Spare me from the wolves
Clawing past my door
Tear me from the ghouls
That start to gnaw my fingers"

Following Her heart
And every beat that spoke
I kissed Her risen, naked
Soft white throat

Crepuscular, the lust in Her
Went supernova
Setting maps aflame
Before Her veins ran colder
And muscular, the final thrust
In Her spilled over...
Smothering Her cracks
I was the devil on Her shoulder

"Dear Lord I cry, before I die
Grant me the taste of love
One final time lest I should hide
When seraph call me from above

And should remorse not stay my course
From debt, addresses wept
Will ask no more of you my Lord
Save that my soul in Hell is kept"


18. Bestial Lust (Bitch)

She is open wide
She isn't hard to please
She drives me fucking wild I want her on her knees
She floats and insists I am hot and can't resist
She suck me to the core I (now) can't take no more

That Bitch
She turns me to a beast
BESTIAL LUST
(C'mon) Bitch

Each tendon muscle rippling
She drink my sove with greed
She fuck my helpless body and she just raise the speed
She let her wet tongue roll I gasp and can't control
She is hot and drives me wild and still she is open wide

Just when this torture seems to end
She is there to drain my sove again
(Come on ride, to ride on me bitch)

BESTIAL LUST

19. Prey

Nightfall, in thrall
I call her beauty to me
Whose ebon-lidded eyes excite
Shadows to wander through me
Whose kiss glittered with sleep
Is a thief come after dark
To steal away the leaden wreaths
From my cemetery heart

Nightfall, in thrall
I call her beauty to me
Whose ebon-lidded eyes excite
Shadows to wander through me
Whose kiss glittered with sleep
Is a thief come after dark
To steal away the leaden wreaths
From my cemetery heart

Thrilled to see the light
Bruise-reddened, silhouetting
Murder sites
As dusk attends her sons' blood wedding
Spilt across the skies
In reefs of omen
Licking flames and pagan rites
The night awaits with baited thighs

Start this artist darkness

Yearning now to start this
Burning as an artist
Turning on the darkness
Dizzy looking up with pervertigo
A sewer deity of recrement
World below

I'll make you pray

I spy with wicked lips
The cream of mortal kind
Committing their sins
Their penitent skins
To the harems of my mind

Prey

Thrilled to breathe tonight
The sultry air of graces
Passed in flight
Like birds of May with playful faces
Fills me with delight
Their crystal skirts
Spun from stars, worn tight
Wink of fists in wishful places

Start this artist darkness

Yearning now to start this
Burning as an artist
Turning on the darkness
Dizzy looking up with pervertigo
A sewer deity of recrement
World below

I'll make you pray

My whims like smoke in summertime
Writhe atop the blooms
Committing their thin
White Catholic limbs
To the cloister in my room

You see I need
To feed my dreams to order
To be agreed
With the beast in me
That bleeds their borders

Prey

Nightfall, in thrall
I call her beauty to me
Whose ebon-lidded eyes excite
Shadows to wander through me
Whose kiss glittered with sleep
Is a thief come after dark
To steal away the leaden wreaths
From my cemetery heart

21. Mr. Crowley

Mr. Crowley, what went on in your head?
Oh, Mr. Crowley, did you talk to the dead?
Your life style to me seemed so tragic
With the thrill of it all
You fooled all the people with magic
Yeah you waited on Satan's call

Mr. Charming, did you think you were pure?
Mr. Alarming, in nocturnal rapport
Uncovering things that were sacred
Manifest on this Earth
Conceived in the eye of a secret
And then scattered the afterbirth
Go

Mr. Crowley, won't you ride my white horse?
Oh, Mr. Crowley, it's symbolic of course
Approaching a time that is classic
I hear that mating call
Approaching a time that is drastic
Standing with their backs to the wall

Was it polemically sent?
I want to know what you meant
I want to know
I want to know what you meant
Go.

1. Under Pregnant Skies She Comes Alive Like Miss Leviathan

2. Dirge Inferno

"Carrion my name
For those who choose to mouth the curse
A tragic serenade
With Judas in my stride
The Gothic halls of shame
Where statues coldly hold no worse
Than the murders I reclaim
From a dark, forsaken time"

Kissing heaven, spent
He wipes lips free of his hectic discharge
Wishing to repent
For the brute that ravaged free
In slight hands beauty weeps
Conquest's deep methodical screwing
Hurt repeatedly
Like the world wound at his feet

Dirge Inferno

As it is written, damn it
So let it be wrung
From throats of those in overthrow
The past at last has come

A savage bit without respite
Pervades the freezing air
This winter chill, grist for his mill
If tears of joy will blear elsewhere
And church bells drown in the cracks of doom
The storms above us hew
As lightning runs like bifurcate tongues
Deflowering two by two

Hissing, malcontent
He storms the skies on electric discharge
Pissing in contempt
On the effigies of the weak
Killing all resolve
The great beast simmers, his scarlet women
Spit their vitriol
On the terrified face of peace

Dirge Inferno

As it is written, damn it
So let it be wrung
From throats of those in overthrow
Our past at last has come

A hellbound heart, the rose and thorn
Have locked to hasten blood
The moon disrobes, to harden droves
Of legions pouring
These rivers press, his breath adorns
Senates and enemy seats
Whilst his power takes as ingratitude
The writhing of the weak

"Wormwood my name
The poisoned star that fell to earth
And blistered free of shame
In the pits of self-rebirth
Now those caves become a Garret
Overseeing endless barracks
As the waters turn to claret
And the Vatican satins burn"


3. Tonight In Flames

"I will give to drink without cost,
From the spring of the water of life.
He who overcomes will inherit all this...
And I will be his God... and he will be my son."

When contrary winds blow across the sands
Their murmurs can be easily swayed
But when storms quicken one cannot placate
The howling of their murderous rages

Winged seraphim hold love's trembling hand
Beside our waiting graves
As war roars about out precious land
Seeking cause to subjugate

Tonight in flames
Tonight the world will fear our names
Tonight in flames
Stay my feeble heart
Our deaths will be the start
Of something glorious and vain
Tonight in flames

There is no fanaticism as virile as faith
To the blind his words are clear
"Suffer not the infidel! Suffer not the infidel!
Assure your place in paradise here"

Winged seraphim hold love's trembling hand
Beside her tiny grave
I will avenge her, do or damned
Her sacred mother did the same

I went to see her dance one day
In a play by a wailing wall
Now she is gone
But the song lives on
Zealous and maniacal

(But) the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, (the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts,) the idolaters and all liars--their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. (This is the second death.)"

The Eastern sword must fall

Tonight in flames
Tonight the world will fear our names
Tonight in flames
Stay my feeble heart
Our deaths will be the start
Of something glorious and vain
Tonight in flames


4. Libertina Grimm

Howitzer glare and spitfire blade
Wooed by Dresden serenades
Her soundtrack now a bombing raid
Bored of vaudeville

God was six days sober
On the night that she was born
To the glistening star of a bible class
An icon now in religious porn
She was Alice through the glory hole
An ejaculate misconception
Disney-esque, the high priestess
Of greed and deepest dark deception

All best to bury whims
For Miss Libertina Grimm

She, that little red riding crop
Brer Werewold at her stocking tops
Beneath the tightened leather strop
Of the basque of the houndervilles

At the stroke of midnight come
She polished verse and hearses
In a poisonous pen dipped in omen
To her surgeon full of general curses
In the hand of morgue redeemers
Though the dead always pleased her more
Squatting in their coffins
Flirting curtsies to the thirteenth floor

Tip your hats
For sweet Libertina Grimm

Fantasy and candy stores
Snow white and the seven straws
Smoke and mirrors on all fours...
Libertina Grimm

Her brothers grim, her sisters through
The final dance will be the cue
She amputates to fit the shoe
Libertina Grimm

Libertina Grimm

Mystery kindled in a blackened room
Nine candles lit to improve the gloom
She sees the dark as she feels womb
Full of hidden secrets
They haunt her heart, those precious few
Those Count Lestats and Betty Blues
Those tortured souls just like me and you
Full of hidden secrets

No, don't go
Don't you leave me
So alone
Libertina
No, don't you go
Don't you leave me here
So alone
Where the dead are free to roam


5. The Byronic Man

As lonely as a poet on the wall of Jericho
Or the moon without the comfort of the stars
I am loathe to know it that a man without a soul
Is nothing but a split canopic jar

I proved it, improved it
Drove a sonnet right through it
And in this state of bliss
Evil kissed with wet lips
Pen-filled fingertips
Which drew me, for through me
Illuminati usually pissed
But with words of some hurts worth
I threw a party that extended God's list

Exciting new flames that my fame would claim for me
Reciting back the almanac of travesties

They call me bad
Mad Caliban with manner
Dangerous to know
A passing fad
Taught in all debauch
In excess and in canto

Grown wild this child
Whole harems defiled
Faustina's and Mina's
Lady Libertine and her sisters between her

What spread of lies arise when lovers die
Which circle of hell is mine when I arrive?

They call me bad
Mad Caliban with manners
Dangerous to know
A passing fad
Taught in all debauch
Crow against the virgin snow

Grown colder, my shoulder
Like a boulder beside her
And bolder, not wiser
My dark seed took up root inside he
That mouldered, where older

Beddings would hold a passionate sigh
But laudanum and soda
Lord Numb coda
Merited a forest of inherited spite

Fleeing grief for foreign maps
I still played vampire aristocrat
Unloading my gun in hot, promiscuous laps

Then shooting swans in a gondola
I tripped my foot on a fallen star
And there's nothing like a mouthful of Venetian tar
To let you know just who you fucking are

The patron saint of heartache
You can't see my world is falling
The world is falling down
The patron saint of heartache
Can't see the world is falling
My world is falling down

Ever after, can they hear my laughter?
The patron saint of heartache
Never craft a better bed of disaster...
The patron saint of heartache

They call me bad
Made Caliban with manners
Dangerous to know
A passing fad
Taught in all debauch
In excess and in canto

They call me bad
Mad Caliban with manners
Dangerous to know
A passing fad
Whereupon I tell them
To go fuck their mothers
As so...
On my grave


6. I Am The Thorn

The needle in the eye of the hurricane
The poison in the font
The nail in the coffin of the profane
I am the lot

Maniacal the fire
That weaves inside my should
When dripping tongues of hate, envenomed, roll
Like carpet bombs in vast bazaars
My blood runs with the beasts
Though no crescent, cross
Or wandering star
Shalt witness my defeat

Born of jackal in the Vatican
To a loathsome flock I have crept behind the drapes
And a wizard there is not
Just a white flag blackened by
Singing weapons that have led
A faith that soon dominions over
Desert kingdoms of the dead

I smell the fleur du malcontent
The hellish stench
Of Judas in the dozens

Bouquets for greed and twisted law
Handmaidens of a holy war
Bring on a thousand roses more
I am the thorn
Tangled are the thickets
That spare the virgin heart
From the waking grasp of rapists in the dark

Mountaineers that strive so far
For a Heaven grown from reach
That love herself is fabled
To be missing from their peaks
Save in one sole tower
Where the presence of a rod
Stays the sleeping beauty
From the prying fingers of the mob

I smell the fleur du malcontent
The hellish stench
Of Judas in the dozens

Bouquets for greed and twisted law
Handmaidens of a holy war
Bring on a thousand roses more
I am the thorn

I am the thorn

I am the Spear of Longinus
The sword of Damocles
Kali up in arms, a bleeding sinus
The hammer of the gods in the prophet's teeth

Saint Disgustus, President Evil
Great white hopes of a shark-eyed people
Light of the world now flicker and die

Impaled in the race, in the paling face
Where forked tongues pricked the skies
Choking on these words as I slither to their ear
A lightning strikes their blinded mains

I am not the hand of god...
I am the thorn

Territorial thieves
Ever stealing thunder for religious causes
I will bring you all down to your knees

And fuck you over


7. Cemetery And Sundown

We rise with the sun in the underworld
We suffer from a graveless name
We prise wide lids
And wounds with lips curled
Over teeth that have tasted shame

Cemetery and sundown

Against the flora of nightfall
We gather like the fauna of war
To cure Aurora so spiteful
With her stake in the coming of dawn
To conjure forth the past
Those heady nights of pain resplendent
In the service of the Goddess of Death
When her sheets ran royalty red

Moon lengthen or crypt-kept silhouettes
Shadows dance, eyes flicker in descent
Unveil the greed, our needs are bitter, spent
On upturned mouths and haunts of wickedness

We walk this Eden, a secret
Faces hidden under Leonine pride
In dusk's embrace
We find it hard to keep it
When blood and lust and waking worlds collide

Too long have we skulked like drifters
In the cities of the neon sun
Vagabond dogs and graveyard shifters
Mona Lisa's where the paint has run
I miss our glorious past
Our nightly flights on fear dependent
Like phantoms in the eaves for Miss Christine
When the song bird broke her neck

Wolves howl their fogbound serenades
Churches arch their backs with balustrades
Praise be to the shedding of masquerades
When we hunt these vestal vermin unafraid
Of the covenant made...

Draw the blinds on the floors of raw meat
There is murder in the thirst

Rich red vascular tapestries
Hung in gilded frames of nuns asleep
In dreams where themes of bestiality
Are a blessing on their Sunday sheep

Sermons hang a black gown
Over cemetery and sundown

Now the clock is harrying midnight
And the ghost of yet-to-come
Will she show rewrites of dark delight
Or the sewers we've overrun?
I see a winter palace
Cut diamonds at a porcelain neck
When Swan Lake crushed poor sanity's spirit
As I threw her to it bled

We rise with the sun in the underworld
We suffer from a graveless name
We prise wide lids
And wounds with lips curled
Over teeth that have tasted shame

We walk this Eden, a secret
Faces hidden under Leonine pride
In dusk's embrace
We find it hard to keep it
When blood and lust and waking worlds collide.


8. Lovesick For Mina

One might see in Mina
My disease
But it was She who has infected me
For all eternity...

As the sun slips the tearaway stars
Into the scented scheme of night
I kissed her mouth like a dark red rose
Set upon a marbled dream of white
So pure of thought like a Vestal statue
Jewelled with a God-lent grace
I was close to coming when she bid adieu
Fuelled by heartache rent upon her face there

On Mina, obscener
Thoughts obsess my days
Oh Mina, obscener
Thoughts possess me
That I must now obey

They say the darkest hour
Is that before the dawn
When nothing in one's power
Can dissipate the great forlorn
Shadows of fire that haunt me
Like risen whispers of her name

For dawn is a dusk
Wherein needs must
Erupt from the grave, aflame

Written in the dead of night
And riding on the burning wind
Smitten by her read delight
My words alight like leave of sin

Stepping through a mirror
The princess of the emerald glass
Brought me on sip nearer
Love's infernal past...

They say Hell hath no furies
Like a woman scorned by life
When the Heavenly Judge and juries
Participate to chain this wife
With forced virtue, Her secret needs
On warm we nights, with storm-wracked bites
I gave her Eden after the flood

Written in the dead of night
And riding on the burning wind
Smitten by her read delight
My words alight like leaves of sin

Verona, Marishka, Aleera
Brides of old and goddesses all
Forgive my wishes to be always near her
Forever or whenever seas recall

The Aphrodite from my embrace
For as Mars (whom her lips placate)
I tore these shores with wars of hatred
Before our Paris wet his fate
In Helen, one might find mistake
In winning tragedy
For all eternity...

I am still lovesick for Mina
I am still so lovesick for her


9. The Foetus Of A New Day Kicking

I'm chaos international
The writing on the wall
A Lazarus in parable

A dark and sullen lullaby
Whispered softly as you die
Promising torments are nigh

Danger warning levels hissed out loud
I saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
Now I'm reeling from the shock at ground zero

If yesterday you would have stood up proud
Then why tonight have you thrown in with the stoning crowd?
I'll breathe through the foetus of a new day kicking...

The foetus of a new day kicking

It's true that Jesus cannot save
I'm rising from the grave
To put my double cross to shame

A poison rush, a heart attack
A white assassin painted black
You'll fear this reaper coming back

Danger warning levels hissed out loud
I saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
Now I'm reeling from the shock at ground zero

If yesterday you would have stood up proud
Then why tonight have you thrown in with the stoning crowd?
I'll breathe through the foetus of a new day kicking...

On a night like this
You laid the serpent's kiss
In this garden of Gethsemane
You played the traitor well...

In a dawn to come
I will blind the sun
To grant you pardon as my enemy

Before damning you to hell...


10. Rise Of The Pentagram

One dark afternoon
Like a shadow I flew
Through the rain that fell sick with lament

To this house of incest
For when we undressed
Blasphemies against Venus were rent

Though a sister removed
Her white body approved
The parade of my heavenly quests

Yet, all tongues are not true
Some are forked or askew
Like an uncivil serpent's at best

For ousted from Eden
I fausted all reason
Hook in mouth like Saint Peter Pan

To haunt fairy groves
And hot virgin coves
Where in the promiscuous swam

I elected lovers and rejected others
Mathistrisses that don't give a damn

But for those that still do
My deep interest grew
The rise of the true pentagram!


11. Under Huntress Moon

With the snow fallen thick
And bonfires alit
And shooting stars portents of rips
I ascended to spur
A mere glimpse of murmur
From her precious celestial lips

Be it sun to your moon
"Be it moon to your sun"
Together we promised to come
With a turn of the screw
And a slip of the tongue
We eclipsed one another undone

Through the mist, through the woods
With the night-wraiths I've stood
Atop murderous peaks calling you
On storm-lashed beachheads
Where the fisherman dread
The things your bewitchments accrue

Those deep creatures bring
Her cut diamond rings
A girl with a pearl necklace her
Advancing in fevers
Tsunamis and myrrh
Will she wreak bloody vengeance or purr?

She lights the skies
Dressed in silver scales plucked from the ocean
To spite her thighs
That Lucifer snuck inside
And with his pride
Enclaves were upgraded to Goshen
So paradise
Could shine from out her skirts

"I adorn myself at dusk
With ornaments to close the noose
A kiss as red as blood and cold as hell

My body glows with lust
Anaemic as the flag of truce
I raised at dawn to catch you in my spell"

With every twist I cannot resist her
Fertile female mind control
This wanton witch, white rapids sister
To whom I pour my wine and soul

From a copse of black yews
Where the moon was drawn through
Like a sword through a Gordian knot
She descended to me
Claiming swift victory
Over the heart I had near soon forgot

With every kiss this huntress whispered;
"Yield to my sweet embrace
One night of bliss". I could not dismiss her
Once her beauty shot me a darker face

You mesmerise my soul Diana
You mesmerise my soul


12. Temptation

I've never been closer
I've tried to understand
That certain feeling
Called by another sound
But it's too late to hesitate
We can't keep on living like this

Leave no track
Don't look back

All I desire
Temptation
Keep climbing higher and higher
Temptation
Adorable creatures
Temptation
With unacceptable features
Temptation
And trouble is coming
Temptation
It's just the high cost of loving
Temptation
You can take it or leave it
Temptation
But you'd better believe it

You've got to make me an offer
That cannot be ignored
So let's head for home now
Everything I have is yours
Step by step and day by day
Every second counts I can't break away

Leave no trace
Hide your face

Full of desire
Temptation
Keep climbing higher and higher
Temptation
And you can take it or leave it
Temptation
But you'd better believe it
yeah

Step by step
Day by day
Every second counts
I can't break away

Keep us from temptation
Lead us not into temptation

Trying to find it
Temptation
You've got to get up behind it
Temptation
Put your dime in the hot slot
Temptation
But it's a million to one shot
Temptation
You think that you're right
Temptation
Your gonna face it tonight now
Temptation
Give me a breakdown
Temptation
Because it's time for a shakedown
Temptation

14. Murder In The Thirst

15. The Snake-Eyed And The Venomous

They see me there
Their eyes are everywhere
Sniffing at the linen for the dirt
I feel their burning stare
That hate will later flare
And writhe upon their women full of hurt

Lace magic ink with venom, critics
Milked from infant teeth
Though scathing blows are so arthritic
When they're set on slow repeat

They know I care
Smell storm clouds in the air
Hissing at the bit above my heart
But though I dare
The dyed black route of splitting hairs
I favour not to tempt the poisoned apple cart

I feel two needles rising
Snake eyes are hypnotising
I know they seethe, despising
All that we possess

I feel two needles rising
The truth is always blinding
Their lies, unappetising
Toxins to digest

They breed nightmares
Dark horses of despair
Taking twisted courses in the art
And were I there
To bet my bones on grave affairs
I'd have their guts for garters from the start

I feel two needles rising
Snake eyes are hypnotising
I know they seethe, despising
All that we possess

I feel two needles rising
The truth is always blinding
Their lies, unappetising
Toxins to digest

It's not without hate to crawl flat in the filth
As other less basilisks fly
And brothers are clasped to the breasts of a sylph
As their royal loves slither to die
So shedding dead skin, working true colours loose
Renewing the red in their eyes
They coil like sin within thinning excuse
Cold-blooded to sharpen the lies

Uncivil serpents, race deceivers
Disfigureheads varnished with fevers
Snake-house creepers in our dreams
Of Eden, flee before we mean
To throw the worms out with the waters
Rife with hated spawn
And set a sword to whirl and slaughter
All vipers at the gates of dawn

17. Courting Baphomet

Wishing in contempt of love
The righteous came to burn our forest
With hissing firebrands
For though we serve the gentle curves
Of our serpent-girdled Eastern Goddess
They thought they caught us
Kissing hearses in their land

Send away the pumpkin carriage
Blind mice in your head
Parade themselves like sacrilegious
Envoys of the dead
For in this house of the dark Madonna
Flesh will pleasure life
For free of sin we would dishonour
All that virgin sacrifice

Gut our city, slaughter all within
Save the gold that goes to God
Show no pity for we worship sin
Spare not the old nor lightning rod

We raise our devil horns
To those who sit on high
For down amidst the thorns
We lie

Tonight the black guards came to rape
And ruin those souls empathising
With fleeing far away
Thrown to the Tigris river curves
Of our star tiara-ed Ishtar rising
They thought they caught us
Courting Baphomet

Courting Baphomet

Gut our city, slaughter all within
Save the gold that goes to God
Show no pity for we worship sin
Spare not the old nor lightning rod

She walked the world
When the world was made to dress
In a perfect darkness
A murderess in flame
Nature curled, unleashed, unfurled
The crack of a whip on the lips of anger
Why would your holy order
Not be wholly slain?

Wishing in contempt of love
The righteous came to burn our forest
With just verses for the damned
For though we serve the gentle curves
Of our serpent-girdled Eastern Goddess
They thought they caught us
Pissing curses in the sand

We raise our devil horns
To those who sit on high
For down amidst the thorns
We lie

We raise our devil horns


18. Stay

If this world is wearing thin
And you're thinking of escape
I'll go anywhere with you
Just wrap me up in chains
But if you try to go alone
Don't think I'll understand

Stay with me
Stay with me

In the silence of your room
In the darkness of your dreams
You must only think of me
There can be no in between
When your pride is on the floor
I'll make you beg for more

Stay with me
Stay with me

You'd better hope and pray
That you make it safe
Back to your own world
You'd better hope and pray
That you'll wake one day
In your own world
Cause when you sleep at night
They don't hear your cries
In your own world
Only time will tell
If you can break the spell
Back in your own world

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay, stay with me
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay with me


19. Devil To The Metal

Polluting the honesty of Christ with poisoned wine
Laced with lines from the end of time
From the herald and the bugler

High voltage bolts the cellar door
Switch thrown at midnight's peak
To start the heart of a scarlet whore
Gauged infernally

A poetess in night's profane station
Threading lies like silver seas
A seamstress for an amputee nation
Wedded to depravities

Devil to the metal

Diluting the authority of life with sewer brine
Laced with grime from the spiral of time
Wherein spins cruel order

The big hand strokes the Little Horn
Not thrown for charity
To win the sins of the decadent, born
To wage eternally

Passion rides the great unholy
Ipsissimus of love's despair
Her ashen grin would shine, if only
Death would not sit smiling there
Her beauty freezes reason
Like Helen at the reins
Of the rampant horse Apocalypse
On the shore that it was made

Devil to the metal

She fucks at unknown angles
Bleeds her victims to the bone
And in their guts untangled
Casts her runic eyes of stone
She will violate the future
Annihilate the past
Paving way in butcher trades
The red brick road through mankind's arse

Abandon reason, life the veil
Darker seasons are released
Storm crows gather in black masses at the pane

Go to sleep beyond the pale
She is set to murder peace
Rome, Jerusalem and Mecca are aflame

'Under pregnant skies I come alive like Miss Leviathan
Dripping with the ripples of concern
All of heaven's eyes are fixed, as only my desire can
Tear them from the stars I start to burn'

1. The Cult Of Venus Aversa

I am She
Lilith
Mistress of the dark
Of Sheba
First offender
And succour to demons
Whose sweet seductions and wicked rites
Lead all those too enslaved by the flesh
To trespass against God's holy law
And tonight I come for you

Midnight strikes, the candles sputter
Muttering their recking spells
I snuff their tongues, my heart a-flutter
These words i speak are gates to Hell

Casus belli
In hoc signo vinces
Veritas vos liberabit
Casus belli
In hoc signo vinces
In aeternum, amen

The scent of death is rent
In this ornamental verse
In ventures down the centuries
Tormenting me with secrets so anathema
And now the fires grate
I must relate, to end this curse
I'll break through spires to escape my fate
Am I too late or just perverse?

Midnight strikes, the candles sputter
Muttering their recking spells
I snuff their tongues, my heart a-flutter
These words i speak are gates to Hell

So the blight begins
Near the woodland of a frightened village
Where the rites of unimaginable sin
And the howling on the wind
Chills the blood for fear of spillage

Where nightfall used to be
Blessed with best tranquility
Its no caressed by misadventure

Templars from the crusades
Have birthed a church, more masquerade
In which they worship mass dementia

They came from dust and flame
By the Red Sea on dead shores
fleeing claims of blasphemy

And bestiality
Devils fed them back to us

Knights of holy wars, inviting hordes
Of grim infidelities
In the grip of cryptic lands
And desert sands
They found just cause

and midst their entourage
Under the stars
They Bought relics and parts
Of saints
And evil left to clerics charge

With Muslim plunder they built their sect
To the composite Baphomet
An androgynous sphinx, open, erect
Universal in its closet display

Spawn of Lilith and Samael
First offender and the snake
In thrall like pawns beneath its spell
The templars grew to astute surrender
Sabbatical, fanatical
They Adorned its monstrous bust
Whit a kings ransom of Easter jewels
The embodiment of beast and lust

Many moons the proved the boom
Of immutable and beautiful
Darkness ever-afters

Then one eve when the ancient trees
Outside, drew back, unnerved
The pleas from those impatient teased
Something from the black beyond of nowhere

A stunning woman, summoned
Comming scimitar-curved
Statuesque, but living flesh
Draping nakedness about their pagan saviours

She came Lilith, a perfect myth
The scarlet whore
Skinned in magnificence
In her defense
She only slew a few of them

Born of a sacrifice, a virgins price
For the merging with a Goddess
She prowled the world again
Enslaving men
With the surging of her bodice

Midnight strikes, the candles sputter
Muttering their recking spells
I snuff their tongues, my heart a-flutter
These words i speak are gates to Hell


2. One Foul Step From The Abyss

The Feast of Fools,
As January slipped into the grip of winter
A leather leash tightened round the throat of fate

Amidst the flock, disease and dementia
Night was blighted more than ever before
With screams of lust and obscene adventure
And scenes of raw debauch

The darkness was aroused with every kiss
And all who fell under its spell
Were one foul step from the abyss

One foul step from the abyss

Sacred village there in All Hallows Fair
Feared the templars and their Queen
For Lilith compared to a royal nightmare
When she steered their tempestuous

Fever-dreams

The beast was loose and beauty party
To the horrors of this sonorous whore
A seducer, Medusa
A frozen Hecate cloned

Stealing seed, here needs were like a cancer
Growing stronger with each whimpering dog
knelt before her, thirteen necromancers
Called from desert sands to this land of opportunity

The darkness was aroused with every kiss
And all who fell under its spell
Were one foul step from the abyss

One foul step from the abyss

love was drugged by a copious vendor
A train of servants for here decadent games
Purring on rugs in fugs of opiate splendour
Vain Lilith spread her wings again

Stars, they gasped and comets in ovation
Lit the towers, their very presence declared
They watch with lust, despair and veneration
For the Goddess scatted naked there

The painted eye of the storm

Plagues of sin, played to win
All hearts and souls in thrall
to her embraced, her fatal whims
Desire meant to conquer all

Until that fateful day, 1308
With a force blessed by the Kings of Hate
Facing winter gray to disintegrate
Once noble halls

The villagers in a belligerent horde
Fraught daughters fanning flames
Rose like pillars for their militant Lord
Thoughts of slaughter haranguing hot veins

They assailed the fort beyond the woods
as the howling broke on the stroke of midnight
Many lost their sanity at what they fought

Amidst those walls, creed of dementia
Annihilated by sheer weight of the surge
Put to the sword, freed from their calenture
The great estate was given straight to the church

Of Lilith, no limb ranked amongst the dead
But that she drank the blood of many men
That dark night it was said


3. The Nun With The Astrail Habit

The world was her cloister, the abbess Duboir
In the convent at All Hallows fair
A pearl in an oyster she shone like a star
Augmenting her sisterhoods prayers
Her singing touched Angels and melted their hearts
her choirs inspired the search
For the lost holy grail, the Benedict arts
And the best of the Catholic Church

But if one thing
One precious little thing
Would darken this facade
There would be such consequences

Like the night Sister Victoria
Stepped in from the freezing cold
No candles would light at Evening Mass

The days passed by without a sigh
But dusk came thick with dread
Intangible, the air was full

Of wanderlust and approaching bloodshed

In truth, the Abbess with her pious whims
Enjoyed the new girl's pain
Proof to the rest tat the briars of sin
Entangled all the world in Satan's name

Victoria Varco, once heiress
To a proud noble estate
Fell pregnant by her recklessness
Who then fell foul to a violent fate
Such was here cime in expedient times
And the shame of besmirching her name
Her child was burnt, she was dragged to these walls
For a life in obedient chains

But not one thing
One precious little thing
Would darken this facade

Like the night Sister Victoria
Woke screaming in her room
She spent a week spiralling from heaven

And as the seasons wheezed and pained
Her dream grew more perverse
For no good reasons she would to find
An alluring woman naked save for jewels and verse

When here eyelids close, on a moonlit shore
This intoxicating beauty would appear
The sweetest symphony composed
Those abating lips rose
Tho whisper dirty secrets in her ear

Clandestine secrets

A dream within a dream
She finds hereself this nymph
Abreast a desert dune
And below the crescent moon
Atop a darksome stranger

Ah, the spurting of his seed inside here
Triggers paradise
She rides the beast until the heavens trembled

Forcing eclipse, her lover licks her blood
That drips upon the sand
And almost out of hand
Coarse plots assemble

For somewhere in the convent walls
A templar treasure rests
Forgotten to the vestibules
Like pleasures of the flesh

So, in return for nightly runs
Past tongues and wisdom's hiss
She promised to assist the hunt
for an ancient golden chain amiss


4. Retreat Of The Sacred Heart

She slept in ecstasy
In hands that fanned her wildest fantasies
Freed from Christ's frigid regime
And rigid nails...

She was first in church
To lick her lips and self-debased
Each waking second felt like heaven
In the scarlet One's embrace

And at last, clear memories, aghast
Relinquished their control
All things held dear to the wretched past
Coalesced within her soul

Madness crept into her sight
Though her sinful hair
Spoke of nothing to the contrary
Once dulled eyes leaped alive with life
Her piece of broken mirror
Barely recognised

The worm was turning

For her sat grinning Victoria
Who, no three weeks ago
Was flogged red to euphoria
For her dour love of God
And the ardour of his crows

Cold cloisters kept the dead apart
At the Retreat of the Sacred Heart

She stepped in ecstasy
Neath skies that plied her wildest fantasies
Freed into love's reacquainted dream
And sudden gales...

Night grew sultry late September
A man came from the village
Through the woods
To help with harvest
She was burning like the fields
All her vows lay unfulfilled
His name was Isaac, silent, blessed
A mute whose tongue impressed her lately

But now red skies darken
The roonks lament
Windswept maelstroms harken
The approach of Lilith's
Nightmare kingdom

The woman in her astral dreams
Became more vivid, livid, obscene
Scatted on the throne of oayx blasphemies
Emanating raw desire
And the surging urge to scream

Darkness crept into her face
She stood erect
And spook of riches and their whereabouts
Finding in Isaac the need to place
A hidden Templer necklace
Lest the month run out

For now stormed the vainglorious
In her palace of mass delight
Her power dawned victorious
Victoria the key, her mind unfastened
By flights of morbid fancy
Psychomancy, rites of ancient wrong
Sweet seductions, peaked cruptions
Spiking through impatient song

Cold cloister kept the dead apart
At The Retreat of the Sacred Heart

The gate to hell was forced apart
At The Retreat of the Sacred Heart


5. The Persecution Song

At the very start
There were whispers in the dark
And for all the world to see
There was witchcraft at its heart
And on the autumn air
The scent of bonfires everywhere
And a fell wind stirred the leaves...

The persecution song

Telltale signs of possession
Little Miss Demeanour in the demons bed
Gasps she just could not suppress
After lights-out midst the dead
And a past on which sin cast its darts of wickedness

Time was running faster for disaster
Strange nights were burning
In the furnace of her dreams
A name was uttered, Lilith
Mistress, playmate, master
Such sights were stolen in the throes of ecstasy

And in the thick of all
In the Black Goddess's thrall
With the wood unseen for trees
Victoria stood tall
Promiscuous in step
The Devil breathing down her neck
As jealous zealots stitched apiece...

The persecution song

Telltale signs of possession
Fickle Miss Demeanour hissed and disappeared
To her Sisters of the cloth
She now reeked of Astaroth
Again the curse had surfaced
Sneaking back the pagan years

Weaving webs of great revealing
Hidden in the convent
An evil libido abided, undone
Breathing, deceiving
Feasting on her deviant feelings
She'd clung to her crucifix
Once her torturers begun

Her screams came quick
The miserichord
Den to vice and screw
That had reddened many tongues
Wrung symphonies
Of suffering from her

Many moons hardened pure hearts
Those plagued by her black arts
Their rooms secreting phantom orgies
Vile rites and rifled graves

Mere hours, now towered
Above this bent and beaten flower
Her naked body privy to
The Abbess and her ways

Victoria fought
No guilt was wrought
Just a torrid retort of blasphemies
Nails and crosses vomited forth
From this pretty little whore now arched like Hell

Arched like Hell

At the very start
There were whispers in the dark
And for all the world to see
There was witchcraft at its heart
But then the end grew nigh
A dirge inferno filled the sky
In its customary key...

The persecution song

Telltale signs of obsession
No wailing banshee would dishonour their name
Nuns dragged her to the blasted oak
Storm-clouds threatened holy smoke
They hanged her there like Judas
With the Hellcat in her reined

Time was running faster for disaster
Exorcism, torture, gallows
Now a shallow grave
A name was stuttered, Isaac
Tongue-tied, simple, bastard
They made him dig the pit
Mindless of what it claimed


6. Deceiving Eyes

On the night all mirrors fell silent
And the clocks struck accord with the rain
A storm swept in with such violence
The dead rose to complain
The stars were ill-crossed as the weather
Lost in its bitumen cloak
The Angels were warring, slick with endeavour
Falling like tears through the thickening smoke

Blood redeems, heaven torn asunder
A flood of souls scream on the rolling thunder

Blood redeems, heaven torn asunder

She stirs from dreams barely three feet under

"Victoria, I come to claim my prize
Stealing from the convent neath the wrath of seething skies
For though you greased the palm of Satan
With those moonlit silver thighs
I knew the beast took second place
When I looked into your eyes

Your deceiving eyes
Filled with lies
And missed good byes
And serpents hissing revelations

Your deceiving eyes
They tell enough
Of how I fell in love
With the goddess creeping deep inside you"

And with the tumult up above him roaring
Isaac sought her shallow grave
As lightning bolted through the grim down-pouring rain
He struck the hallowed earth again

Having torn at the soil like a man insane
Не threw his fists at the poisonous cosmos
And from that pit of shame
He bore the coffin from her sorry lot
Neath trees whose eaves were knotted with rot
Through ornate chapel doors, unlocked
To splinter her sarcophagus
And gaze upon her face

Victoria...

"Victoria, I come to claim my prize
Stealing from the convent neath the wrath of seething skies
For though you greased the palm of Satan
With those moonlit silver thighs
Making mockery of rosaries
His needs will never rival mine

I recall a summer's day
The sunlight bathed your penitential scars
As I sat and washed the blood away

Now your body stays
And the coldness of your lips
Eclipse
Like the first true kiss of winter"

Pining for the dead
On the stone floor spread
She was shining through her winding shroud
A moon amid the mad, this son of Adam had
A gift for the pretty young nun
A necklace wrought of twining snakes
Two gold illicit tongues
He laid it at her throat
Where the rope had wrung
He was burning from the furnace
Of his roused desire

He wrested with temptation
To be or unfulfilled
She was undressed for ovation
Her sumptuous form, the storm revealed

And with his driven lust exploding
Her lashes brushed his cheeks
They flickered with life, her limbs enfolding
Purring, licking wicked teeth

"Victoria, I come to claim my prize
Stealing from the convent neath the wrath of seething skies
For though you greased the palm of Satan
With those moonlit silver thighs
You have left him just for me
I see it in deceiving eyes

Those deceiving eyes
Filled with lies
And missed good byes
And serpents hissing revelations

Those deceiving eyes
They tell enough
Of how I fell in love
With the goddess re-arisen in you"


7. Lilith Immaculate

Church bells resounded like judgement day
As they were making love
In the rainswept graveyard
She fucked him hard, silhouetted by flame
A monsoon Tigress set upon prey

Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more master the faster the days

Lilith Immaculate

This delectable reaper
Her eyes were profound
Drawing him in deeper
Until he was drowned
Hurled on the shore
Of the world underground...

Lilith Immaculate

Mortal kind, a morbid wine
For this dark moon goddess
And freed to stretch her claws
This beautiful whore
Would be brutally honest

Tortuous one, taboos undone
A glittering star on a sea of myriad waves
And a thickening mist, a seductress
Leading lovesick hearts astray

Lilith

In the throes of orgasm, she bucked and he broke
At the height of the storm, the chaos they'd smote
Burning behind her in arabesque smoke
Framed a vision transformed as she sucked from his throat

Victoria smiled, her now golden eyes
Possessed a regal bearing
Of omnipotent power
From wet lips to her smouldering thighs
Her beauty perfected and her will agonised

Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more the master the faster the days

Lilith Immaculate

With dread single purpose
Her mind told him stay
She strode through the fire
Desire aflame
She murdered the nuns
In such horrible ways...

Lilith Immaculate

"That night we lay entwined on hay
Inside a soldier's barn
Her panting breath an opiate
As in her bolder grasp
I caught the scent of desert sands
The Holy lands, the fall of reason
But only when I smelt the blood
Did I fear her colder hand"

"I am darkness, I am sin
The Queen of lust invited in
Reborn at last to cast my
Fecund shadow on this world,
You shall worship me, enslaved
For many lovers shall I crave
And in return, I'll gladly pave
Your psycho path with pearls

For I have been grating
And waiting so long to find
The most perfect hostess close to me
Whose thin-ice troubled mind
Was like a cracked, black ornate mirror
To slip right through in time
When at last I wore Harmonia's necklace
The cursed twin serpents mine"

Tortuous one, debauchery won
The attention of Emperors, Princes and Tsars
For the toll of her kiss, no soul could dismiss
The advance of her throne from afar

This English rose with traits of those
Who graced the harems of the East
Adorned with thorns, she raised the horns
And scarlet hems to wasted priests

Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more master the faster the days

Lilith Immaculate

This delectable reaper
Her eyes were profound
They drew him in deeper
Until he was drowned
Hurled on the shore
Of the world underground...

Lilith Immaculate

Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more master the faster the days

Lilith Immaculate

The flutes and sweet wine
Of her voice anodyne
Her power was growing
Every hour malign
The truth, Lilith's kingdom
Drew closer with time


8. The Spawn Of Love And War

Poets racking absinthed brains
Could never fully paint these nights
No martyr parting from his pain
Could utter words so erudite
As those she now divulged to me
In throes of passions grip
Indulging latent fantasies
That ran forked tongues along the lip

Of fate's pudenda
The twisted snake's agenda
Now the world would bend
To her deadly legacy

Life's graveyard was waiting, such dizzying flight
From the convent at All Hallows Fair
Without contemplating, we fled through the night
Too blood-drunk and cunt-sated to care

The Goddess had spoken
And woken desire
It crackled in the air around us
A psychic force shimmering like fire

And on her breasts. that old necklace
The one I snuck from the fucked Abbess
Whose dirty little secret, other than me
Now shone with bold intensity

Vast the power it possessed
The darkness Brought to living flesh

This treasure was ancient, taken by force
From an elite caste of priests in Delphi
The Templars were patient, they stayed out the course
Then fleeced their Greek hosts in their sleep

That necklace traversed
Vile murders and miles worse
But what was a curse
To this perverse demoness?

Legend swore it was a gift of malice
For the maiden Harmonia
The illegitimate spawn of love arid war
Jealousy made it gleam for her
For with it clasped, her looking glass
Was ever beautiful and young
But disaster choked her royal caste
And every throat on which it hung
There madness, death and horror clung

Immortalised in mortal guise
She was a sight for blighted eyes
A plague to gladly plagiarise
And spread like red excited kisses

She was more than me
More than words
Could fulfil in the parlance of the angels
She cast a spell on every cell
In my nobody
She gave me back my tongue
That she might run it on herself

She was Lilith. she was light
I was but a parasite
Beckoned to temptation
In her velvet overtones
Through frozen antics, dressed in white
She led me into paradise
Neath comets in ovation
Like the Queen of winter, throned...

Pleasures archetypal
Then much rarer agonies
I was a sworn disciple
Of her whims and dark decrees

In Europe's hair
Her spies were everywhere
A sylph amongst the filthy rich and debonair
Her greater plan
All chaos and the all of man
For as she fed dark appetites
She bred her children there

The spawn of love and war

Presiding over Hellfire clubs
Arch-masons and Agharta

The spawn of love and war

She rode the beast. her legs apart
A blazing pyre starter

Life's playground elated, such dizzying sights
And sensations ignited her grin
As slaves celebrated her Satanic rites
We climbed up to heaven in sin

She came to me
As she will come to You
Intoxicating in her seduction
Her siren sway. devastating voodoo

Persistent, resistance is useless, fool
To this Goddess, in lust she's cruel

Beyond any measure, her pleasures will found
A perverted Eden on sacred ground

vast the power I caressed
The darkness brought to vivid flesh
And in it she now rules a cowered universe


9. Harlot On A Pedestal

Where does the madness end?
How far down do the rungs expire
In smoke and burning heat?
In depravity and sin?

In her shocking retinue
I saw the worst
Desire run amok amongst you
And in her boudoir too
The endless nights embedded
In her beautiful cocoon
Turning black and blue and jaded

Kneelin at her feet
My heart atrophied at her ravishing form
The ultimate test
Her cult obsessed
With this body of the Goddess reborn

When she first laid me to rest
I saw such sights of wickedness
From this harlot on a pedestal
This scarlet Woman scorned

I glimpsed desertion, the bluster of shame
The tribes of the moon. their lustre improved
A morbid aversion to the limpid domain
Of Eden and Adam her dark temper moved

I witnessed reverie then
Perverse resurgence, souls on fire
Blood and seed spilt for centuries
For this imperious bitch

In her shocking retinue
I saw the worst
Desire run amok amongst you
A gnawer of taboo
Dread appetites were threaded
Right throughout the mortal zoo
Her immortality now hungered

I remember, in Thebes
Enthroned with cat-skinned girls
Her long dark hair braided with pearls

A red gown split revealed her thighs
As full lips rose to feline eyes
Egyptian black outlined each lid
It's clear who owned the pyramid

Temptress Lilith
Her beauty stirred me more than words
Could ever paint, her bible hurt

Tempered Lilith
Hissing in the dark
Pissing on my heart
I was missing every part of Victoria

Victoria

I found them hypnotic, the years of display
Of court life and parties, political bite
Narcotic, erotic, her bleary soirees
Left daylight a dream in the scheme of the night

The scheme of the night

But I grew uneasy, she wanted the earth
For now she was spinning her sins
Breeding fell children and hiding her worth
Before the new orders disorder begins

Feeding from the weak
Savaged on their feet by her ravaging lust
Evening-dressed
This young Countess
Led lovers astray under cover of dusk

When she took them to her breast
They passed last rites, deliciousness
Swept into their every pore
This matriarch of darkness bored

Harlot on a pedestal
The night orchestral
Harlot on a pedestal
Never vestal...


10. Forgive Me Father (I Have Sinned)

Forgive me Father, I have sinned
Darkness put her painted claws in me again
Her vision drowns like service wine
Whispered kisses so divine
I was blessed but now I've come undone

Storm clouds roll out overhead
Above their master
End of all flesh, end of all days
Love predicts disaster
In her precious ways

I was burned, a sacerdotal soul
By the Demon Queen of my dreams
Infatuation turned to total control
Her rose was sweet
But her thorns were barbarous

"Love me
And worship me
I'll lavish you and ravish you
Fulfil all wishes and fetishes too

Many never want to see
Many never want to know
The truth behind their fantasies
Their deepest needs
Let alone be shown them"

Forgive me Father, I have sinned
Darkness put her painted claws in me again
Her vision drowns like service wine
Whispered kisses so divine
I was blessed but now I've come undone

Nothing left to do but run

Sodom rolls out modern death
On casters ever faster
End of all Flesh, End of all Days
The stars predict disaster
In her bastard ways

"Love me
And worship me
I'll nurture you and hurt you too
Fulfil all wishes for my sad Aladdin"

She comes to me
Like a sandstorm in an hourglass
A whirlwind of desire
I am hypnotised
To think beyond the pale
Beyond heart-stopping eyes
And sopping thighs
I'm won't to fail

A wicked spell cast over me
Addicted to her utterly
Despite the horrors that gestate
Beneath the beautiful

"I'll grant you life beyond your ken
The envy of all other men
Whatever vice will make you spend
Eternity with me"

Satan's concubine
She makes her crime scenes shine from heaven

Forgive me Father, I have sinned
Darkness put her painted claws in me again
Her vision drowns like service wine
Whispered kisses so divine
I was blessed but now I've come undone


11. Beyond Eleventh Hour

"All mirrors lead to my palace
My exotic pleasure temple
Wherein my court is both gracious and insatiable
Pure and obscene
For where pumps the true heart of life
There too seeps corruption
And from this my new Eden of nightshades, black
henbane, sphinxes,
opium and roses weaned on tears and blood
Will rise up like lust
And the shadow of my dark consort shalt extend
Himself across the face of the world...

...And Hell will come with Him"

Part of the garden, her dark Eden
Fed blood by poisoned fronds
My heart hardened in her wet season
Treading mud in her slough of despond
But only now
A path lies straight before me
The maze is ploughed half through with hate
Andpher crop is dripping red

Beyond eleventh hour

Her beauty and brute power
Grows stronger by the day
And with each rose that she deflowers
The longer her throes of madness stay

In her grip on shredded sheets
Once our fingertips had dug and clutched
She whispered dreadful things to me

She wanted war with God
The underdog baring sharpened teeth
With her armies raised from suffering
To ascend on jet black wings

She'd break off holy limbs
On the racks of her witch hunt
And crush the church beneath her heel
The Pope in homage to her cunt

A dark horse forcing nightmares
To wring submissives dry
A vampire madam batterfang
With vicious streaks a mile wide

Beyond eleventh hour

Her kiss has turned dismissive
Her glance holds slight contempt
Instead those eyes burn on the prize
Of fates she really likes to tempt

In her grip on shredded sheets
Gasping from conquered peaks of passion
She whispered dreadful things to me

She wanted war with God
The underdog baring sharpened teeth
With her armies raised from suffering
To ascend on jet black wings

She'd tear down mighty spires
Then rear them up anew
Orders forged to her desires
The eleventh hour nearly through

Lilith, the abyss, the slithering mists
That cause all souls to stray
How to resist those seductive gifts
On the shore of her unholy ways?

She calls my name so softly
From deep banks of scented fog
I almost lose myself before it starts
But my spirit keeps its silence
As I drift across the lake
A glimpse of harem secrets
Now her velvet curtain parts

She is glaring like the moon

The wind dies down. eavesdropping
As I bow before her throne
And she descends to greet me
Like the royal bitch to which shes grown

"Come closer, what have you to say?
Black cat got your tongue?

"I am not your slave
Nor are you my saviour"

"But Isaac, I'm the only one..."

I hold those cold deceiving eyes
Her once hypnotic gaze
And pledge eternal love. then walk away
Thunder seethes behind me
Death adjusts her favourite mask
Another lover smothered by her sanguinary darkness

Clasped in the garden, here you heard
This story blustered through
I asked her pardon, swore my word
I'd score her sweetmeats just like you

For only now
The truth lies prone before me
I couldn't leave her even if she stormed
The heavens as were promised

Beyond eleventh hour

Lilith, the abyss. the slithering mists
Will come for you this eve
Lustrous the cusp of her lingering tryst
Before those fatal kisses bleed

Beyond eleventh hour

She will make of you a plaything
Scant amusement for her bed
And when naked flesh forgets to sing
She'll take your fucking soul instead

Midnight strikes, the candles sputter
Muttering their reeking spells
I snuff their tongues, my heart a-flutter
These words I speak are gates to Hell


12. Beast Of Extermination

"Kill a man and you are a murderer.
Kill millions of men and you are a conqueror.
Kill everyone and you are a God."

Born of the best of enemies
Beyond the pearly constellations
Wherein heaven has no embassy
And hope no surly grip on reason

Yahweh: frankincense
Satan; gold and murder

He is sly, bejewelled with sylph
Slick limbs spread wide to guide you through the filth
And rust
Crawl to him fuelled by lust

He's the horned one in the pentagram
A waste of chaos by the gram
Dark eyes for trouble, double damned
Despair
The storm upon lake Lacrymose
Restless. never comatose
The thorn upon the single rose
We share...

Germination

His a renegade a Capella now obeyed
A shitstorm without warning
The pleasuit King In Yellow on parade
Son of the thunderous morning

Yahweh: frankincense
Satan: gold and murder

He is high. inured with vice
The tower-cree er on our edelweiss
Career
A foreign power cut of utter fear

Taught curiosity, he s atrocity. banned
The taste of chaos by the dram
A tortured course like slaughtered lamb
Best rare
The curse that haunts this thirsting tomb
Disturbed, becomes the worst of doom
Rehearsing all his worth for soon
He's there...

Extermination

He is hatred. greed and war
He is everything we ought abhor
Were it not for the fateful truth
Be sure
We suffer him all the more

And lo! his tyrant's eye
Is fixed upon our rich and vibrant sky
Now hear the wind
Herald desolation

As on that eve when angels clad
In nothing but their whispered virtues
Slipped into the valley
Of the dirty serpentine

Hes the horned one in the pentagram
A waste of chaos by the gram
Dark eyes for trouble, double damned
Despair
The storm upon lake Lacrymose
Restless, never comatose
The thorn u on the single rose
we share...

Desperation

Disdainful. he self-deprecates
The mirror's jagged stare
And it's painful how we subjugate
The grinning face reflected in there

Yahweh: frankincense
Satan; gold and murder


13. Truth And Agony

Mother's milk has soured
My life's a bolted door
And from it runs a trail of vagrant gore
My wounds are open flowers
Fragrant gifts for my encore
Bouquets of praise for bleeding, towered
On the sacrificial floor

I summoned and you came
To the peel of twisted bells
To the gelid whisper of my name

I blanched, erotic danger
Had me whirling like a star
To the dark advance of strangers

And then I heard you laugh
A throat of broken glass
Leather stitched to weeping skin
A coat of death and suppuration

Be my truth and agony

An architect for my total destruction
My erector, my dissector
My flesh will be wet for your best seduction

Be my truth and agony
inventive and deranged
Loves proof is in, its plain to see
The fluids we've exchanged

Part of these soul killers
The Gestapohood of scars
Carved an ornate invitation on my heart
The scent of French vanilla
With the stench of abattoirs
Past tense of present laythings
On those stained red lips ajar

I summoned and you came
From the churning guts of Hell
With your Christmas hiss of chains

Down the endless centuries
Your torture bed of lust
A shrine for us to redesign
And sign in blood and rust

Be my truth and agony
An architect for my total destruction
My erector, my dissector
My flesh caressed by your best corruption

Be my truth and agony
inventive and deranged
Loves roof is in, its meant to be
My cells are rearranged

I suffered and you came
To the splintering of bones
Winning pinnacles for my pain

Raped and racked and mutilated
I Raised from dregs again
Autopsy-turvy, back elated
In brazen arms that sacked my veins

Skinnatra, take me to the stars
Thrust me through to paradise
Endorphins breaking fast

Creature from the black abyss
Teacher. sadomasochist
Your tortured soul has led me
To this altered state of bliss


14. Adest Rosa Secreta Eros

My number is 11, as all their numbers who are of us.
My colour is black to the blind, but the blue & gold are seen of the seeing.
Also I have a secret glory for them that love me.
But to love me is better than all things:
if under the night stars in the desert thou presently burnest mine incense before me,
invoking me with a pure heart, and the Serpent flame therein,
thou shalt come a little to lie in my bosom.

For one kiss wilt thou then be willing to give all;
but whoso gives one particle of dust shall lose all in that hour.

Ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall exceed the nations of the earth in spendour & pride;
but always in the love of me, and so ye shall come to my joy.
I love you! I yearn to you! Pale or purple, veiled or voluptuous,
I who am all pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of the innermost sense, desire you.
Put on the wings, and arouse the coiled splendour within you: come unto me!

I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge & Delight and bright glory, and stir the hearts of men with drunkenness.
To worship me take wine and strange drugs whereof I will tell my prophet, & be drunk thereof! They shall not harm ye at all. It is a lie, this folly against self.
The exposure of innocence is a lie.

Be strong, o man! lust, enjoy all things of sense and rapture: fear not that any God shall deny thee for this.

Let the Scarlet Woman beware! If pity and compassion and tenderness visit her heart;
if she leave my work to toy with old sweetnesses; then shall my vengeance be known.
I will slay me her child: I will alienate her heart: I will cast her out from men: as a shrinking and despised harlot shall she crawl through dusk wet streets, and die cold and an-hungered.

But let her raise herself in pride! Let her follow me in my way! Let her work the work of wickedness! Let her kill her heart! Let her be loud and adulterous! Let her be covered with jewels, and rich garments, and let her be shameless before all men!

Then will I lift her to pinnacles of power: then will I breed from her a child mightier


15. Mistress From The Sucking Pit

Oh dear God
It is midnight in the labyrinth

The night is set to taint the painted halls
Moonlight is our cue
The candelabra flicker at your passing gall
I swear they're dancing just for you
The dead leaves rustle on the manor lawns
As a light breeze whispers through
The call of wolves. the owls lament
Our screams shall soon soar skyward too

Mistress from the sucking pit

All the world crawls lovesick at her feet
The stars are passing observations
Her voice is music, her legs go on
Shes got full orchestration
And been known to use it
But trepidation is a far slicker song

Amongst dull suitors
She is bright and razor sharp
A tree of woe uprooter
A viper still at heart

Shes alkaline and far acidic
As sweet as clementines
This mistress from the sucking pit

All the world crawls lovesick at her feet
The stars are passing observations
Her voice is music, her legs go on
Shes got full orchestration
And been known to use it
But trepidation is a far slicker song

Mistress from the sucking pit

Embossed by her postulant gaze
Like Medusa on a plinth
I am lost in her embrace
Oh dear God
It is midnight in the labyrinth

A peacock fan of sinful eyes
Swim wide across the room
This night, espied, your thin disguise
Does wonders for the sundered gloom
For all lit up the shades retreat
To dark Italian pews
And corners where great vases stand
Abrim with thoughts of naked dais with you

Mistress from the sucking pit

All the world crawls lovesick at her feet
The stars are passing observations
Her needs are dire, her rites are wrong
She burns with exultation
Like a fiery vampire
For desperation is a far slicker song

Amongst dull suitors
She's bright and razor sharp
A tree of woe uprooter
A viper still at heart

She's alkaline and far acidic
Fluidic, serpentine
This mistress from the sucking pit

The waiters pass in gilded frames
With glasses sparkling too
The ball tonight rows magical
Like the finest Venice threw
And at it's heart a mythic queen
Her skin of purest hue
Whose beauty is unquestionable
But whose duties are askew
For beneath the airs and divine graces
A slim tornado whirls
On the precipice of her poisonous kiss
The devil dwells deep inside this girl

Embossed by her postulant gaze
Like Medusa on a plinth
I am lost in her embrace
Oh dear God
It is midnight in the labyrinth

Mistress from the sucking pit

The wine has sat and breathed it's last
In blood red ruby where
I find you by the roaring hearth
A blaze of golden hair
Cascading down an angel's face
To pool about the breasts
That man minds have wondered on
but only I caress
And then I'm yours. the velvet crown
Of Venus in my hands
Fists rip hard the eiderdown
Desire firebrands
Every mountain, every route
My wanton tongue must take
To taste that once forbidden fruit
Before your bloodlust starts to...


16. Behind The Jagged Mountains

I have come from the freezing seas
From the warmth of foreign coals
Through the dismal fog of insecurities
To a cloud-enshrouded noble goal

The world has cast me from its laughter
Thrown to the wolves, to the dread thereafter

So now I forge a journey fraught
Through these bitter wastes of snow
Over ice and gorge to an Eden sought
Far from the human races afterglow

This sightless climb is treacherous to weather
As the cold bites deep, old heartstrings sever

Behind the jagged mountains
Beyond the frozen North
At the back of Boreas. The zealous wind
There crest celestial fountains
Crystal waters soaring forth
In the realm of our sacred Angelus kin

Neither muse nor music flees
This garden of delights
Everywhere the soothing hands of nature please
In this state of pure Euphoria

Paradise lies at the heart of darkness
And one must pay for this deep catharsis

Now the storm-clouds retch
A vision fleets before my eyes
Wherein minarets and spires touch
Phantasmagoric skies
And meadows stretch to woodlands
Of sweet nymph and fireflies

Death is in the breeze
And his mind will paralyse

My mind is in the clutch
Of something too long fantasised

Behind the jagged mountains
Beyond the frozen peaks
At the back of Boreas, the zealous wind
The Gods of love are counting
Down the nights until we meet
In the realm of oursacred Angelus kin

Now the mirage blears
And the howling gusts renew their fury
The gleam of moonlit towers
Fades to utter fear

The mountains rear in anger
At the righteousness I lack
And in their monstrous grasp I know
Dear God
They will never let me back...

Free of enemies, no death, disease
The doves of peace, in flight
Carouse upon the ever-Summer breeze
In this land of Hyperborea

Behind the jagged mountains
Beyond their icy stares
At the back of Boreas, the zealous wind
My soul is now surmounting
Past the grasp of last despairs
To the realm of our sacred Angelus kin

Behind the jagged mountains
Beyond the frozen North

17. The Cult Of Venus Aversa

18. The Nun With The Astral Habit

19. Deceiving Eyes 
1. Transmission From Hell

So, I've got a clean copy of the tape
Here now and um,
Well look I should warn you that
This could really scare you.

This is the letter that I received
From one (inaudible)...that was
Dated the 6th of june of 2006.
I have recently started
(inaudible)...to believe it
When you talked about
The sounds from hell tonight.

My uncle had told me this story
A couple of years ago and i didn't
Believe him, like I discounted the
Stories as nothing more thab just a
Hysterical religious newspaper account.

The story about the digging of the
Hole and the hearing of the sounds
From hell is very real. It did occur,
In Siberia on a regular mining
Expedition exploring future oil reserves.

My uncle collected video and audio
Tapes and so forth, on the
Paranormal and supernatural.
Until he passed away recently
Under strange, terrible circunstances.
He let me listen to one of the audio tapes
That he had on the sounds from hell
In Siberia and I (inaudible)...

He received his version from a
Close friend who worked (inaudible)...
It took me awhile to find it tonight,
But attached is that sound from my
Uncle's tapes. It's not the (inaudible)...
But the sounds, those horrible sounds on there.

I was very hesitant to send you this
Because the noise bothers me to listen to.
It has always....haunted me.

To those who discounted the
"Saberian Sounds From Hell" story, it
Is true. And I, for one, wish it wasn't.
Well, that's the letter, and this is the tape.
Its clean better copy and I will warn you...
...what you are about to hear is
VERY VERY DISTURBING.


2. Thank Your Lucky Scars

Governed by the moon
She's a bold headmistress
I am lycanthropic
Too evolved to miss this
Opportunity to taste
The pausing lamb
By the grace of heaven
Come the claws
I am
Emerging with the hunger
Scented blood a tease
Urges surging under
Thunder bludgeoning pleas
Bathing in the afterglow
Of Set let free
On the scarlet march of woe
To a dead set destiny

True nature's stark decree
The crude dripping whipping
Off the back of need

We are lost souls amok
The raptors, scratch, Ragnarok
The crossed pounding holy flock
Like a werewolf blitzkrieg

I am stuck on a killing spree
A premature star
That shot reprieve
So fuck you Lady sympathy
Just thank your lucky scars
You're not for me

The moon is drifting
through a dark hypnotic garden
Her spells are waxing gibbous
And my heart it starts to roar

Just thank your lucky scars

Sat astride my rearing nightmares
The abhorrence King. Death bound in glory
I see their idle tide in fear now turn there
Before these evil jaws that leave no story

This rancour soon will pass
Just thank your lucky scars

Chosen by the moon
She's a cold seductress
Frozen to the bone
She's compelled to suck this
Lust from out my veins
To assert her rule
From the able mouth of Cain
Spurt the things I do

Howling at the ether
Like a beast in heat
Burning with a fever
For the seasonal meat
I shall never gloat
On what the sufferer sees
My teeth are in their throat
Blood is draining me of speech

True nature's stark decree
The brute, finger licking
From his sickening feats

We are lost souls amok
The raptors, scratch, Ragnarok
The crossed, pounding holy flock
Like a werewolf blitzkrieg

I am stuck on a killing spree
A premature star
That shot reprieve
So fuck you Lady sympathy
Just thank your lucky scars
Your not like me

Just thank your lucky scars

Sat astride my rearing nightmares
The abhorrence King. Death bound in glory
I see their idle tide in fear now turn there
Before these haunted shores of purgatory

Just thank your lucky scars

Governed by the moon
She's a bold headmistress
I am lycanthropic
Too evolved to miss this
Opportunity to taste
The pausing lamb
By the grace of heaven
Come the claws
I am
Emerging with the hunger
Scented blood a tease
Urges surging under
Thunder bludgeoning pleas
Bathing in the afterglow
Of Set let free
On the scarlet march of woe
To a dead set destiny


3. Forgive Me Father (I Have Sinned)

Forgive me Father, I have sinned
Darkness put her painted claws in me again
Her vision drowns like service wine
Whispered kisses so divine
I was blessed but now I've come undone

Storm clouds roll out overhead
Above their master
End of all flesh, end of all days
Love predicts disaster
In her precious ways

I was burned, a sacerdotal soul
By the Demon Queen of my dreams
Infatuation turned to total control
Her rose was sweet
But her thorns were barbarous

"Love me
And worship me
I'll lavish you and ravish you
Fulfil all wishes and fetishes too

Many never want to see
Many never want to know
The truth behind their fantasies
Their deepest needs
Let alone be shown them"

Forgive me Father, I have sinned
Darkness put her painted claws in me again
Her vision drowns like service wine
Whispered kisses so divine
I was blessed but now I've come undone

Nothing left to do but run

Sodom rolls out modern death
On casters ever faster
End of all Flesh, End of all Days
The stars predict disaster
In her bastard ways

"Love me
And worship me
I'll nurture you and hurt you too
Fulfil all wishes for my sad Aladdin"

She comes to me
Like a sandstorm in an hourglass
A whirlwind of desire
I am hypnotised
To think beyond the pale
Beyond heart-stopping eyes
And sopping thighs
I'm won't to fail

A wicked spell cast over me
Addicted to her utterly
Despite the horrors that gestate
Beneath the beautiful

"I'll grant you life beyond your ken
The envy of all other men
Whatever vice will make you spend
Eternity with me"

Satan's concubine
She makes her crime scenes shine from heaven

Forgive me Father, I have sinned
Darkness put her painted claws in me again
Her vision drowns like service wine
Whispered kisses so divine
I was blessed but now I've come undone


4. Lilith Immaculate

Church bells resounded like judgement day
As they were making love
In the rainswept graveyard
She fucked him hard, silhouetted by flame
A monsoon Tigress set upon prey

Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more master the faster the days

Lilith Immaculate

This delectable reaper
Her eyes were profound
Drawing him in deeper
Until he was drowned
Hurled on the shore
Of the world underground...

Lilith Immaculate

Mortal kind, a morbid wine
For this dark moon goddess
And freed to stretch her claws
This beautiful whore
Would be brutally honest

Tortuous one, taboos undone
A glittering star on a sea of myriad waves
And a thickening mist, a seductress
Leading lovesick hearts astray

Lilith

In the throes of orgasm, she bucked and he broke
At the height of the storm, the chaos they'd smote
Burning behind her in arabesque smoke
Framed a vision transformed as she sucked from his throat

Victoria smiled, her now golden eyes
Possessed a regal bearing
Of omnipotent power
From wet lips to her smouldering thighs
Her beauty perfected and her will agonised

Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more the master the faster the days

Lilith Immaculate

With dread single purpose
Her mind told him stay
She strode through the fire
Desire aflame
She murdered the nuns
In such horrible ways...

Lilith Immaculate

"That night we lay entwined on hay
Inside a soldier's barn
Her panting breath an opiate
As in her bolder grasp
I caught the scent of desert sands
The Holy lands, the fall of reason
But only when I smelt the blood
Did I fear her colder hand"

"I am darkness, I am sin
The Queen of lust invited in
Reborn at last to cast my
Fecund shadow on this world,
You shall worship me, enslaved
For many lovers shall I crave
And in return, I'll gladly pave
Your psycho path with pearls

For I have been grating
And waiting so long to find
The most perfect hostess close to me
Whose thin-ice troubled mind
Was like a cracked, black ornate mirror
To slip right through in time
When at last I wore Harmonia's necklace
The cursed twin serpents mine"

Tortuous one, debauchery won
The attention of Emperors, Princes and Tsars
For the toll of her kiss, no soul could dismiss
The advance of her throne from afar

This English rose with traits of those
Who graced the harems of the East
Adorned with thorns, she raised the horns
And scarlet hems to wasted priests

Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more master the faster the days

Lilith Immaculate

This delectable reaper
Her eyes were profound
They drew him in deeper
Until he was drowned
Hurled on the shore
Of the world underground...

Lilith Immaculate

Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more master the faster the days

Lilith Immaculate

The flutes and sweet wine
Of her voice anodyne
Her power was growing
Every hour malign
The truth, Lilith's kingdom
Drew closer with time


5. The Persecution Song - Elder Version

At the very start
There were whispers in the dark
And for all the world to see
There was witchcraft at its heart
And on the autumn air
The scent of bonfires everywhere
And a fell wind stirred the leaves...

The persecution song

Telltale signs of possession
Little Miss Demeanour in the demons bed
Gasps she just could not suppress
After lights-out midst the dead
And a past on which sin cast its darts of wickedness

Time was running faster for disaster
Strange nights were burning
In the furnace of her dreams
A name was uttered, Lilith
Mistress, playmate, master
Such sights were stolen in the throes of ecstasy

And in the thick of all
In the Black Goddess's thrall
With the wood unseen for trees
Victoria stood tall
Promiscuous in step
The Devil breathing down her neck
As jealous zealots stitched apiece...

The persecution song

Telltale signs of possession
Fickle Miss Demeanour hissed and disappeared
To her Sisters of the cloth
She now reeked of Astaroth
Again the curse had surfaced
Sneaking back the pagan years

Weaving webs of great revealing
Hidden in the convent
An evil libido abided, undone
Breathing, deceiving
Feasting on her deviant feelings
She'd clung to her crucifix
Once her torturers begun

Her screams came quick
The miserichord
Den to vice and screw
That had reddened many tongues
Wrung symphonies
Of suffering from her

Many moons hardened pure hearts
Those plagued by her black arts
Their rooms secreting phantom orgies
Vile rites and rifled graves

Mere hours, now towered
Above this bent and beaten flower
Her naked body privy to
The Abbess and her ways

Victoria fought
No guilt was wrought
Just a torrid retort of blasphemies
Nails and crosses vomited forth
From this pretty little whore now arched like Hell

Arched like Hell

At the very start
There were whispers in the dark
And for all the world to see
There was witchcraft at its heart
But then the end grew nigh
A dirge inferno filled the sky
In its customary key...

The persecution song

Telltale signs of obsession
No wailing banshee would dishonour their name
Nuns dragged her to the blasted oak
Storm-clouds threatened holy smoke
They hanged her there like Judas
With the Hellcat in her reined

Time was running faster for disaster
Exorcism, torture, gallows
Now a shallow grave
A name was stuttered, Isaac
Tongue-tied, simple, bastard
They made him dig the pit
Mindless of what it claimed


6. Forgive Me Father (I'm In A Trance)

Forgive me Father, I have sinned

Forgive me Father, I have sinned
Darkness put her painted claws in me again
Her vision drowns like service wine
Whispered kisses so divine
I was blessed but now I've come undone

Storm clouds roll out overhead
Above their master
End of all flesh, end of all days
Love predicts disaster
In her precious ways

I was burned, a sacerdotal soul
By the Demon Queen of my dreams
Infatuation turned to total control
Her rose was sweet
But her thorns were barbarous

"Love me
And worship me
I'll lavish you and ravish you
Fulfil all wishes and fetishes too

Many never want to see
Many never want to know
The truth behind their fantasies
Their deepest needs
Let alone be shown them"

Forgive me Father, I have sinned
Darkness put her painted claws in me again
Her vision drowns like service wine
Whispered kisses so divine
I was blessed but now I've come undone

Nothing left to do but run

Sodom rolls out modern death
On casters ever faster
End of all Flesh, End of all Days
The stars predict disaster
In her bastard ways

"Love me
And worship me
I'll nurture you and hurt you too
Fulfil all wishes for my sad Aladdin"

She comes to me
Like a sandstorm in an hourglass
A whirlwind of desire
I am hypnotised
To think beyond the pale
Beyond heart-stopping eyes
And sopping thighs
I'm won't to fail

A wicked spell cast over me
Addicted to her utterly
Despite the horrors that gestate
Beneath the beautiful

"I'll grant you life beyond your ken
The envy of all other men
Whatever vice will make you spend
Eternity with me"

Satan's concubine
She makes her crime scenes shine from heaven

Forgive me Father, I have sinned
Darkness put her painted claws in me again
Her vision drowns like service wine
Whispered kisses so divine
I was blessed but now I've come undone

7. The Spawn Of Love And War - Elder Version

Poets racking absinthed brains
Could never fully paint these nights
No martyr parting from his pain
Could utter words so erudite
As those she now divulged to me
In throes of passions grip
Indulging latent fantasies
That ran forked tongues along the lip

Of fate's pudenda
The twisted snake's agenda
Now the world would bend
To her deadly legacy

Life's graveyard was waiting, such dizzying flight
From the convent at All Hallows Fair
Without contemplating, we fled through the night
Too blood-drunk and cunt-sated to care

The Goddess had spoken
And woken desire
It crackled in the air around us
A psychic force shimmering like fire

And on her breasts. that old necklace
The one I snuck from the fucked Abbess
Whose dirty little secret, other than me
Now shone with bold intensity

Vast the power it possessed
The darkness Brought to living flesh

This treasure was ancient, taken by force
From an elite caste of priests in Delphi
The Templars were patient, they stayed out the course
Then fleeced their Greek hosts in their sleep

That necklace traversed
Vile murders and miles worse
But what was a curse
To this perverse demoness?

Legend swore it was a gift of malice
For the maiden Harmonia
The illegitimate spawn of love arid war
Jealousy made it gleam for her
For with it clasped, her looking glass
Was ever beautiful and young
But disaster choked her royal caste
And every throat on which it hung
There madness, death and horror clung

Immortalised in mortal guise
She was a sight for blighted eyes
A plague to gladly plagiarise
And spread like red excited kisses

She was more than me
More than wards
Could fulfil in the parlance of the angels
She cast a spell on every cell
In my nobody
She gave me back my tongue
That she might run it on herself

She was Lilith. she was light
I was but a parasite
Beckoned to temptation
In her velvet overtones
Through frozen antics, dressed in white
She led me into paradise
Neath comets in ovation
Like the Queen of winter, throned...

Pleasures archetypal
Then much rarer agonies
I was a sworn disciple
Of her whims and dark decrees

In Europe's hair
Her spies were everywhere
A sylph amongst the filthy rich and debonair
Her greater plan
All chaos and the all of man
For as she fed dark appetites
She bred her children there

The spawn of love and war

Presiding over Hellfire clubs
Arch-masons and Agharta

The spawn of love and war

She rode the beast. her legs apart
A blazing pyre starter

Life's playground elated, such dizzying sights
And sensations ignited her grin
As slaves celebrated her Satanic rites
We climbed up to heaven in sin

She came to me
As she will come to You
Intoxicating in her seduction
Her siren sway. devastating voodoo

Persistent, resistance is useless, fool
To this Goddess, in lust she's cruel

Beyond any measure, her pleasures will found
A perverted Eden on sacred ground

vast the power I caressed
The darkness brought to vivid flesh
And in it she now rules a cowered universe

8. Summer Dying Fast

1. Walpurgis Eve

2. Yours Immortally…

Bedight, this pre-aestival
Festival drew darkly near
And our delight at its arrival
Was a roar to rival loosed Fenrir

Let the Hellish celebrations begin
Ragnarok is rolling, magma abrim
The blackest mass the Brocken has ever seen
Invoking Loki, smoking the red weed

We listen to the Glorification
Of Chernobog in a fog of elation
Denial is the vilest form of blasphemy

Standing on the cliffs that kiss burning winds
We are risen together
Brazen, exalting, a hiss of triumph rings
I am yours
...Yours immortally

Tonight the rites are right for raising spirits on
The Devil's Pulpit, The Witches Altar
The dead will dance macabre
To Chaos Magick psalters

A heavy thunder shadowing lightning
Forged for Judgement Day
Announces greater wonder, citing
Heralds on the starry way

And I held you like St Vitus
As the Sabbat leapt to play
Before the fever swelled to bite us
And we were swept to waylay
May Day

Standing on the cliffs that kiss burning winds
We are risen together
Brazen, exalting, a hiss of triumph rings
I am yours
...Yours immortally

Only those tortured
Could profess such festive scenes
And melodies
Of raucous wrought debauchery

No arthritic, sullen Goya
For this fresh Walpurgis Eve
Our flesh it breathes
Full of fantastic symphonies

Witness the fires reflected in infernal eyes
That blaze, alive
Eternal ties
Have trussed amazing lusts together

Procession, banquet, black mass, orgy

If our world were to cease right now
In the midst of this
Wide naked bliss, these stated sacred vows
I would break the universe in two
Just to side with you
To face the jealous heavens down

Excite the terse miscarriage
Of first light that thirsts to slay
This night versed with the marriage
Of you and I
And all who dare to stray


3. Enshrined In Crematoria

This night is chilled by ghosts
And the woods are full of werewolves
My heart is pounding with the stars
I feel the darkness rising

I'm blessed, addressed
By a voice of sweet caresses
Intoxication feeds
This freed reality
My inspiration speaks
Enshrined in crematoria

A sight of winged delight
Two great cherubim abreast her
Encase her grave, like once I prayed
Upon her sacred chest there

None more tragic for the lovelorn addict
Than the death of a beautiful girl

Although I was the author of sin
That compelled her wings to furl
She represents the pleasant scent
Of asphodel in this wretched world

Moonlight
Announce the presence of God again
The Ark of the Tragedian
Glitters like bright Hittite treasure

At best, obsessed
By her loss and my excesses
Judgementalism heaped
Upon the mercy seat
Means nothing to her sleep
Enshrined in crematoria

The trees are gaunt
But the cemetery beckons
Before her marble colonnades
I feel a stirring in the temple

As Israel waited with bated breath
At the foot of Mount Sinai
So I sated my wait for death
And miracles from on high
In wine and finite poetry
As fires bathed the sky

Moonlight
Announce the presence of God again
The Ark of the Tragedian
Church to her virgin measure

My tethered heart, a sacrificial lamb
Thrashes madly as the Lioness approaches

Moonlight
Announce the presence of God again
The Ark of the Tragedian
Is built on biblical pleasures

Poe-esque, grotesque
In my need for this catharsis
Her dark commandments teach
Through my prolific reach
A taste so bittersweet
Enshrined in crematoria

I find phantasmagoria
Enshrined in crematoria


4. Deflowering The Maidenhead, Displeasuring The Goddess

Cracked Mirrors scatter reflection
Beauty falls from Her state of perfection
Good grace has fled this dream
While the cat's away the rats will ravage

Despotic, Necrotic fingers
Have lingered with Rape's Affection
Hoods face this global scene
As they stoop to prey nature grows more savage

She shudders at our foetal, fatal touch
Heavenly her body reft and left amongst the dead
Once grateful seeds in Her natal hutch
Our species breeds, deflowering the maidenhead

Religions caw epistles
Twisted laws extend their thistles
A crown to justify
Our place atop this hellbound carriage

This judgment has come from on high
Deforesters pray to the amplified sky
Stripped of her gowns, temples ripped down
Her curses hearse NOW
This judgment has come from on high
Look to her spears with true fear in your eyes

Summoning the coven, The Four Horsemen, Eschaton
She, the sumptuous Earth deep scars were forced upon
Queen Catastrophia seer renewal grew to see
Humanity in ruins sped to Death on rotten knees

We freed the flames that came to haunt Her
The greed that tore Her Elvish bodice

She was the storm that warmed to slaughter
Our selfish needs displeasuring the Goddess

Plastering disasters, faster pandemics appear
Anthropocentric pockets, last plagues are spreading near
Grand levelling with seven tongues acerbic, whore-astride
As the oceans swell in venom at our slick black ecocide

This judgment has come from on high
Poisoners choke on the smoke-ridden Sty
Forewarnings ignored, faith in a Lord
Life's blessings uncared for
This judgment has come from on high
Suffer this Kiss as She whispers goodbye

Goodbye

What have we done?
And what have we become
In this distance from our Mother
From the gates of late Eden?

Blinded, undone
Glowering into the sun
A world of mass congestion smothered
In the waste of late Eden

and what of Her?
Gaia, Cybele
where is jewelled Ishtar
That shone forth like the stars?

Now maniacal
Now maniacal She moves against us all
To destroy, recreate anew
To dance amok amidst annihilation

Extinction greets foul creatures left
Deflowering the Maidenhead
Displeasuring the Goddess


5. Blackest Magick In Practice

I wish upon a star
And think of all the things
I should have asked
Instead, I let the moment pass
And now I'm bleeding
On her faded photographs

Tears
So hard to swallow
Sorrow blears and leaves me hollow
Empty years, I should have followed
My inamorata to the grave

Uncertain words my heart denied
Now seem so trivial
I lost it all the night she died

Lies!
She is alive!
Beneath the ice
Only darkest mirrors crack this
Curse
And I, immersed
Invoke the worst
Blackest Magick put to practice

I remember then
When the Autumn moon
Would turn us back again
We'd laugh and bask
Amidst the underworld of men
Both citing Baudelaire
As our immoral saviour

Tears
So hard to swallow
Sorrow blears and leaves me hollow
Empty years, I should have followed
My inamorata to the grave

Words are so benumbing
In my head, I hear the drumming
Summoning, the dead are coming
From fetid crypts my lips create

Now grave powers start to rise
Deflowerers shall suffer
And witness to your sacrifice

Lies!
She is alive!
Beneath the ice
Only darkest mirrors crack this
Curse
And I, immersed
Invoke the worst
Blackest Magick put to practice

I think upon our time
Those golden summers
Of love echo so sublime
As do winters drinking
Too much festive wine
Now the seasons shift
Neath a creeping mist of horror

Malefic entities
I call upon thee
Vibrating cosmic threads
With shredded flesh
Manifest destinies
For those opposing me
Everyone is killable
Some just choose a vulgar death

Now we will see
What terrors shall be
The dark crimson sea
Drags the sun to oblivion

Faced demons
Arousing fire with tongues
Laced with vicious memories
Spatter twisted trees

Rape is returned a thousandfold
In the garden of unearthly delights

Only when their minds lie in ruin
Will I then hand them the knife

Towers fall like broken skies
Crashing through to Hell
Where amid the debris, angels writhe

Lies!
She is alive!
Beneath the ice
Only darkest mirrors crack this
Curse
And I, immersed
Invoke the worst
Blackest Magick put to practice

Death left me hopelessly blinded
Resigned to the wrongs of his design
I will never be alright
Never be alright
Never see the light
That shone in the heart of heaven


6. The Monstrous Sabbat (Summoning The Coven)

7. Hammer Of The Witches

Breastfed red dementias
Familiar with their suckled hostess
Unhinge her bridle scold
A quest for misadventure
Wrests her glare of buckled gnosis
From bloodstained floor to holy centrefold

Death is tensing to explode

Inquisitioners sought her
Scenting the bent in her veins
Stripped and readied for torture
Enslaved to shame

The fist of humanity taught her
Scissors and spiked tourniquet
Dionysian daughter
Pressed to confess from the pain

I say, "Toll the demon bell
The rotting hearts of Man
Shall light the path from Hell."

Vestal desecrators
Familiar with her secret ewers
Soon tied to licking flame
Rest their 'tests' for later
As sweet revenge from reeking sewers
Uncoils and slides amidst this unfair game

A Storm is rolling in
Unleash the fucking curse...

Striking unbiblical chords that roar
Invoke raw branded skies
As forked lightning feeds the hordes of war
Her broken hands revive

Calling the fallen
Crawling from the shadows of God

Now their fables turn, blind faith learns
Papal sermons oft have lied
Save that the coven the Black Goat governs
Is very much wide-eyed, alive

She summons proof
On virulent wings, a plague is coming
Cuntfire-hoofed
From mating with the Devil
On the torch-lit Brocken

Baphometic by design

A penchant vent for vengeance
Cut deep by horrors fought
Those dungeon-screams for mercy
Shalt keep for everybody

Nine circles down they heard her
Ten times the hecatomb
A thousand souls for those church-murdered
Dark ken align to render doom

Their punishment overdue

For sisters, missed, once powerless
Tongues torn out by the root
Fell whispers rose to a seething congress
Of spirits born for Death's pursuit

Never a dusk so drunk on lust
Caressed the cobbles red
Frights she called, the flights of Ghouls
Left little of their brittle flesh

Judgment night descended
Like the bonfire's fall of ashes

Inquisitioners slaughtered
Venting the dent in her brain
Stripped and readied, debauchers
Prepared to stain

The gist of humanity taught her
Intolerance, murder in vein
Dionysian daugher
Soon to deliver the pain

I say, "Toll the demon bell
The rotting hearts of Man
Shall beat the path to Hell."

And refreshed of this dementia
Their thumbscrews,
Pears and cruel whiplashes
She turns her craft
To the next fat sacred grove


8. Right Wing Of The Garden Triptych

Death darkens all
Right wing of the garden triptych
Left marks The Fall
The middle ground apocalyptic

Why stay the grim inevitable and play out with a whimper?
Fate is raising coming to our faith!
NOW! The future cows!
Before the vows, prophets thunder from the heavens

We seek to justify, our seed spread far and wide
The eve that virtue died bore witness to this plague
Great hellscapes rape enflamed horizons here.....

This is the sore beginning to the war to end all wars
GÖTTERDÄMMERUNG, GÖTTERDÄMMERUNG, this hate brings fever
GÖTTERDÄMMERUNG, GÖTTERDÄMMERUNG, the great bereaver
Throw wide splintered lichgates to the eldritch show's return

Unforgiving proof accrual begs this cruel rebirth
A living fuel for the blaze of renewal razing the earth
Pariahs and messiahs of the highest worth, fodder for the denizens of risen
Hissing hell nothing screams out mercy more than vivisection of the soul

GÖTTERDÄMMERUNG, GÖTTERDÄMMERUNG, all base deceivers
Coddle abaddon, God, you got it wrong, now fall believers!
Liars and deniers, thick in mire's grasp, treacherous and lecherous
Retching a sick bloodbath

Peace sits alone midst the desecration sewn like a stony queen of winter, throned...
This is the penalty for lust- long dreaded, read in scripture, vain pleasures fed to paint this...

NOW! The future cows! Before the vows, prophets thunder from the heavens
We seek to justify, our seed spread far and wide
The eve that virtue died bore witness to this plague
Great hellscapes rape enflamed horizons here.....

GÖTTERDÄMMERUNG, GÖTTERDÄMMERUNG a twilight for bone idols
Sewer-suicidal from the heights, a dead man's stance of prayer
Deafened ears to mortal plight

Pleas and effigies, clergy bang to rites belief is superficial when the missals dance alight

All death darkens all
Right wing of the garden triptych
Left marks the fall
The universe is at worst, ecliptic


9. The Vampyre At My Side

Accompanied by bloodshed
Neath the Reaper's sallow craw
In league with fallen angels
Came a wolf unto my door

A portrait of perfection
Potent her siren song
I spread my dreams beneath her feet
And had them royally pissed upon

Burning with this itching sickness of a tortured soul

Cloying
She exudes a lure more animal than human
Intoxicating chemistry
Baiting masturbators with a dominant handshake

This wicked bitch
Cruella to the bone
Each vivid stich
Just ties me to her throne
In exaltation
She builds on endless lies
Mircalla, Maleresian
Architect of my demise

Burning with this witching sickness of a tortured soul

Toying
I shudder at her touch so wonderful
Akin to a helpless pin
Snatched in maiden flight by a savage magnet

She's the boot heel kiss of annihilation

Gilded cunt worship
A war of hormones swarming south
As Insects hived in her succulent skull
Make a beeline for the honey mouth

My life once breathed like a ouija board
Just ghosts of 'yes', mostly ignored
So I wished for her and like tragedy she came
Dispensing hatred

Death amongst us all
The hypnotic guest that permeates the ball
Is a creature who has leeched me, beautiful
And beguiling in enticing whispers

And lest she breaks the fall
Be prepared for shattered miracles
The moon has never shone so red and terrible
As on that night my madness rose to kiss her

Strife then seethed like a terrible sea
Buried in a life lost prematurely
Classic Poe had no horrors on me
When her claws had dug deep enough

Enough!

Once hurting, for certain
A curtain of dark ravens has risen
Asserting 'nevermore'!

Nevermore!

Burning with the lifting sickness of a tortured soul

Joying
In the turn of her infernal final screw
Laughter masked Saturnalia
As the mallet in my linen wished her grin anew

That wicked bitch
Cruella to the bone
Each vivid stich
Just tied me to her throne
In exaltation
She built on endless lies
Mircalla, Maleresian
Architect of my despise

In exaltation
My sweet revenge presides
For I have lived through Sodom and tomorrow
And the vampyre at my side

10. Onward Christian Soldiers

Aching floorboards spoke my name
In the belly of the beast to foreign shores
In tune with tides that whispered fame
And fortune for our humble Lord

Ecclesiastical banners
Unfurl in the manner
Of those who seek conquest and gain

Sail forth for Outremer
The Promised Land prised from the hands
Of blasphemers amassing there
Awakened from the desert sands capes

Onward Christian soldiers
Fated Nazareth and Bethlehem
Have fallen to an enemy bolder
It is said to widespread slaughter and rape

We are all sinners, enslaved to the cross
God wills The Great War to erase
The Judaic acres, the Mohammedans
In defence of our revenant faith

Political prowess takes to the stage
A pilgrimage led bu the sword
The sweet maiden blast of our clarion rage
Against the foul heretic hordes

The blazing invader Crusader parade
Vatican sanctioned and Mammon adored

Now, papal-led to die
The fatal battle cry
A natural army vies
For stretching Christendom

Wide, we slay the infidel
Remiss our way to Hell
Pay well the wishing well
With golden martyrdom

Scaling the towers with power ordained
Dark flowers of infamy bud

Ransacking, hacking off Saracen reign
The temple drinks claret in floods

Mercy forgotten in our ill-gotten gain
Of women and innocent blood

Death abides in this domain of ashes
The streets are stained
With the butchered foe
Now I hear the bells of triumph ringing
As they lay there rotting in their thousand shrouds
Beneath the clouds
That skitter and scatter
Dispersions on the truth of heaven

We are all sinners, enslaved to the cross
God wills The Great War to erase
The Judaic acres, the Mohammedans
In defence of our revenant faith

No crescent moon
No prophet of doom
Shall wail above Jerusalem
Vast hypocrites
All grasping for glitz
Have taken The Mount and The Tomb

Here in the kingdom of loss


11. Blooding The Hounds Of Hell


12. King Of The Woods

Solsticial
The lake is as a mirror
For the moon
That shimmers high above
The sacrificial
Lamb becoming clearer
Soon shall be
Just a shave that craved her love

Arician oaks cloak the sacred grove
Wherein her priest
Awaits to greet
His successor to this ancient throne

The King Of The Woods
Stands staunchest guard
O'er the golden bough
In the eldritch haunts of Nemi where
I rake the fecund dells to take his crown

Midsummer night grows pensive
On the murder to befall
The incumbent fright defensive
Against my intense intent to rule

Divine right by the bravest slave
To perpetuate the flame
To ascend to watch blest vestals bathe
Where their temple bares Diana's name

The King Of The Woods
Rex Nemorensis
Cleaves the gilded tree
And accepts the sentence of the God
To rest his kindred spirit free

The Queen Of The Stars
Alights to earth
And from the silvered water's edge
She means to take me in her arms
But favours fulsome forest beds instead

Communion with heaven
The Goddess of the wild countryside

An Egeria and Virbius
We pleasure endeavour
Together we ride

I show my face, the lustrous one
And by my grace, all men undone
Fall neath my spell to fell delights
This one I chose, I froze on sight

Come sow me, mould me thy seed
So I might grow to Spring's relief
Fulfill the circle's ritual needs
Untold delights, twelve months to be

Torches draw me from this reverie
Where maids debauch me reverently
And when night dissolves, I self-absolve
Mounting my days with fate's resolve

Now
Deep in the coals of my soul
A hot tongue flickers
A reign for her flame to unfold
Before the hunt quickens Death's bow


13. Misericord

Nightmares on a roll
The spirit of fear
Has alighted here
Mercy on your soul...
This fright, crepuscular
Is muscular with vitriol

Misericord
I pass by as your shadow
The ghostly burning arrow
A marksman for your swerving heart

Misericord
I support your faith
When weary, in disgrace
You fall to doubt and pull all life apart

On this mist-enshrouded pathway
And through this hateful tarantella
In this thin labyrinth of razors
I shall grin, your soul's propeller

Misericord
Respite from the grief
These spiteful nightfall teeth
Grinding minds to tiny pieces

Misericord
Clockwork works the thief
Like an ever-ticking beast
Whose biting cogs self-denial greases

Drowned in alcohol
Sirens of the deep
Are demon forces
Mercy on your soul...
A life lived more monastic
Drastic measures must extol

On this mist-enshrouded pathway
And through this hateful tarantella
In this thin labyrinth of razors
I shall win, your soul's propeller

Bound to you like bloodline
Familiar with the cracks
The foul and fetid landscape
Just off the beaten tracks
Broods treacherous with sinkholes
The moon is doused in tar
And the fiend disaster preys upon
This straight and narrow path

Like an ever-ticking beast
Whose biting cogs self-denial greases

Misericord
I free you of the bond
To pain, now flee beyond
The veil of Death
Where peace holds reign

Misericord
I'm the killing stroke
The dagger in your throat
Under the armour
Calmer with its gain

Enemies take control
The swarming hordes
Have stormed the walls
Mercy on your soul...
Tonight I close your eyes
Before the temple falls

Before the temple falls

1. Macabre, This Banquet

2. Nocturnal Supremacy

Weak midnight promises of love,
were wept upon her grave and shunned by stars above.
In mortal life lurks my dismay.
An Angel stole my heart and Death took her away.

She sleeps beyond the grace of God,
a dreaming beauty.
If wishes could only fray that bond,
the dead would sing for me.

Twelfth moon arose with ghostly voice,
a poet's serenade.
Her name a whisper upon my lips and lo,
Rorasa came!

Fear me not my grieving king,
funereal in breath.
The secrets of the dark I know,
and thus, we shall cheat Death.

My promises wrought though despondence that night,
have delivered me gifts from the grave.
Rorasa enshadowed and eternal life,
never a Devil so vain.

The Angel is fallen, for I thought her lost,
and no heaven would silence the pain.
Teach me these secrets, the sensual frost,
desire for warm blood again.

Dark nature clasp my soul,
around her throat mine arms enfold.
To sleep, perchance to dream,
and then to dusk and flesh ascend.

The sun descends, magenta spirits fill the skies,
and wreak erotic maladies where sex and Death abide.
From writhing tides where gothick siren weave their song to shore.
Through the ashes of the battlefields where ravens and angels war.

As phantoms we have fled the basilisk of day,
to rise as phoenix taloned, nightly taking prey.

We rule like the red and risen moon upon the sea.
The stars of judgement silent, for we share joyous eternity.

Damnation!
Salvation!
Stigmata plague!

The wine of Bacchus flows.
Listen to the thunder rage!

Deceivers dragged before their cross!
I am he that vanquished Death and bore the sting of loss.
What vulgar Christ will unprise my grasp?
His temple, ruined, burns and sweet Rorasa laughs.

I am enamoured and imparadised,
to catch the fires dancing profanely in her eyes.
I will crush them all if this holds thy delight.
Rather dead forever than to lose her.
Nymph-lascivious Aphrodite!


3. Heaven Torn Asunder

Rise crepuscular
Devildom voyeurs
Rise towards the light
Nascent aeons confer

The noose of revelation
Tightens 'pon misdeed
And the serpent of truth
Eats the nomad destiny

Vast shadows gather
In penumbral reign
Blind masses bring the jury of chaos
Poised to sodomize the human world back

Supernal curtains hang tattered
As others feast on the loss of command
Vengeance climbs Babel's ivory tower
Masturbated by a Cretan priestess

Victory spent
Breathe deep benighted scent

Seething fever demons gnaw in me
Like the tugging of my veins to feed
From sweet flowing waters of divinity
Millenniums turned black....

Attack!

Pour out our rages on those despised
Vulgar religion of the skies
Storm the citadels aloof upon the clouds
Erasing jealousies beneath eternal shrouds
Come lift thine eyes bedizened with delight

The fifth epoch is ours!

Artemis
Spread the lust of the dark Fantasia

Celebrate, renew the grave
The infidel soon unmasks her face

A crescent moon waxing forevermore
Sharpened to skewer dawn....

I am as a plague born unto darkness
The secret amour of an archangel's rape
A casualty when my mother, possessed
Cursed at the stake

Attack!

Pour out thy rages on those despised
Vulgar religion of the skies
Storm citadels aloof upon the clouds
We're erasing jealousies beneath eternal shrouds
Come lift thine eyes bedizened with delight

The fifth epoch is ours!

"The most asplendid sorcerers of Hades
Darkly seized for me a throne
And the upraised scythe so terribly scribed
vengeance in Jesuit blood on stone

From this ransacked celestial temple
I hold the prophet's severed head unto all nations"

Tremble before us
Lords of the star-veiled red sepulchres
Rushing deathwards, our Tartarean fires
Kindle pandemonia to furnace the earth

"Our voices are opened graves,
Through which the never-dead escape"

From deep abyssic dream
Pursuing ascendancy....

The noose of revelation
Tightens 'pon misdeed
And the serpent of truth
Eats the nomad destiny

Vast shadows gather
In penumbral reign
Blind masses bring the jury of chaos
Poised to sodomize the human world back

Supernal curtains hang tattered
As others feast on the loss of command
Vengeance climbs Babel's ivory tower
Masturbated by a Cretan priestess

The enemy has held three seasons
Imparadised, whilst we writhed
To psycho-dramas penned by aerial decree
Now freed to plunder....

Heaven torn asunder


4. Dusk... And Her Embrace

When the moonlight sleeps upon the waveless lake
And the mists steal in with ease
The children of the night may sing
But I will call to thee

"I will call to thee...."

Encroaching evening skies die with such tragedy
And the dead in their graves dwell on pleasures to be
In deepes Styria where our legend still breathes
Thou has murmured my name as the wind through the trees

And I will come, as if in dream
My languid, dark and lustrous Malaresian Queen,
Of noble love fatale
An eager guillotine
Erishkigal, raven-haired
Thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
I know thy scent by candlelight
Immortal flesh I yearn to share
Excite my greed on spattered sheets
Dyed unearthly red as sobriety weeps

Nocternity.... She shall come for me

A black velvet painting sprung to elegant life
Like a poignant Madonna perverted to night
And I have ridden from the westerning light
To expend my lust
Tear away the funereal dress
Know that I will escape from my death
Surrendered to the splendour of her sharpened caress

Lo! The pale moonlight
Weaves a poetic spell of vital death and decline
Of mist and moth and the hunger inside
Kisses took to fever and the fever, demise

"Through twilight, darkness and moonrise
My scarlet tears will run
As stolen blood and whispered love
Of fantasies undone"

Countess swathed in ebony
And snow-white balletic grace
Ruby lips procure the wish
For dusk and her embrace

Dusk and her embrace

We shall flit through the shadows,
Like a dream of (were)wolves in the snow
Consumed with ardour
A romance that ever unfolds

Beneath the stars death bedevils me
"Beneath the stars taste the death in me"
Evil is a fiery wish to sever thin mortality

The candlelight flickers
Under the deadly nightshade
Together insane
Screaming through nails of pain

Elizabeth
My heart is thine
Thy fragrant words
Warm within like wine....

"Sexual dusk allure
With asphodel eyes
Moon-glancing maleficia
Enflame the tides"

And I will come, as if in dream
My languid, dark and lustrous Malaresian Queen,
Of noble love fatale
An eager guillotine
Erishkigal, raven-haired
Thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
I know thy scent by candlelight
Immortal flesh I yearn to share
Excite my greed on spattered sheets
Dyed unearthly red as sobriety weeps

Nocternity, She shall come for me....

Unfurl thy limbs breathless succubus
The full ebmossomed fog
Imparts the night to us....


5. A Gothic Romance

Evening minuetto in a castle by the sea
A jewel more precious than the moon
lowered Her mask to me.
The sublimest creature the God of desire
Would dream about making his Queen
Drowning the air with Promethean Fire
And my heart burned with dark poetry

I fell in love with Her
Scent and feline lure,
And woodland eyes, that ushered in the impurest
Erotic, laden fantasies amid this warm Autumn night
I lulled her away from the rich masquerade
And together we kissed in the bloodletting moonlight

Oh Luna, what spell didst thou cast on me?
Her icy kiss fervoured my neck
Like whispering waves 'pon Acheron's beach.
In a whirl of dark voices and statues
That phantomed the dying trees.
This debauched seducer in black, loved me....

In a pale azured dawn like Ligeia reborn
I woke free of my sleep-sepulchre
On the sea misted lawn where stone figures, forlorn
Lamented the spectre of her
Bewildered and weak, yet with passion replete
I longed for the past overtures
The curse of unrest and her lingered caress
Seemed much more than my soul could endure....

I at once endeavoured to see her again
Lest my heart came palsied
Without even mouthing her name
On a thin precipice over carnal abyss
I danced like a blind acolyte
Drunk on red wine, her dead lips on mine
Suffused with the perfume of night

For hours I scoured the castle grounds
In vain for us to meet
When storm clouds broke, ashened, fatigued
I sought refuge in a cemetery

Sleep, usher dreams
Taint to nightmares from a sunless nether

Mistress of the dark
I now know what thou art

Screams haunt my sleep
dragged from nightmares thou hast wed together

Lamia and Lemures
Spawned thee leche
To snare my flesh

Portrait of the Dead Countess

Deep stained pain that I had dreamt
Flaunted Death's cold punishment
Leaving strength to seal this
Wretched tom

But poised nectar within my stirs
Up feverous desire and morbid purpose to search
Through cobwebbed drapery to where she swoons
Goddess of the graveyard, of the tempest and moon
In flawless fatal beauty her very visage compels
Glimpses of a heaven where ghost company fell
To mourning the loss of God in blackest velvet
Enrobed in their downfall like a swift silhouette

"Fleeting, enshadowed
Thou art privy to my sin
Secrets dead, wouldst thou inflict
The cruel daylights upon my skin?
Dost thou not want to worship me
With crimson sacrifice
So my cunt may twitch against thy kiss
And weep with new-found life?"

My realm in dusk
Torn to her embrace

Dark angels taste my tears
And whisper haunting requiems
Softly to mine ear
Need-fires have lured abominations here....

Nocturnal pulse
My veins spill forth their water
Rent by lips I cherish most

Awash on her perfidious shores
Where drowning shadows o'er the stars
Ebon's graves where lovers whore
Seraphim and Nahemah

"Nahemah"

Pluck out mine eyes, hasten, attest
Blind reason against thee, Enchantress
For I must know, art thou not death?
My heart echoes bloodless and incensed....

Doth temptation prowl the earth seducing the weak
Did not the Queen of Heaven come as Devil to me?
On that fatal Hallow's Eve when we fled company
as the music swept around us in the crisp, fallen leaves
Under horned Diana where her bloodline was sewn
In a graveyard of Angels rent in cool marbled stone
I am grieving the loss of life in sombre velvet
Enrobed in Death's shadow like a swifter silhouette....


6. The Graveyard By Moonlight

7. Funeral In Carpathia

Candelabra snuffed prey, silhouette wedded
Nightfall, take my hand
Seduce me with silky timbred limbs
Grant me thy dark command
Over the peaks framing tapestries
Of thick forest, dusk has filled
With Lucifugous kisses enwreathed in mist
Creeping surreptitiously to kill

Lucretia, I drain thy veins
Thy tears are sweeter than the mountain rain
Bewinged, infested belfries
Toll o'er the sobbing throng
A writhe of lethargic, terrored nudes
Dance to my tortuous song

I am He
The crowned and conquering darkness
Satan robed in ecumenical filth
Livid Bacchus sustained by bridal echelons of sylph

This wintry eve when the snow lies deep
And jagged ramparts wed the moonlit sky
I shrug off the shroud of preternatural sleep
Embroidered by these words Malaresia scribed....

"Beauty slept and angels wept
For her immortal soul
In this repose, these Devils chose
To claim her for their very own"

Carpathia ~ The dead shall speak of her
In graveyard tongue where pack wolves run
Blood red mist seeps across the sun

Never leave me....

This wintry night when awed stars report
Their absence from the heavenly brow
Crippled seraph shalt cower in illustrious courts
Whilst the cloaked maelstrom resounds

"How the storm it fulfills,
My heart though unhealed
Celestial knifes ebonied
And wild woods thrill
Yet far fiercer still,
Her lustre encompassing me"

Carpathia ~ Nature has long incurred
The trees to weave the cold fog like thread
Across the path the righteous tread

I rule as Master here
Where cruel winds impart my temper
Love sank wounded when I, betrayed
Saw Death etch cruelly, upon my lineage

"Arise panthered Draconis
And commit this world to thy ancient sovereignty"

Erubescent veil descend
Eclipse without an end
And legacies blessed with darkness
Forever more

Supreme vampiric evil

This wintry eve when the snow lies deep
And jagged ramparts wed the moonlit sky
I shrug off the shroud of preternatural sleep
Embroidered by these words Malaresia scribed....

"Beauty slept and angels wept
For her immortal soul
In this repose, these Devils chose
To claim her for their very own"

Carpathia ~ The dead still speak of her
In graveyard tongue where wolf packs run
Blood red mist sweeps across the sun

Candelabra snuffed prey, silhouette wedded
Nightfall, take my hand
Seduce me with silky timbred limbs
Grant me thy dark command
Over the peaks framing tapestries
Of thick forest, dusk has filled
With Lucifugous kisses enwreathed in mist
Creeping surreptitiously to kill


8. Beauty Slept In Sodom

Death, spirit me away
My anguished soul doth strain
On taut and twisted reins
Yet, insatiate I remain
A proud, unfallen star
That dares thee from afar
To calm my thund'rous heart
Yet rend it's knot apart

So I may never sing
Of red skies o'er my strings
And love, a wanton thing
Can plunge on burnt, black wings
To hang amid the thorns
Scarlet like velvet worn
About the cloud-wracked moon
Who wanes in solitude....

I am alone
Thirsting for the dark
That breathes beneath the stone
What black witchcraft
Shall cast me from thy dreams
And what perverse world-strategy
Will crawl with thee from sleep?

"Rouse my disease
And with cadent naked dance I shalt teach
Thee wisdom of darkness
From earth and red sea

Lightbearing Samael
Coalesce with me...."

Twilight
Through frosted gates
Entwining shadows of the snake
By candlelight
Thanateros rites
Death seduced and chaos wakes

Obsession grips, blindragon fever
In throes of scythed orgasm, Eros dies
And Saturn rapes faith's lovelorn Diva
Upon a cyprean altar
Stripped bare for sacrifice

Virtue births a demon
Pandora's box, unhinged, sets loose the night
Winged Lilith born for want of Eden
Fanning plumes of harlotry
Like pearls before the desert swine

In time, the oceans parts
Storm as a Kraken
Reborn Venus as thou art
Feeding at my banquet
Of Saturnalia.
I call thee having wrestled
The tides from lonely Diana

"For thee Endymion,
I forsake the cerements
Of this star-flung tomb"

Be-with-us, come
Unveil the ancient flame
Throw the cats our enemies
Desire's menstrual strain
Eastern Devil eyes
A cruel erotic plague
The Shekhina is in exile
And the Israelites.... enslaved

Midnight
Jerusalem
A tenebrous phantasy
Revelates to men
Their celestial walls crumble
When walks the Xul
Born to the scarlet whore in Babylon


9. The Haunted Shores Of Avalon

Herodias and I have led a phantom cavalcade
Through veiled romantic history where superstitions reigned
And Christendom sought to pervert, but poets of my name
Sang of penumbral victories that sorcery had claimed
The Graal and mighty Caliburn as votive offerings
To an England rearisen under vast prophetic wings

These are the shores where to my soul
Blood-drenched and unredeemed
Shalt seek solace in secrets told
And tranquil as a dream

From the woods Pendragon-born, I rose Arcturius
A proud and mighty king robed in the chivalry of lust
Death and fate undaunted me, I drew a throne divided
Glorious the battles won Black Adraste provided
Then treachery, a wingless beast, came crawling to my court
And now I lie at cursed Camlann, from wounds a traitor wrought

From wounds a traitor wrought....

I fear the Augean light is gutting Camelot
How bittersweet my triumphs seem
Now Autumnal dreams succumb to frost
Morganna art thou near me?
My strength wilts near a grave
Cast my sword to the sylphid grasp
Of the Naiad 'neath the silvered lake

When waters stirred lay silent
Mistress let the mists descend
Thy tears cannot thaw Death's cold heart
His sombre gaze defies legend
More so than thine lest thy dew-lidded eyes
Art for the Banshee's song.
Or our souls entwined like vein upon
The haunted shores of Avalon

The haunted shores of Avalon

I greet thee Dark Immortals
On this isle 'neath the moon
Why hast our kingdom fallen
To the enemy so soon
Let loose the hounds of darksome night
To pillage, plague and burn
As slumber lures me 'mongst the dead
To scheme of my return

Archaic ghostly echoes breathe like thunder of the storm
A tempest fools miscall divine as they crouch awaiting dawn
Their ignorance has forged for me over centuries a sword
Burnished to flash like lightning on the precipice of war
The wolves are dead in Albion whilst the passive flocks roam free
Thus my penetrant spearhead shalt pierce these foul trespassing breeds

These are the shores where to my soul
Blood drenched and unredeemed
Shalt seek solace in secrets told
And tranquil as a dream

"I have awoken from the past
Lenghening the shadows
Over England's bitter scars
I prize wide the wounds
Her soils whetted, drink
Remember me as king
When I cradle elder stars
Like lovers in my arms
Nestled vipers to my breast
Venomed forces work these cards
Of Devils and priestess....
Thus I shall rule anew
Through sinews of a song
Played upon a storm
By the ghosts of Avalon
And all in league will bow to me
From death they shall ascend
To whisper winds of war to stir
The dark-one-thing in men

10. Carmilla's Masque

11. A Gothic Romance

Evening minuetto in a castle by the sea
A jewel more precious than the moon
lowered Her mask to me.
The sublimest creature the God of desire
Would dream about making his Queen
Drowning the air with Promethean Fire
And my heart burned with dark poetry

I fell in love with Her
Scent and feline lure,
And woodland eyes, that ushered in the impurest
Erotic, laden fantasies amid this warm Autumn night
I lulled her away from the rich masquerade
And together we kissed in the bloodletting moonlight

Oh Luna, what spell didst thou cast on me?
Her icy kiss fervoured my neck
Like whispering waves 'pon Acheron's beach.
In a whirl of dark voices and statues
That phantomed the dying trees.
This debauched seducer in black, loved me....

In a pale azured dawn like Ligeia reborn
I woke free of my sleep-sepulchre
On the sea misted lawn where stone figures, forlorn
Lamented the spectre of her
Bewildered and weak, yet with passion replete
I longed for the past overtures
The curse of unrest and her lingered caress
Seemed much more than my soul could endure....

I at once endeavoured to see her again
Lest my heart came palsied
Without even mouthing her name
On a thin precipice over carnal abyss
I danced like a blind acolyte
Drunk on red wine, her dead lips on mine
Suffused with the perfume of night

For hours I scoured the castle grounds
In vain for us to meet
When storm clouds broke, ashened, fatigued
I sought refuge in a cemetery

Sleep, usher dreams
Taint to nightmares from a sunless nether

Mistress of the dark
I now know what thou art

Screams haunt my sleep
dragged from nightmares thou hast wed together

Lamia and Lemures
Spawned thee leche
To snare my flesh

Portrait of the Dead Countess

Deep stained pain that I had dreamt
Flaunted Death's cold punishment
Leaving strength to seal this
Wretched tom

But poised nectar within my stirs
Up feverous desire and morbid purpose to search
Through cobwebbed drapery to where she swoons
Goddess of the graveyard, of the tempest and moon
In flawless fatal beauty her very visage compels
Glimpses of a heaven where ghost company fell
To mourning the loss of God in blackest velvet
Enrobed in their downfall like a swift silhouette

"Fleeting, enshadowed
Thou art privy to my sin
Secrets dead, wouldst thou inflict
The cruel daylights upon my skin?
Dost thou not want to worship me
With crimson sacrifice
So my cunt may twitch against thy kiss
And weep with new-found life?"

My realm in dusk
Torn to her embrace

Dark angels taste my tears
And whisper haunting requiems
Softly to mine ear
Need-fires have lured abominations here....

Nocturnal pulse
My veins spill forth their water
Rent by lips I cherish most

Awash on her perfidious shores
Where drowning shadows o'er the stars
Ebon's graves where lovers whore
Seraphim and Nahemah

"Nahemah"

Pluck out mine eyes, hasten, attest
Blind reason against thee, Enchantress
For I must know, art thou not death?
My heart echoes bloodless and incensed....

Doth temptation prowl the earth seducing the weak
Did not the Queen of Heaven come as Devil to me?
On that fatal Hallow's Eve when we fled company
as the music swept around us in the crisp, fallen leaves
Under horned Diana where her bloodline was sewn
In a graveyard of Angels rent in cool marbled stone
I am grieving the loss of life in sombre velvet
Enrobed in Death's shadow like a swifter silhouette....

2. Existential Terror

Meaningless
Is this all there is
A flicker of life in a black forever?

Shine a light on the bowels of Heaven
Dark futures howl in her grip
Frightening new constellations, headlong
Press their scowls on Orion's lip
Our earth is strangled
From within and soon without

Existential terror
Four Horsemen our pall bearers
Riding nightmares of purebred belief
In the coming apocalypse

Existential terror
Furies spit on grave endeavours
The world is a slippery reef
Encircled by beasts of the sea
'Neath an eclipse

The more we know, all the more we quiver
On our knees before prophecies
Just begun or being sung for countless centuries
Psalms carved deep into our psyches
Our earth, newfangled
Abrim with sin and fully undevout

Existential terror
Four Horsemen our pall bearers
Riding nightmares of purebred belief
In the coming apocalypse

Existential terror
Bleak winds blow storm-crow scarers
The world is a slippery reef
Encircled by beasts of the wing
'Neath an eclipse

A gnawing fear of death
Of the great beyond
Of the lessening bells of midnights left
To dwell upon what the hell went wrong

A perverse, reverse Pentecost
Mass cataclysm, all is lost
Accursed music of the spheres
Ascends to score a bitter ending here

Existential terror
Pestilential errors fly
In the face of planetary strife
Existential terror
Four Horsemen our pall bearers
Riding nightmares of purebred belief
In our extermination

Decide
Eyes scour blazing skies
Time to embrace the inevitable
We are all going to fucking die

3. Necromantic Fantasies

Lovecraft the day
Bend it to Wyrd ways
Life wends, a masquerade
Where nothing is forever
Save the grave
And our desire burning

Look about us now, unbowed
The world is furled in tragedy
And outed from the madding crowd
Hurdles bless our destiny

When the moon is full
And the wolves howl in the forest
Would you take my hand
And lead us both on our dark adventure?
Would we share our dreams
Those necromantic fantasies?
So could we ever be
Apart, when our hearts align like thunder?

Do what thou wilt
Never got their guilt
Death purrs with a sombre lilt
Precious hours
As sylph and Filth
Are built on borrowed time

So let us fly
Twin spirits joined as one inside
As countless devils hone damnation
We shall revel in our own salvation
Before we die
Before high judgement comes crashing nigh
Let's seat our fates together
On the throne of paradise

My soul was caricature, rest assured
It hobbled cold and lame
Then across my defenses of frost
You came, eyes full of flame

So when the stars spill out
And the nights are filled with terror
Will you whisper truth
Right us from their human error?
Would we share our dreams
Those necromantic fantasies?
So could we ever be
Apart, when our hearts align like thunder?

Love conquers all, love conquered me
It put the Magdalen on her knees
So breathe the magic in the air
Tragic tastes sit everywhere
As heavens fix their wrathful eye
On man licking the planet dry
Of leavened tears, lets you and
I just spread our wings...

When the moon is full
And the wolves howl in the forest
Would you take my hand
And lead us both on our final voyage?
Would we share our dreams
Those necromantic fantasies?
Really, could we ever be
Apart, when our hearts lie six feet under?


4. Crawling King Chaos

Ravaged are the heavens
Seven angels are deployed
The seals delivered
To return us to the void

And waiting on the cusp of many dusks of man
He watches as the masses seek a fake salvation
As He breeds annihilation

Now death is law
Venom dripping from the mouth of madness
Incites the rites of war

Prepare the heights of Empire for the agonising fall
The beast is rising
Enwreathed in flame
The soundtrack bleeds insanity
His theme, the screaming End Of Days

Come
Crawling King Chaos, come

Sing his name in rapture, wormwood bitter, spat in tongues
Of ancient Pandemonia for the ghosts all shall become
Returning to the churning of primordial seas
The Order Of Disorder restored through tribulation
Through this bred annihilation

The whole world is his church now
A seismic paradigm shift to chaos

Apophis
Reach dark office
Apophis
Seize the Goddess

Apophis
Reach dark office
Apophis
Seize the Goddess

Apophis
Reach dark office
Apophis
Be the prophet's propaganda

The beast is rising
A cancer at the core
Of everything accelerating
To Death's apathetic maw

The beast is rising
Underlit by gore
Stone tablets crack, humanity
Is doomed to looming horror score

Scatter brittle insects, fate is heard
In the necrotic birth
Of the terminus plague
Satan has fallen
Midst dark waters of the Earth

Come
Crawling King Chaos, come

Mountains heave great murmurs
Fires raze the forests black
As billions flee the horsemen
Creation, wounded, staggers back

To expire in the mire, wiped from all of time
It will be eternally that we never existed
By this bred annihilation

Apophis
Reach dark office
Apophis
Seize the Goddess

Apophis
Reach dark office
Apophis
Seize the Goddess

Apophis
Reach dark office
Apophis
Be the prophet's propaganda

The beast has risen
Behind the sun
The least unleashed is Armageddon
For everything and everyone

The beast has risen
Tearing wide the door
For our burning footprint
On a cindered world, sinning no more

A cindered world, sinning no more


5. Here Comes A Candle... (Infernal Lullaby)

6. Black Smoke Curling From The Lips Of War

Drunk off the wine of her mass fornication
She sits astride turbulent seas
Her poisoned cunt harbor to deep fascination
Nations in thrall to the Great Harlot Babylon

She is desire
Free, swathed in dark ecstasies
She will not tire
Bathe in her fire, the Great Harlot Babylon

I have loved her stars too deliciously
To be fearful of the consequences

Judgements, hellbent
On vengeful wing
Descend to swell her cemeteries

Her orchids unfurl as bureaucracy moulders
Sweet opiates further the dream
The fate of the world on her silk-caressed shoulders
Scarlet this woman, the Great Harlot Babylon

She breeds acceptance
Of greed and hypocrisy
Decreed is the sentence
Her prophetic downfall
Unheeded by everyone

I have drunk of her fruits too viciously
To turn my face from her desecration

From foreign shores come the claws to rend her
To burn it all, this opulent splendor
And cast her down in naked surrender
Back to the spurn of the fall

The sins of the earth have spread out her vines
Eastern at birth, now she westers the vespertine
Festers and shines there

The scent of her fragrances hung like a noose
Upon Eden's forbidden tree
The Mother Of Exile, beguiling and loose
Tongued like a serpent, the Great Harlot Babylon

She is desire
Free, swathed in grave liberties
She will not tire
Bathe in her fire, the Great Harlot Babylon

Her putrescence blazes, deep mystery Babylon

And though the skies
In tumult, agonise
She still swaggers in the shadow
Of the towers aimed at God

Black smoke curling from the lips of warfare
Black smoke curling from the lips of war

See, false cathedral
She feeds this evil
Regime with the fecal
So flee from her, people

For freed, the primeval
Will bleed her steeples dry in every way
Idolatress, Ishtar, mistress
Shalt suffer a painful, shameful death
Her soul disgorged
And then be left with nothingness


7. Discourse Between A Man And His Soul

I look back on the books of my life I've written so well
Father I fell
Farther I fell
For coveted girls and the sins that follow them
I have loved and laughed enough for half a battalion of foes
But nobody knows of my inner demeanour but thee

Nightmares
Slink in their dark lairs
Thinking of plots where
Everything rings with the sting of depravity
As thou have seen I have not always danced on the edge of the world
I have oft lost my mind
In labyrinths, blind
And broken my bread with the flies

I just don't want to die
Without thee by my side
Sated and beautiful
I will struggle with keys at the gate
Never a saint, far from decency's grace
True to my heart
Bearing off-the-chart latitudes

Father I fell
Farther I fell
A reckless Rakehell with misdeeds that still honour me
I see now that beauty held me mesmerised under a spell
Father I fell
Farther I fell
Down slick mythic wells
Where emptiness swallowed me

I have lived and gasped enough
For more than ten thousand shadows
But nobody knows of my innermost demons but thee

Nightmares
Slink in their dark lairs
Eyes are aflame there
Waiting to sink their despicable teeth into me
As thou have seen I have not always danced on the edge of the world
I have succoured and fought
Like a fucker for naught
But the right to be left to my dreams

Finally soul I am free
Joyously thralled to recalled memories of yore
So before I pass I must see thee if only once more
Oh my beautiful friend
I will love thee until the end is nigh
And in time
I'll find thee in my arms on the vast other side
Father I fell
I look back on the books of my life
I've written so well
Father I fell
Farther I fell, a reckless Rakehell
With misdeeds that still honour me
I see now that beauty held me mesmerised under a spell
Father I fell
Farther I fell, down slick mythic wells
Where emptiness swallowed me


8. The Dying Of The Embers

Bloodstains, not rose petals lie on the path
To the gluttonous bed of the whore
For she, who is Satan, the waiting bloodbath
Is preparing her nation's for war
For war!

Anthropogenic
Dark angels wring
The fabric of life free of tears

Choking black fronds
From the censers they bring
Encircle as Apocalypse nears

Midnight is the phase
Seismic second waves
End of final days near

Sorrowed Holocene
Blackened back to clean
Like Man has never been here

Nothing but burnt
Skies ever learnt
The fate of that terrible game

It is not this stirred circus
Strength that deserts us
Fires that hurt us
But the dying of the embers

That murders all hope for the flame
For the ghost of humanity to rise once again
Unsympathetic judgement descends
Nine billion souls under heel
Storm-clouds ablaze, razors slice through the ends
Of the Earth, with insatiable zeal

Midnight is the phase
Seismic second waves
End of final days near

Sorrowed Holocene
Blackened back to clean
Like Man has never been here

Nothing but burnt skies ever learnt
The fate of that terrible game
It is not this stirred circus
Strength that deserts us
Fires that hurt us, that brings on the pain

Nothing but burnt
Skies ever learnt
The fate of that terrible game

It is not this stirred circus
Strength that deserts us
Fires that hurt us
But the dying of the embers
That murders all hope for the flame

Our lengthening reach went astray
Ignoring the laws of our brittle existence, the universe clawed
And tore it away

Life is a dream
In an endless charade
Armageddon deadens (Armageddon deadens)
(Armageddon deadens, Armageddon deadens)

History warned us but we chose to pray
We murdered all hope for the flame
For the ghost of humanity to rise once again

Nothing but burnt
Skies ever learnt
The fate of that terrible game

It is not this stirred circus
Strength that deserts us
Fires that hurt us, that brings on the pain

Nothing but burnt
Skies ever learnt
The fate of that terrible game

It is not this stirred circus
Strength that deserts us
Fires that hurt us
But the dying of the embers

That murders all hope for the flame


9. Ashen Mortality

10. How Many Tears To Nurture A Rose?

Our time together ends
The sadness is over
I tried my best to make amends
But my heart grew cold and black
I have knelt before your altar
Read the missives from your psalters
In many ways, I was bound to falter
You gave me nothing back

Religious fervour got us no further
The Goddess silent to the zealots that serve her
Veneration, masturbation
Icons of deceit built on fluidic foundations

I'd have offered you the world from an elven spire
These thoughts shall not prevail
For in our time, the ships had set sail

Disguise the hurt with wine and fire
How many tears to nurture a rose?
How many thorns to tear us both into pieces?

The night, the night grew chill
And in its arms, I fantasized
And fell into her darksome eyes

I woke upon the sand
The madness was over
I tried my best to understand
But my mind, bewitched, was gone
I had crawled within her garden
Seen the things that would make a soul harden
Saints and sinners all begging her pardon
I had hung upon her cross

The taste of bliss turned to venomous piss
Now the graven angels sing of loss

I'd have offered you the world from an elven spire
These thoughts shall not prevail
For in our time, the ships had set sail

Disguise the hurt with wine and fire
How many tears to nurture a rose?
How many thorns to tear us both into pieces?

Faith bled away from the shore that day
Nothing but the whispers of the vista at play
Advanced, answered my
Lonely prayers, my spent libations
Thunder coming with a pent frustration
You could have been my esteemed salvation
And we'd have had it all
If you'd only stepped from your pedestal

I'd have offered you the world from an elven spire
These thoughts shall not prevail
For in our time, the ships had set sail

Disguise the hurt with wine and fire
How many tears to nurture a rose?
How many thorns to tear us both into pieces?


11. Suffer Our Dominion

The ability to sustain life on earth is shrinking
In perfect unison with rising population
Soon, half of all species will be lost to climate change
And ecological collapse due to human activity
Thus we either reduce our race voluntarily
Or nature will do it for us
And she will be fucking brutal

A grave infection killing its beautiful host
Destroying precious habitats
Acidifying seas, raising the ghost
Exhausting resources
Retaking Eden back

Inhumankind now drives mass extinction
No escape from an enemy of billions
Pity the poor creatures that suffer our dominion

Nowhere left to live unhindered
The Angel of Death slips through the creaking eaves
Everywhere we touch polluted
Greed sits across the table, suited
Welting Mother Gaia like a rash
Bow to our domination
Last belts of nature 'neath the lash
We need to bleed
To devour all creation
Feed the masters
Vast abattoirs existing for our prey
Breeding disaster
Naive consumption
Forefront of the coming plagues

The end descends on all with no distinction
Omnicide, Theriocide the final curtain
Cataclysm close to midnight, that is certain
Inhumankind now drives mass extinction
No escape from an enemy of billions
Pity the poor creatures that suffer our dominion

Suffer our dominion

We are currently consuming natural resources
At almost twice the rate the planet can renew them
Thus to restore the balance, nature will retaliate
But it will be no subtle pruning of our luxuries
It will be a cruel and merciless catastrophe on a global scale
And without doubt
It will be the end of life as we know it

A simple fact, vast errors weigh
Thus Terra acts to curb our play
A coffin for the world handmade to measure
From forests' twisted treasures
Now lost to frost forever
The end has come

Jungles culled, sold on or cindered
The Angel of Death slips through the burning leaves
Everywhere we touch polluted
Trees of wisdom long since rooted

Inhumankind now drives mass extinction
No escape from an enemy of billions
Pity the poor creatures that suffer our dominion

No escape from an enemy of billions
Pity the poor fuckers that suffer our dominion
No escape, no escape, no escape, no escape, no escape, no escape
(So pity the poor creatures that suffer our dominion)


12. Us, Dark, Invincible

Us, dark, invincible
Us, dark, invincible

Seize the night
Before the fevers take flight
Cicadas drown out delight
In this horny cornucopia
The stars are alight
We have desires in sight
Dark immortals, bedight
In the throes of lycanthropia

Drink deep when dusk descends
The moon-kissed air
That succours...

Us, dark, invincible
Us, dark, invincible
We know our sins appall
Us, dark, invincible
Us, dark, invincible
We know our sins appall

We, the children of The Fall
Dripping with gall
The gothic-scarred principle
Our balustrades standing tall
Us, dark, invincible

Freeze the day
Let our nocturnal foray
Keep Aurora at bay
From this candlelit utopia
As orchestras play
Nightmares speak of the way
We're painting over the grey
In a dripping red sinopia
Bursting with flame
Seasoned teeth, never tame
We're first in whispered disdain
Icons for their nyctophobia
We suitor ill winds
Incalculable sins
The face of vanity grins
At our human race ectopia

Drink deep when dusk descends
The moon-kissed air
That succours...

Us, dark, invincible
Us, dark, invincible
We know our sins appall
Us, dark, invincible
Us, dark, invincible
We know our sins appall

We, the children of the fall
Dripping with gall
The gothic-scarred principle
Our balustrades standing tall
Us, dark, invincible
Us, dark, invincible

What fires die
In the hearts of those awry?
And what mad embers arise
In the veins of the insatiable?
What dreams might fly
Through the mist and midnight skies
When our cold souls fantasise
On the warmth of walls now scaleable?

Never
Never will we break the vows
We took when we swore to the dark
Never will the shadows bow
On the house of our ancient caste
Never
Never will their rule renew
For when the Day Of Reckoning is over
I'll bring their severed heads to you


13. Sisters Of The Mist

Witching hourglasses
Bleed the hissing sands of time
As this story, gory, a catharsis
Leads toward the quite sublime
We have such sights to show you

Enslaved from the start
She captured my heart
I recall our lips trembled a whisper apart
And when she died
I cried to darkened orders
Fell fiends of the abyss
(Beware their kiss)
Sisters of the mist

Through split lips of torture
I scream out her name
Clarissa, I miss her
Death's fissure remains
She hangs in the courtyard
Neath a cold, callous moon
Her bruised naked carcass
Displayed for the boon
Of those who desired her
Fiery womb
If tomorrow we burn
Tonight we will seal their doom

Enslaved from the start
She captured my heart
I recall our lips trembled a whisper apart
So when she died
I cried in darkened corners
Fell fiends of the abyss
(Beware their kiss)
Sisters of the mist

As guards drunkenly slept, fog crept from dank woods
Slithering, slathering, beasts understood
That starved, vengeful spirits of similar fates
Had answered the prayers I left at their cemetery gates

From the scarred side of midnight
Monstrosities came
Clarissa, I wished
For hellfire to rain
These vehement women
Lithe Stygian shades
Tore through the murk
Like a forest of razorblades
Fating, castrating
Each soul to be taken
And freed from my cell
On reaching the gallows
Enshadowed, I fell

Witching hourglasses
Bleed the hissing sands within
As the net of retribution passes
Leaving nothing breathing in its skin
A waste of good suffering

The coven dispel with the first rites of dawn
Sated they fade, now benign
I cut down my bride and cry out, forlorn
Cradling her spent body to mine
Then for one rent moment
A miracle spurred from the pain
Death lends her back to my fervent embrace
Three final words as she slips to oblivion

Enslaved from the start
She captured my heart
I recall our lips trembled a whisper apart
And when she died
I cried on darkened shores
Despisal, reprisal for holy fists
(Beware their Mephistory)
Sisters of the mist
Sisters of the mist

Now the sun rises on streets steeped in blood
I stagger her corpse to the lake
The feared Water Wyrds creature up from the mud
To take us to depths far away from the stake

As the cold waves enclose, I shall falter no more
Nothing is ghosting me back to the shore
And though I have knelt at this altar before
Death will unite us, our nights will be glorious
Together, victorious
And legendary, even in hell

14. Unleash The Hellion

I have basked like a phantom in shadow
Haunting gauntest opera eaves
As the cast was aware of nothing more in the air
Than the whisper of snow on the Autumnal breeze

As the ignorant waltzed
The ballad changed it's melody
Shunning the sun for infernal gloom
I felt joy in deep misery
But fate's found me out by the plight of the moon
Blazing a path that laughed at my own ill-ease

Drown despair with molten deeds
Fell the beast before it feeds
Master the sacred
Blast the horns that razed cities
Tell the grating world upon its knees
That I am free

This tethered Hellcat is unleashed
Unwinding, sore
Grinding to the core
This fucking Hellion is unleashed

The feeling is back like a Pharaonic curse
The scent of fresh blood to a ravenous thirst
Lazarus risen, brought back from the dead
Realisation, this seasoning dread
Adrift in the cosmos, naked and rife
We breed without meaning
Gifted with fleeting life

Drown despair with molten deeds
Fell the beast before it feeds
Master the sacred
Blast the horns that razed cities
Tell the grating world upon its knees
That I am free

The gates of the mind splinter open wide
On rusted hinges, must infringes
Senses thrust to override
Explode upon reality, I thought long-lost, I failed to see
The forest for the trees
My fire had fled and died
I now behold a dawn adorned with majesty
To never dare embrace it would be a travesty
A seething Chaotopia, a bedlam time story
For, if this is the end
I want my wretched scars to breathe

Now sinkholes spit me back
The shades retreat like scattered dogs
As the earth is ablaze with the end of days
I watch the palaces burn along with gods

Portals of thought have delivered me
From the brink of a stinking abyss
Wherein the view was of pain and askew
With an apathy born of crisis
Existential, for our place in the spheres
Gleamed meaningless, I must confide
I suffered, a fool at the mercy of fear
For what good was living when dying inside?

Drown despair with molten deeds
Fell the beast before it feeds
Master the sacred
Blast the horns that razed cities
Tell the grating world upon its knees
That I am free

This tethered Hellcat is unleashed
Unwinding, sore
Grinding to the core
This fucking Hellion is upon them

1. The Vampire From Nazareth

Ride to the land of secrets.
Find all the traces left behind...
With sword in hand the Covenant
A cross baptised in blood... the nectar of the Gods.
Might!
Making wrong to seem right.
Destroy all the traces left behind.
With sword in hand the Covenant
A cross baptised in blood.

The Vampire from Nazareth.

"For blood, is Life"

The Vampire from Nazareth.

The Templars march.
Waves of arms.
"We offer the Sun!"
The wolf is wearing the pelt of the lamb.

"We offer the Sun,
with thorns his crown.
We offer a son"

Ravens on the top... as angels fly.

"We offer the Sun,
with thorns his crown.
We offer a son

"We offer the Sun"


2. A Great Mass Of Death

Creators...
Evoke your tragedy.
Betrayers!
You can't deny your lust for destruction.
Predators...
Dance once more waltz with the flesh of your prey.
Your sharpened teeth will sink in a passionate kiss...
There's no hope for redemption.
In every funeral, I have been
Your cemeteries so secrene, with gothic dark cathedrals.

I am the Destroyer of Life, I hear you chanting for me.

A Great Mass... of Death
A Great Mass of Death
A Great Mass of Silence
It's the quiet of absence.

A Great Mass of Death
A Great Mass of Silence
A concerto of sadness.

A Great Mass of Death
A Great Mass...

Run!

A Great Mass of Death
A Great Mass of Silence

I am the Destroyer of Life,
I hear you chanting for me...

3. Pyramid God

(Again... Again you try to find me.
You seek the one not willing to be found.)
(Unlike the places you have been,
I am not confined by lines.)
(I am the dreamer of this realm
But not the dream inside)
(I am the head outside the dream
I am the headless mind!)
(Are you... Are you a breath of mine?
You cross my gates, the gates of Space and Time.)
"Pyramid God, am I the user of the gates?
I live a triangle life"
(I am the dreamer of this realm
But not the dream inside.)

(I am the head outside the dream
I am the headless mind!)

(Built me a monument, Nem Age conspirators.
Expand my theories to a world without end.)
The Pyramid God is watching...
(Built me a monument, Nem Age conspirators.
Expand my theories to a world without end.)


4. Five-Pointed Star

Your Pythagorian sign, five angles put in line
Symmetry, a door through chaos.
You try to use The Laws, emotions stir your words.
Your thoughts are reaching me.

You call me by my name, a non-forgotten name...
Earth, Fire, Air, Water, exalted Idea.
Divine the star of the elements
Pentagrammon

In memory of angels fallen.
Five-Pointed... Five-Pointed...

The path to all directions, the star of elements.
A map you seek to unfold.
Five angles are your senses.
A solid universe, I am eager to explore.

In memory of angels fallen.
Five-Pointed... Five-Pointed...

Your star ideogram, so ancient as Our kind,
Those that the heavens roam.
In distant times a calling.
In island Earth a falling, from heaven to your world.

The star ideogram, so ancient as Our kind
Earth, Fire, Air, Water, exalted Idea.
Divine the star of the elements
Pentagrammon

In memory of angels fallen
Five-Pointed... Five-Pointed...
Five-Pointed Star


5. Oceans Of Grey

Dogs on the run,
foam on their mouths
The scavengers approaching as they run from the netherworld
Savages, erosive, massive are the jaws of oblivion

In your dreams you hear a name
Was it yours? Is it reclaimed?

Autumn comes to claim the old
You forget the past painted by you

And you sink,
You can’t breathe
I an ocean of grey
memories fade

And you lose
All you’ve gained
All your triumphs in vain
black thoughts remain

Bury your name,
Forget your face.
Time, out of place.
Oceans of grey

All of your joy,
All of your pain
Emotions drained.
Oceans of Grey.

Dogs on the run,
foam on their mouths
The scavengers approaching as they run from the netherworld
Savages, erosive, massive are the jaws of oblivion

Solid earth is now dissolved.
Water fills your empty world.

And you sink,
You can’t breathe
I an ocean of grey
memories fade

And you lose
All you’ve gained
All your triumphs in vain
black thoughts remain

Bury your name,
Forget your face.
Oceans of grey


6. The Undead Keep Dreaming

Dreaming...

In 1981 when I was but a child,
I had the strangest dream...
Something that still is haunting me.
Dreaming...
A ray escaped my window blinds, a carrier of the morning light.
I opened my eyes.
My clock was keeping time.
It was another normal day
I thought I was awake.
Dreaming...

The Undead Keep Dreaming

My face! When I looked at the mirror,
I felt something was wrong.
A strange thought in my head "Am I really awake?"

The Undead Keep Dreaming

I found myself again in bed confused by what occurred
And everything as usual just seemed to be in place.
But when I questioned what I felt, in front the mirror black,
The comfort of the morning light was stolen from my heart.

In agony I tried to leave this dream and just awake,
But on and on I found myself returning in my bed.
I lost the count of times I tried and failed to reach the day
And even now I am not sure if I am here awake.

The Undead Keep Dreaming...


7. Rising

Long ago I swore an oath to levitate my soul
Above the things that seal me,
Those trying to deceive me.
I AM RISING!
I fought on psychic wars, the raids of mind control.
I closed my ears to sirens,
Their song I killed with silence.
I AM RISING!

On fields of mist, with thoughts from gold
I am rising as a Sun.

I AM RISING!

Destiny, Victory., are giving me their wings.
Not gone... I am still alive,
Through Will and strong desire. I am rising!

I fought on many wars and bled and cried and lost.
But I kept fighting on, until I reached my goal.

I AM RISING!

Destiny, Victory, have healed my broken wings.
Not gone... I am still alive,
Through Will and strong desire.

I AM RISING!


8. Apocalypse

A GOD THAT WANTS TO DIE

"Why is obtaining knowledge a reason for punishment?
Stupidity is definitely not an option for the truly powerful leader.
Who is leading who and to what end?
Why has revelation of truth (apocalypse) been connected
with the sense of great awe and great disaster?
Mankind desperately needs someone else to clean up
its mess and a scapegoat to blame for its own faults.
Is human a parasitic organism on the body of earth?
Is this the horrid truth that will be realised at the point of no return?
When a parasite sucks the lige of its host completely, it also dies.
Is man a suicidal god?
Will the paradise of Earth burn in flames?"

Bring us the end. + Harvest the crops of Men. + Horrid winds are blowing today. Hear them! + Its is the wrath of Cain. + Bringer of plagues and disease + Doom leads your hand + Writing the Apocalypse

A Gods that wants to die
A tragic kind of killer
Lunatic, fanatic
your self's greatest deceiver.

Sulphur rain. + You'll know the secrets of Hell. + Your leaders... revealed. + Shadows cover the naked kings. + Bringer of plagues and disease. + Doom leads your hand + Writing the Apocalypse

A Gods that wants to die
A tragic kind of killer
Lunatic, fanatic
your self's greatest deceiver.

GOD WANTS TO DIE!

You can turn Paradise into a wasteland. + It is your greatest design.
As tyrant, you demand nature's powers to obey.
From suicidal wrath no one will escape...


9. Mad Architect

"Where am I? How I got in here?
I feel so tired, as if I walk for many miles."
"What I see is a door leading out of this room.
I am prepared to confront whatever waits behind..."

MAD ARCHITECT

"I left the room. I am walking through a corridor.
It is so long that I cannot see its end."
Opening doors, moving in circle
Finding doors, moving in circle

A MADMAN (THE ARCHITECT) THIS LABYRINTH HAS BUILT.

Opening doors, moving in circle
Finding doors...
"All the choices I once made, the paths that I designed,
Have formed this endless labyrinth, a product of my mind."

A MADMAN (THE ARCHITECT), THIS LABYRINTH HAS BUILT.
A MADMAN... THE ARCHITECT
He is trapped inside the maze.

Opening doors, moving in circle
Finding doors, moving in circle
A madman... the Architect


10. Therianthropy

"IF I CAN SMELL YOUR SCENT, IF I CAN HEAR YOU BREATHE,
IF I CAN USE YOUR SKIN, YOU ARE THERE FOR ME.
IF YOU CAN THINK OF ME, IF YOU CAN DREAM OF ME, IF YOU CAN SENSE ME, I AM STILL THERE... IN YOU!"

Mirror world. Mystery. Beyond the wall of skin.
Ecstasy, bond of souls, so clear as time withdraws.
Astral life runs through me... our sacred unity.
Alien thoughts, web of souls, the eldest tree, immortal.
A chord that binds the whole, darkness surrounds us all.
Your shadow follows me, your thoughts reflecting in me.
From dusk until the dawn a shape of things to come.
A lunar fantasy? A different kind of me?

DUALITY!
Mirror world. Mystery. Beyond the wall of skin.
Ecstasy, bond of souls, so clear as time withdraws.
"If I can use your skin, you are there for me" - Therianthropy
"If I can smell your scent..." - Therianthropy
A chord that binds the whole, darkness surrounds us all.
Wolf's shadow follows me, strange thoughts reflecting in me.
From dusk until the dawn I shape of things to come.
Is it my fantasy? A therion in me?
"If I can use your skin, you are there for me.
If you can think of me, if you can dream of me,
If I can smell your scent..."

THERIANTHROPY
"If you can think of me, if you can dream of me,
If you can sense me I am still there... in you!"
"Can you feel me? Can you hear me?"
Duality!
"Can you feel me? Don't you fear me?
If you can think of me, If you can dream of me...
Can you feel me? Can you hear me?"
Therianthropy
"Can you feel me? Don't you fear me?
If you can think of me, If you can dream of me..."

1. War In Heaven

In the arms of night
Laid corpses with forces drained
They strived to live
Celestial bodies scattered
A final breath of sulfur

Planets that rule the abyss
The architects behind this carnage
They are black holes in the sky
Predators lurking as spiders

Whirlpools that cannot be seen
Are sucking the dark oceans dry
Victors in these killing fields
Crushing the essence of others

Predators lurking as spiders

Whirlpools that cannot be seen
Are sucking the dark oceans dry
Victors in these killing fields
Crushing the essence of others

Fighters
Battalions turned to ashes
Dark Suns
Event horizon masters
Fighters
They clash with ruthless violence
Dark Suns
The mighty atom smashers


2. Burn

From the silence of a headless horror, learn!

When an answer comes in mind, more questions follow,
Knowledge burns like an everlasting flame.
The Promethean regime,
My authority supreme

From the silence of a deadly horror...
Burn...
My disciples wear a burning halo
Burn...

An epiphany experienced in ultra violet
As the seeker finds the truth he wants to find
Purifier of thoughts, in the clarity of forms

Learn

From the silence of a headless horror, learn
Burn
Feel the hunger of the dark explorer
Burn

From the silence of a deadly horror...
Burn...
My disciples wear a burning halo
Burn...

From the silence of a headless horror, learn!


3. Order Of Dracul

In times of endless wars
The blood awakes the beast
The Voivode of Walachia
Will feast in Tirgoviste

The dragon had a son
A mad impaling prince
Known by the name of Vlad
Ruler with an iron fist

Defender or Tyrant?
Where chaos rules supreme.
Head of the order of Dracul

Defender or Tyrant?
Where chaos rules supreme.

The forest of the impaled
Lined enemies as trees
Their corpses in decay
They dared to disobey

4. Prototype

Working, breeding
A hidden code inside
Tireless, effective
Integral part of the hive

We must control the masses
We have to rule their fears
We are the Will Divine
The Will Divine

Brainwaves, feelings
On programs we design
Clockwork empire
You are the prototype
Lunatic demigod
A faulty code inside
Lunatic demigod
The Prototype

From an artificial cell...
From an artificial human cell

Once you were sentient beings
Once you dared to live with laughs and tears
Now you are only human machines
Our humanoid toys that mimic living

5. Dogma

We embrace pain
The value of suffering
The hooks sting, removing skin

The punishment of self
A task we learn to do so well
Pleasure leads to hell!

We are the Flagellants
Your faithful servants
Persecutors and martyrs
Victims of faith

"Salve Kyrie"
Your faithful servants are insane
"Salve Kyrie"
Sinners or Saints?
It's Dogma...

6. Prometheus

Stand against our enemy
Fire
The blessing touch of your despair
Despair and loneliness
You'll rise up, before you fall again
Atrocious
The bird of prey is haunting us

"Deus"
Conquer your fears
"Deus ex machina"
"Deus"
Surpass your weaknesses
"Deus ex machina"
"Deus"
Withstand the fall and stand up again
"Deus ex machina"
Provoking, disturbing, resisting
Surviving the ordeal
As a father-head of all of us
Your flame will forge our hearts, even in oblivion!
"Deus"
"Deus ex machina"
Resurrection brings our hopes to life
And the lies and fears dissolve
We are strong

Guide us / "Deus"
Your fire in our hearts / "Deus ex machina"
Guide us / "Deus"
You are bringing fear to gods / "Deus ex machina"
Guide us / "Deus"
Your fire in our hearts / "Deus ex machina"
Guide us / "Deus"
The children of Prometheus / "Deus ex machina"

In a shadow close the blackness
Prometheus
As your breed, we are bound to fall
But our light will scare the darkness


7. Titan

Titan...

Misty moon of Saturn
A veil conceals your face
Methane rain keeps falling, clouds roaring

Your vivid landscapes
With deltas, lakes and seas
Massive mountain stones, glassy frozen thrones

Titan...

"Rex est mortuus, vivat rex!"
Your name strikes fear
"Hic domus dei est"
A giant sphere!

With terraforming
Your soil will have our seed
Massive mountain stones
Stolen icy thrones

Titan...

Titan / Human

Titan...

Humans will raise
The Titan race
"Rex est mortuus, vivat rex!"
"Hic domus dei est"


8. Confessions Of A Serial Killer

Voiceless up to this day
The shock was really strong
No words my mouth could say
Restraint, but protected behind the asylum's gates
From the screams and the tears of the dead

Erased mistakes
Like victims disposed
No names
No traces
Cases closed

The shock was really strong
No words my mouth could say
Disturbing thoughts
Confessions that make me shiver

But I cannot stop the voices in my head
Anger still lurks within

Confessions of a serial killer
The flashbacks make me shiver
Confessions of a serial killer
Make the voices stop

Confessions of a serial killer
The flashbacks make me shiver
Confessions of a serial killer
Make the voices stop
Make the voices stop


9. Ground Zero

Cold, pale, grey...

Standing still against the change of seasons
Without a coffin, the corpse of yesterday
Ground Zero...

Catacomb of perished memories
Empty slot in this necropolis
Ground Zero...

Not a soul, not even troglodytes
There's not a soul...

Washed away with the rain
All the stains that were made from blood
And the canvas is white...

No traces of blood

Washed away with the rain
All the stains that were made from blood
And the canvas is white
From an artist lobotomized

Cold, as a winter's day
Pale, as a ghost in chains
Grey, as the ashes that drift with a nuclear wind

Cold, Pale, Grey

Cold, as a winter's day
Pale, as a ghost in chains
Grey, as the ashes that drift with a nuclear wind


10. The First Immortal

Blood is pumping, heart is beating again
No frame of reference for this altered state
Time kept running in my temporary absence

Blindly watching in the gardens of the awakened
Perseverance of a soul misplaced
Sole survivor on a desolate place

No welcoming faces
I am the first
No others to greet me
I am the first

Endless paths to take, leading far away

I am the first...

Endless paths to take, leading far away

I am the first Immortal
I am the first
I am the first Immortal

Part man, part machine
Wearing my synthetic skin

I am the first
I am the last!

1. Erebus

Waiting the drawing of the underworld
None to share your fears
The shadow of Charon falls
Upon the stone of hopes
The body is paralysing
The air is too thick to enter
A cataclysm is spawned into the regions of the soul
The cry of the first time
When you were free from the womb,
Is the same but now you are entering the night

Most try to understand why they are born if they must die.
Life seems pointless with an end
They wonder if existence remains after death
Or Erebus is the final state

"You knew from the beginning
That the end will come in time.
Yet, so many things you left undone
So many more unknown
In a life that is but a dream
Into a gods dream."

Most try to understand why they are born if they must die
Life seems pointless with an end

"Existence is a choice that remains after death.
Erebus is my mental state."


2. Another Reality

In a dream I saw a man
A face not strange to me
He stared at me while I was asleep and whispered in my ear
He led me through the corridors of my ancestral home
He stopped one step before one wall, and then I fainted

In the eldest wall of my home I found the entrance of a CRYPT
The view I saw was so obscure,
alien remnants, pentagrams and candles of the floor

The crypt was made as a passage to the gates of reality
And just when I realised the truth I was in a different shape

I hear thousands of sounds
like bestial laughs, deafening flutes and daemonic choirs
Possibilities fall under control, unfolding new dimensions


3. Temple Of The Lost Race

Preserved from the ancient years
When Earth was just a newborn star
The proof of a distant truth
Arrogantly stands mocking the wind
Guarding mysteries that man has not unchained

An emblem of power has remained, a fallen temple....

Faded pictures all over the walls
Projecting a horrid state of sanity
Figures that don't belong to a human race
Symbols and maps
Architectural miracles carrying the history of a race
That now seems lost

Fears born from the past
Temple of the lost race
Deep inside the heart of the pole
An old ruler of the stars

Buried in a chest from glass,
The answers about our path
Eternal life can't rest asleep
It lurks beneath as force of will
Ancient are the rules set on this world

An emblem of power will remain, a fallen temple....

Fears born from the past
Temple of the lost race
Deep inside the heart of the pole
An old ruler of the stars


4. Setting Of The Two Suns

In a world of endless light, into the boundless space
Two suns the only gods, two burning holes in the sky

Without a warning the two suns slowly faded
Abandoning their only children unprotected from the cold

Down on their knees. They have total conscience
As night drains their spirit, the inner light of logic
Leaving the bodies to walk this blind planet
Stumbling to others that now are animals, crying light

Setting of the two suns

Then a light came from the horizon
Devouring the land
It wasn't sun!

It took a minute for a flame to become a fire
The great cities will all become ashes
Drifting with the wind

1. Mystic Places Of Dawn

They lasted as long as a spark shines
but their shining was so bright
that it was caught forever
in the spectre of time.
What was a fact became a legend
what was reality became a faded canvas
in the mausoleum of civilizations.

Landscapes of untold antiquity
unchanged are calling
to an orgy of colours and shapes
in a drunkenness with pure fantasy

Their names cause awe and awake
forgotten senses

The eerie valley of PNATH
The majestic LEMURIA
SARNATH the doomed...
and names that echo
in the labyrinths and the cavernous
dephts of chaos
Mystic Places of Dawn

Maybe we, ourselves want to forget
helping the truth to grow old
and be deformed from the wrinkles
of uncertainty
Afraid where the path backwards will
lead us
we prefer to be protected
under the shelter of ignorance

He who stares back
through the glass of centuries
will also see his reflection.

The eerie valley of PNATH
The majestic LEMURIA
SARNATH the doomed...
And names that echo
In the labyrinths and the cavernous
dephts of chaos
Mystic Places of Dawn


2. Pale Beauty Of The Past

The mist unfolds its veil
as the night falls in the forest
The moisty wind forces the trees
to sing their sorrow.
For centuries they are standing still
like a petrified dream.
Traped bodies in a wooden web,
tall towers of another epoch.

This sweet melancholy
that is brought by the precious memory
The Pale Beauty of the Past
is kept in the whisper of the wind.

Only the fragile heart
can understand the charm of the old.
The best things in life are those we can't
have yet, still we hope.
Blessed will be the day
when the circle will be complete.
Then the song of the muse will be heard
again the mourning of the trees will stop.
This sweet melancholy
that is brought by the precious memory
The Pale Beauty of the Past
lost in the vortex of time.


3. Return To Carthage

When the fields are red
like a crimson robe
and the name of the "King" who wears
this robe is MAN
the waves of wrath have been released
to drown the "sinister" and different.

Noble causes sink in oceans of bodies
where flesh and steel is one.
Memories of Ancient Wars
remove the frozen bonds of time.

Return to Carthage
Ages have passed
and "savage" hordes have bowed
to the "true" Gods.

Glory is a whore that seduces even a
priest but few are those who taste her
kiss upon the piles of those that she
betrayed.

Return to Carthage
in bitter irony
the proud city lies raped.

Gods of order, Gods of chaos:
"Till the next time,
when our pawns will move again

in the fields of our endless battle"...

4. Crescent Moon

The sand beneath your feet
a yellow carpetin
the palace of wilderness
Only king and servant is you
searching for the pyramid
that guards the emerald board

It was a crescent moon
when you have been initiated
in the science of the black earth,
And the optimism of youth
pushed you in quests
into the paper worlds
of the libraries of Cairo
Crescent Moon
Two sides of the same coin
The poor in mind are satisfied
with what they see.
Crescent Moon
And they bear the sign of imperfection
because they miss the other side
the invisible.
Crescent Moon
Few words carved with diamond
could draw the curtains
that cover the glassy cage of senses
The warm touch of the starlight
(magnes) will be the proof
and the philosopher's stone your trophy

Grab the golden rope and climb
the imaginary walls of your thoughts
you may fall but at least you'll have tried

5. Chasing The Chimera

My mood is like the weather
it changes with unexpected ways
creating a mosaic
based on the antithesis
of cold and warm colours

If you could read in my eyes
you would discover a shade of grey
when I smile
because even when (I am) collecting
moments of happiness
my mind descends in my shrine
to pray in front of the candle of life.

And its flesh parts are slowly melting
slipping down like white worms.

(The) walls around are decorated
with nailed butterflies.
Each one a happy thought,
pretty but old and lifeless.

The thirst for joy is never gratified
only grows as pain is interrupting
our wishes
and "help" us learn through analphabet
of scars.

6. The Underwater Garden

Melancholy ascended in the surface
knowing that she'll have forever a lair
in the underwater garden.
Serene the azure body that filled
the landscape crowled as ever.

The sound here is a word without a
meaning nothing can agitate the
monotony.
The new and the old event roll indolent
embraced in a circle.

The one takes the place of the other
returning continuously in the beginning.

What didn't belonged in the fluid kingdom
has now become its integral part.
The plunder that was stolen
from the marvelous world of the unknown
is hidden deep.
Imprisoned from the seeweeds
ornamented with the flowers of the sea.

Every piece has its own story
Every creation is also a piece
of its creator.
Behind the coral gate of the garden
are sealed emotions

7. Behind The Iron Mask

In an empty room eyes without a face.
They are stirring other images,
glimpses of a distant life,
of a gone life.

The hands cannot identify the face
Behind the Iron Mask

Dim is within on the plane of the mind
a kneeled spirit under the boot of fear
cleansed with torture
traped in purity by the whip.

Daggers from sound penetrate
resistance behind each one,
a Holy inquisitor.
Mouths reveal the presence of
haunted beings unworthy to be said alive.

Open the window
Release the spirit from this empty body
Behind the Iron Mask

Draining pleasures from mental wounds
a need opposed to false excuses
unveils the greatest beast.


8. The Dreamlord

I was sailing in the sea of lethargy
Upon an empty dream
When land appeared
And filled the endless horizon.
White pillars from marble
Deep into a garden
Were shining like guiding stars.

The dreamlord.

A frozen voice from inside
Poured out in my dreamworld.

"Taste the fruit of knowledge, drink the juice of wisdom, and you'll see what eyes can't see."

The dreamlord.

"You have reached Utopia."

In the garden of illusions
Encircled from the pillars
I found my idol,
But clouds filled the purple sky
And shed their crystal tears,
And the idol became muddy.

The dreamlord.

"The right explanation of symbols depends on you.
The sun will send me away."

In the place where the idol was, appeared a white flower.

9. Mythos

1. Breaking The Inner Seal

2. Esoptron

Reversing the view towards the soul
Absorbed from the swirl of the chaotic ego
Naked from the warm familiar
company of matter

Here desires and fears are shaped,
uncontrolled multiplied in
the rhythm of ecstasy
gathered under the threat of
upcoming afflictions

Parallel futures that may
never happen are blocking
the entrance of the inner most sanctum
They are the guardians
Who is the master of this cosmos ?
Who posted them here ?
Illumination comes from within
and levitates the Eidolon

Effigies and marble busts lined in
external chains silent,
laden with creases deep like self deceit
They seem lost in their contemplation
their laurel wreath is withered

Now I know how felt the first amphibian
when allowing the air to inhabit in its lungs

The sceptre was always in my hand

ESOPTRON

3. Burning Phoenix

If you ever hear the song of a dying phoenix
don't let sadness close your ears
you may offend the secret face of nature
It is not a mourning but a hymn.

If you ever see the bright pyre strip
the nightly creature from the chains
you'll witness what the most
can only envy
the glorious coupling of the light
with the dark
Burning Phoenix rise
Ash is what you leave to go up high

The flaming bird knows the time
when the astral gates are open time
to fulfil its noble destiny
it was born to fly
Forever, with the burning legions
of its kind.

On wings of smoke they are singing
Their calling is the calling of the free
"Fly with us"


4. Astral Sea

5. Rain

Fossilized flower I can smell your perfume
covering the distance that
was called into being between us,
from the unexploited accumulation
of different moments
This gift is my inheritance and I honour it
by continuing my journey, in the curve
of the infinite alternating universes.

With anchor the three stable points
that compose your dimensional trap
I can pause and dive in your mortality.

Reality is a rain
drops are falling, are they the same ?

Some will penetrate the earthen surface
and will transform the hidden seed.
Just like fantasy can turn
an empty scenery into a heaven.

Its balance with reason is the scheme
of creation and destruction

Every dream needs a dreamer
to blossom somebody
to sense its perfume even
when he is blinded
from the light of day
Can you smell it too ?
The perfume of life

6. Ice Castle

In the land that was born from
the sperm of winter is
the incarnation of all enchanted fairy tales
An imposing figure
Isolated from an ocean of frozen waves
Trying to unite the sterile earth
with the celestial dome

Like a crystalline bridge of ice
In the claws of four ancient mountains
Ice Castle
Transparent halls filled with
wonder worthless
for those who are sweeping along with
the purposeless flood of wasted feelings.

Priceless treasure
For the children of the serpent dream

In the claws of four ancient mountains
Ice Castle

There they claim life
in a feast with your nightmares


7. Celebration

8. Succubus Priestess

She dances with the moonlight
In a ring with the silent forest
and the stars' jewels
embroidered in her ethereal garment

From silver lips chameleon thoughts
transmitted to the deepest cave
the sanctuary of the sleeping dragon
Slowly recovering its wounded mind
from the false reflections
of a broken mirror

I will cross the moat
that keeps our worlds apart
May your nebulus hands be my shroud
Succubus Priestess
In me you taste your past
In you I experience my future

Her touch is the cold breeze
that numbs my carnal disguise
and makes the glow inside
to blaze up and spread

Torches blend with misty blue
to celebrate the birth
our bond is sealed in red
our kiss is the everlasting moments


9. So Clean, So Empty

You come to me as the flies to the spider
blinded from my intellectual darkening
Try to move in the
holographic image of choice
and I'll project you one of my corridors

The cobweb is so carefully woven
That even the veil dressed fates
bow with admiration.
It has so many ways,
countless like my names

How I adore to mask the truth
so that only the worthy of my
generosity could find it.

I can wait enthrowned in the center
of this necropolis, with patience
built upon the solid stones
of millenniums

Keep feeding on the notorious lotus
swallowing my sweet promises
to sustain your lie made world

Every bite erases the instinct
so you'll become so clean, so empty
keep on feeding me


10. The Eyes Of Set

The seer of Set can recognize
the negative evolution of consciousness
Empires forged, prospered and scattered
like the sand-hills, they seemingly
disappear but are never lost
The Eyes of Set
rivers of life made of sweat and blood
score the slave's skin
as Nile scores the parched plain

The giant rocks he hauls
are never endingly creating
monuments to snakes
that change their skin
Miserable descendants of Sisyphus
just play their role
as body obeys to the intentions
of the mind

The Eyes of Set
"They are the grass, we are the blade
that reaps redemption.
Praise Set and join the stormt
hat will turn their hopes into dust".

11. Narcissism

The chalice is full of sea
fallen leaves upon her face
A map of green continents
Once part of the same tree
Away from where they belonged

Near sits a part of my twin moon
captured from the mirror waters

The sacred drink withdraws oblivion

This is the only way to meet
my full of craters sister
because her grim presence
stands always against
the golden rays of my sun.
How many friends I had,
how many enemies.
Now only absence
Love, its purest form is Narcissism
I remain and they remain through me
but only I exist.
Youth preserved, embalmed from history

In courts of exotic domains
sirens play with the strings of the rainbow
in a harmonious elegance
the story of a king.

1. The Future Belong To The Brave

Decline is the symptom of the failure to evolve forwards
Change was and will be the most permanent element of experience
deny to go on and you will be left back
Going backwards by remaining stagnant

We watch from our abodes
As hawks we cut the electric skies.
With pride
We keep the order, designing fate
We give access to countless futures...

A time of exodus will come.
The time to break out from the womb
And ships will lower down on Taia
On shining arks then we will go
On lands and stars forgotten...

The origin of riddles, what can restore the lunar wings
Is challenge of the underworld
For challenges to come, we will stand against the tide
Under the banner of the brave

Mission AIOEPIA, the future belongs to the brave
Decline is the symptom of the failure to evolve forwards
Change was and will be the most permanent element of experience

We watch from our abodes
As hawks we cut the electric skies.
With pride
We keep the order, designing fate
We give access to countless futures...

The origin of riddles, what can restore
The lunar wings is challenge of the underworld
For challenges to come, we will stand against the tide
Under the banner of the brave

Mission AIOEPIA, the future belongs to the brave


2. Ophidian Wheel

Where the crossroads meet is the axle
Of the grand wheel
The heart that reverberates my beat.

I wear the talisman of Thot,
The sign of our unity
Because it has a part of the universe
A part of me.

And my love is strong because nothing can divide
Me from the object of my ultimate affection.

The ophidian wheel

When the moon steals the crown from its rival
Night enters day. Bring forth the eclipse
The schism that reconstructs my lucid kingdom.

And all my children by their birth right
Wear porudly my crown, my horns of pwer
And those who sense my circle thoughts are all witnesses

3. Phallic Litanies

Welcome to the joyous carnival of passion
Where the mind surrenders to the animal.

Smell the seductive odor of the naked skin
Bathed in the exotic oils, the potions of desire.

It would be folly to defy the eldest law
For resistance will only supply the fire of lust
With her wooden excuses.

We are here to drink this old wine without remorse
To spill the fluid of Genesis
In abundance because we all know
That as this elixir of life will flow
We will be left exhausted but smiling.

Nails sink into sweaty ground
Marking dionysiac stings
Sparks set from velvet tongues
That bring close soft orange lips

Phallic litanies

Paths lead inside warm nests, that scared shrines of sin
As serpents we crawl beneath
The guises that we all wear.

It would be folly to defy the eldest law
For resistance will only supply the fire of lust
With her wooden excuses.
So it will grow stronger and stronger
Until fatally it will consume the renegades
With the flames of their denied satisfaction

Phallic litanies

4. Razor Blades Of Guilt

Hedonism, power in life without end
Morality and remorse banished
An epitaph of useless beliefs and countless mistakes
Left to the outcasts.
Those who were foudn guilty for self torment

Never admitting so, betrayed by their shiver
While mutilating their happiness
With razor blades of guilt

Their voices rise like an irritating whisper
To the AEONAON fortress
But there is no need for warriors
That can not win their own battles

Razor blades of guilt

No beggars are allowed in, to feast in sympathy
This treasure is kept and shared
With the beloved loyal comrades

Wearing the title of the trinity
Warlord, magician and king
Hands are raised grasping golden cups
In a toast for hedonism.
Power in life without guilt


5. Tartarus

6. On the Topmost Step Of The Earth

A stranger once whispered:
A fallen angel is someone not aware of his authentic identity
Because the fall occured nowhere except on the inner plains
And the broken wing was nothing but the bleeding memory

The creators of the prophecies
Have seen pages yet unturned
From a book that can not be read
Or expressed from mouths of scorn

Observing the divine marriage
Between the solid soil and the ether
Step on the lightnings and ascend

On the topmost step of the earth
Stepping on the belt that surrounds the sphere

Endless are the joys of the infinite quest
For the timeless explorer
And the child that lurks inside

On the topmost step of the earth
Solo: Chris
Stepping on the belt that surrounds the sphere

A billion toys to play, countless more to invent
In the mental playground, around its solid tree

The creators of the prophecies
Have seen pages yet unturned
From a book that can not be read
Or expressed from mouths of scorn
On the topmost step of the earth

On the topmost step of the earth...
Stepping on the belt that surrounds the sphere


7. Geometry In Static

Behold that a path is created from these traces of ink,
Letters join numbers
Sounds come forth manifesting the plasticity.
This is the direct outcome of the continuous war
The collision of the worlds of change and stability

One would sense the mind behind them
If only he could withdraw from the relentless alterations of its forms

I have swum against rivers of fallacy
Chaotic symmetry,
And have returned
From the point of weakness
To the root of triumph.

Between the circular entrances of spinning dark suns
I travelled with the company of a triangle
To the dark corners of cosmos

Geometry in static

In frozen wells I left my seal for the future travellers
Sunken trilithons bear my signature
In wombs of yellow on the phosphoric remnants
Of organisims with consciousness long erosed

One would sense the mind behind them
If only he could withdraw from the relentless alterations of its forms

Between the circular entrances of spinning dark suns
I travelled with the company of a triangle to the dark corners of cosmos

Geometry in static

8. Shamanic Rite

From inside a cloud with the shape of a grey owl
Scanning down the hill of an indian scared site
I can see a figure with hair white like the snow
The polar crystal breath.

Gyrating around the pyre like a planet in orbit
Around the burning mass of a life giving sun
Following the ways of the ageless
Parallel not our paths can cross
In a shower of meteor storm

As you have sung for me
Now I sing for you
As you have welcomed me
Now I welcome you

The shaman

From inside a cloud with the shape of a grey owl
Scanning down the hill of an indian scared site
I can see a figure with hair white like the snow
The polar crystal breath.

As you have sung for me
Now I sing for you
As you have welcomed me
Now I welcome you

The shaman

Let's take our place as stars in the night sky...

9. Heaven Below

A peacock rests alone in the vitreous valley
With an innocent pose like it does not know
On its featheres ventaglia thousands of eyes
Empty since the end of oracles

Clouds create a hollow pillow
For sleepy heads to rest
By denying to submit to the whims
Of their unstable paterns, I glide above them all

Heaven below

Light as a thought, dropping the weight of milleniums
How far can once reach
The answer depends on who this one is
How far can one extend
As far as his limits go...

Heaven below

1. Brotherhood Of The Fallen Knights

When alliance has the value
of a broken royal seal,
heroic is the denial to bent
to a flamboyant mighty siege.

Falcons are their arrows
like a forest seem their sheilds.
Catapults are spitting wrath
causing a waterfall of collapsing
castle walls.

In anvils was methodicaly forged
a diplomacy of the sword
A plot has provided the rope
to hang the bloody flag of war.

"Vow that no truce will stop the conflict"
Fierce if a purpose born from greed.
BROTHERHOOD OF THE FALLEN KNIGHTS
WITH THE EMBLEM OF THE MORNING STAR

Justified all actions must be
for honnor to rest untained.
Tomorrow has to car the lessons
that will nourish the naire.

"Vow that no truce will stop the conflict"
Fierce if a purpose born from greed.
BROTHERHOOD OF THE FALLEN KNIGHTS
WITH THE EMBLEM OF THE MORNING STAR


2. The Eldest Cosmonaut

SHINE......
In the mines of the darkest star.
The one no jewel can never shine.
A rode is left to point to Styx,
both its end can lead,both can deceive.

No traps can seize,THE ELDEST COSMONAUT
as time stands still,incapable to breathe.

Once in clay I allowed the decades
to become a stone wall around me
but at least I became the wall of decades.

Can you feel the wrinkles on my hand?
They are yours.They are lines I once
drew upon the sand...

I HAVE A BOAT UNSEEN A LABYRINTHINE SPHERE
THE GNOSIS OF THE ELDEST COSMONAUT.
AND MAYBE YOU WILL SEE
THAT I AM WHAT YOUR MIND CAN NEVER.....SEAL.

Travelling the luminiferous waters of space,
through the Stellar Isthmus.
It can lead it can decieve.

No traps can seize me,No toombs can seal me.

I HAVE A BOAT UNSEEN A LABYRINTHINE SPHERE
THE GNOSIS OF THE ELDEST COSMONAUT.
AND MAYBE YOU WILL SEE
THAT I AM WHAT YOUR MIND CAN NEVER.....SEAL.


3. Marble Smiling Face

Black leather gloves
on soft thin hands.
Red Celtic knives,
sharp as your touch.

HUNTING EAGLE PROUDLY LAND
ON THIS ISLAND THAT'S MY HEART.

Twin Mirrors blue.
Cold lakes consealing Fire.
Red coral hair.
A dazzling ruby dome

HUNTING EAGLE PROUDLY LAND
ON THIS ISLAND THAT'S MY HEART.
ELEGANCE COMBINED WITH GRACE
DRESSED YOUR MARBLE SMILING FACE.


4. Underworld (Act 1)

Tranquility...How necessary,how boring it can be.
The liquid void has no ears
to receive the consolation of the surface.

"MAYBE IT'S BETTER THAT WAY.
WHAT DOESN'T TOUCH DOESN'T HURT."

The innocence of a swan
gliding on a desolate lake
can't be sensed
and therefore can't bring jealousy.

Entire worlds full of wonder are banished
to rest only in few visionary minds,
haunting them with their glowing beauty.

Fortunately,there are always
those with the forked tongue
to bring the borders closer.

But there are also tribes of inferior beings,
beings so proudly inferior
necessary to give worth to the higher.
But not without cost...

They liberate ordeals.
Their negative thought is the fungus,
the grim vestment of the relic.

THE ERODING FRANKINCENCE OF MARASMOUS
CAN BECOME UNTOLERABLE.

Their region is warm like a blanket
but narrow as a coffin,
an UNDERWORLD.

Fortunately there are always
those with the forked tongue
that bring the borders closer...


5. Temple Of The Lost Race

Preserved from the ancient years
when Earth was just a newborn star
The proof of a distant truth
arrogantly stands mocking the wind
guarding mysteries that man has not unchained.

An emblem of power has remained , a fallen temple....

Faded pictures all over the walls
projecting a horrid state of sanity.
Figures that don't belong to a human race
Symbols and maps.
Architectural miracles carrying the history of a race
that now seems lost.

Fears born from the Past
TEMPLE OF THE LOST RACE
deep inside the heart of the pole
an old ruler of the stars

Buried in a chest from glass,
the answers about our path.
Eternal life can't rest asleep
it lurks beneath as force of will.
Ancient are the rules set on this world.

An emblem of power will remaine , a fallen temple....

Fears born from the Past
TEMPLE OF THE LOST RACE
deep inside the heart of the pole
an old ruler of the stars


6. The Crypt

In a dream i saw a man .
A face not strange to me.
He stared at me while i was asleep and wispered in my ear.
He led me through the corridors of my anscestral home.
He stoped one step before one wall, and then i fainted.

In the eldest wall of my home i found the entrance of a CRYPT.
The view i saw was so obscure,
alien remnants, pentagrams and candless of the floor.

THE CRYPT was made as a passage to the gates of reality.
And just when i realised the truth i was in a different shape.

I hear thousants of sounds
like bestial laughs,deafening flutes and daemonic choirs.
Possibilities fall under control, unfolding new dimensions.


7. Setting Of The Two Suns

In a world of endless light, into the boundless space
two suns the only gods, two burning holes in the sky.

Without a warning the two suns slowly faded
abandoning their only children unprotected from the cold.

Down on their knees.They have total consience,
as Night drains their spirit,the inner light of logic
leaving the bodies to walk this blind planet.
Stumbling to others that now are animals,crying light.......

SETTING OF THE TWO SUNS.......

Then a light came from the horizon
devouring the land.
It wasn't sun.!

It took a minute for a flame to become a fire.
The great cities will all become ashes ,
drifting with the wind.


8. Erebus

Waiting the drawing of the underworld
none to share your fears.
The shadow of CHARON falls
upon the stone of hopes.
The body is paralizing.
The air is too thick to enter.
a cataclysm is spawend into the regions of the soul.
The cry of the first time
when you were free from the womb,
is the same but now you are entering the night.

Most try to understand why they are born if they must die.
Life seems pointless with an end.
They wonder if existence remains after death
or EREBUS is the final state.

'' YOU KNEW FROM THE BEGGING
THAT THE END WILL COME IN TIME.
YET, SO MANY THINGS YOU LEFT UNDONE
SO MANY MORE UNKNOWN
IN A LIFE THAT IS BUT A DREAM
INTO A GODS DREAM."

Most try to understand why they are born if they must die.
Life seems pointless with an end.

"EXISTENCE IS A CHOICE THAT REMAINS AFTER DEATH
EREBUS IS MY MENTAL STATE."


9. Underworld (Act 2)

Our patience has been dried away
since a long time...
And the thirst,the need to unfold desire,
Transforming it into a touchable object.

How bitter was the taste of emptyness
in our illformed mouths
but it was natural as our ideas
was based on wishes younger,
Weed as fruits at first.

''YOUR FATHERS KNEW
THESE WORLDS BY HEART
EVEN THOSE THAT NEVER EVER CROSSED
THE EERIE SIDE.''

We came to see the upper world.
Where colours dance and the air moves bright
We came to see...

As a cat with her claws extended
orchestrates a merciless grasp,
weapons move damn swiftly
in an attacking stance,
ready to cut through
and open doors grimson.

"YOUR FATHERS KNEW
THESE WORLDS BY HEART
EVEN THOSE THAT NEVER EVER CROSSED
THE EERIE SIDE."

''LET ME HEAL YOUR WOUNDS WITH MINE
NOW THAT YOU HAVE DECEIVED THE NIGHT.''

"REST ASSURED THAT NONE OF US
WILL EVER LOSE THE WAY TO YOU.
THESE STAINS ARE ALSO TRACES
AND THEY CLEAN CONSCIENCE
AS IT IS THEIR DUTY TO DO SO.
THE ORDER WAS STRICT,
CONQUER OR BE CONQUERED."

Our patience has been dried away
since a long time...
And the thirst,the need to unfold desire,
Transforming it into a touchable object.

HOLD NO MORE YOUR HORSES
LET THEM RUN LIKE LAVA
MELTING STONE AND GRANITE
IN HOLLOW CAVES.

Raging Victory acts as shepherd
leading the way.

1. The Eldest Cosmonaut

The Eldest Cosmonaut
SHINE...
In the mines of the darkest star.
The one no jewel can never shine.
A rode is left to point to Styx,
both its end can lead,both can deceive.

No traps can seize,THE ELDEST COSMONAUT
as time stands still,incapable to breathe.

Once in clay I allowed the decades
to become a stone wall around me
but at least I became the wall of decades.

Can you feel the wrinkles on my hand?
They are yours.They are lines I once
drew upon the sand...

I HAVE A BOAT UNSEEN A LABYRINTHINE SPHERE
THE GNOSIS OF THE ELDEST COSMONAUT.
AND MAYBE YOU WILL SEE
THAT I AM WHAT YOUR MIND CAN NEVER...SEAL.

Travelling the luminiferous waters of space,
through the Stellar Isthmus.
It can lead it can decieve.

No traps can seize me,No toombs can seal me.

I HAVE A BOAT UNSEEN A LABYRINTHINE SPHERE
THE GNOSIS OF THE ELDEST COSMONAUT.
AND MAYBE YOU WILL SEE
THAT I AM WHAT YOUR MIND CAN NEVER...SEAL.


2. Underworld (Act III)

A millenium passed away, small forests became jungles, mountains were devoured from sand violently exiled from sand violently exiled from vast deserts with the help of hands made from storms.
It was as if someone wanted to erase the traces.
The triumphant laughs of liberation are forgotem.
The world that once seemed nes and vibrant turned pale and old.
Why?
Maybe because of the strange inhabitants were to eager to forget the path that led them through.

In their journey they were leaving behind not only spoken: not only part of their body but also part of their mind.
And they became so tired, all they demanded was to rest.
It wasn´t difficult.
There was not any apparent changes.
So a strange kind of sleep.
Fell among the lot.
The more they cultivated this habbit.
To seek in the deep matters of Lethargy.
The more their enviroment changed.
It was a curious transformation.
It was as if someone wanted to erase the traces.
Hoever there is one trace that will ever remain.
Week as a whisper it can reopen the way.
Just listen.
Your Fathers knew these words by heart even those that never crossed, the eerie side.


3. Underworld

4. Woman Of The Rings

Her mind is trapped as a bird in a golden cage in a neutral grey room
But while the others are content to hold their bars as shields, against my open asymmetry

She dives beneath the surface of what things are supposed to be, where thoughts avoid the rest.
Lay down the Earth, lay down the sky

Elishanth mistress of the wind
Ring the bell and the winter will be spring
Elishanth

Learned to expect the fall. No attempt to break the spell
Sad is the woman of the rings and I can cease her pain.

Ride on your silver horse to the deserts of the moon
Sing to the hunting wolves and fullfill your everlasting need for...

Pretend, that nothing can change and the next thing that you'll claim is that you did your best.
There is a voice heard only from the heart.
When she is ignored her cry is sadness.

Elishanth mistress of the wind
Ring the bell and the winter will be spring
Elishanth

1. Behold: The Land Of Promise

2. Unbeliever

Hate me
Help me
Convert my mind
Direct me to your gloom
The halls of kingdom
To the land of no return
Take me ignorant
Show me your master and creator

Take me
Take me to the tombs of your sacred relics
Where bodies bend like weak betrayers
What a fitting punisher you are
Bring your own redemption
The touch of the nails to the skin is the fruit of your love for masochism

I don't deserve your trance
I am the adversary of a dominant race of zealots
I am the kind that doubts the unreason

Unbeliever

I won't forget to ask the question before I give an answer to me
On the land of no return there are all that you can't find:
The lack of sense - The lack of anything that you can feel
I won't decide to play the master instead I chose to be
You say I am incomplete
I say I'll always be

Cover your mouth with tape
Cover your heart with pain
Cover your eyes with shame
Spend all your life in vain

I don't deserve your trance
I am the adversary of a dominant race of zealots
I am the kind that doubts the unreason

Hate me
Help me
Convert my mind
Direct me to your gloom
The halls of kingdom come
To the land of no return
Take me ignorant
Show me your master and creator

I don't deserve your trance
I am the adversary of a dominant race of zealots
I am the kind that doubts the unreason

Unbeliever


3. Virtues Of The Beast

Hail to those that walk my lonely path
Bearing the mark of the chosen one
They are the cross!
They are the travellers of the plains
Common ground of all directions
They lead to me
I lead to them

Never lie to me
The father of lies
Never deny your deeper desires
To all those true to me
Their instinct and mind
I grant
The Virtues of the Beast

Forged in fire
Iron wills of warlocks and witches nourish me
With their love they heat my broken wings
Making me strong
Lifting me up
Above the dream
Blessed are the restless minds
The angel tribes: for they shall inherit the earth
Blessed are the morning stars for
They shall burn the heavens with their Luciferian light

The Virtues of the Beast

Never lie to me
The father of lies
Never deny your deeper desires
To all those true to me
Their instinct and mind
I grant
The Virtues of the Beast


4. Faust

All my life I strived to gain insight to things that sacred most men
Through the dungeons of the mind I learned the tricks playing with fire
Evil wears a weird facade invented to protect man's hate
For the painful, The unknown, The feared and the forbidden

I dreamed the devil was I
My quest complete
I dreamed the devil was I
I was awake
My quest complete
Faust

Captive from philosophies that root on hopes like rotten trees
I see the hanged men on their ropes
Which harvester will rip these crops?
If their soul deserved a dime their chance is lost - No bargain now
I want now all that I can get
Riches, Power, Pleasure without end

I dreamed the devil was I
My quest complete
I dreamed the devil was I
I was awake
My quest complete
Faust
I dreamed the devil was I
Faust


5. When All Is None

So they promised you the stars
The happiness of your distant hopes
But as you tried to catch the moon
Its silver cape slipped through your fingers
Fake was the dawn of their mortality
You are drowning from the flow of your emotions

When all is none

There is a miracle for every soul
An easy way to loose control
The puppeteer and his dolls entertain the frantic crown
Invisible lands your stolen laughs
When all is none

When all is none

Who would be the most competent guardian for you
Than yourself?
Always in range
Under detention even at your sleep
Your life a white chalk on a small blackboard

When all is none
Die
When all is none


6. Red Code Cult

Equinox is at hand
The gates are now aligned
Raise the candles in the air and give the secret sign
The temperature is dropping down
Our breath seems now like smoke
The guardians of the shadow lands blind the heathen eyes

Our mental variation: a phantom made from light
With red we paint our fantasy until it breathes with might
Deciphering the code that releases the unknown
We make the wanted possible
Material like the stone
Red code cult

Welcome to our church disciples of the jackal
Your nature is key
Now raise the veils of the misty tyranny of the fake laws
Open the Choronzone

Our mental variation: a phantom made from light
With red we paint our fantasy until it breathes with might
Deciphering the code that releases the unknown
We make the wanted possible
Material like the stone
Red code cult


7. Dark River

Can you pay the fair?
Open your mouth and spit the buried coin
The boat is ready to sail
Step inside
I am the ferryman
We'll sail the river of woe
The Dark River
Dark River
On its brink is the end of hope
The Dark River
Acheron

And a wind blew like the breath of a dying man
And the waters spawned sounds
From the motion of slimy reptile tongues

My guests are many
And they won't leave this peaceful place of fading screams
Eyes shut
Gaze mesmerized at the circular form of zero
They sailed the river of woe
The Dark River
Dark River
They found the end of hope
The Dark River
Dark River
They found the end of hope
The Dark River
Acheron

On tunnels underground
chthonian delties mock
the icons that turned blank
The shades of the once beautiful

Can you pay the fair?
Open your mouth and spit the buried coin
The boat is ready to sail
Step inside
I am the ferryman
Acheron
Dark River
Acheron


8. Magic Loves Infinity

Desire manifests with endeavour
A form of spiritual eroticism
Magic is a goblet that seems hollow
A fountain strives to fill It to the brim

Magic loves infinity

A masquerade of visions so profoundly loved
Shroud the murky eyes of the sorcerers
Evoked from the vortex of their mind fields
As waves they spread in circles to reach the endless sea

Magic loves infinity


9. Sumerian Daemon

On the land between the rivers
where lions fly and serpents rule
I cross the road to the ziggurat
as darkness hides the moon
I came to seek the advice of Inanna
The goddess of love and war but the path is unclear
like the words of a Seer from the movement of the dunes

Windy whisperers come
From beyond the clouds
Descend with glory to the plane earth
Gas shaped nauseous forms hide behind the storm
As scorpions blended with the yellow red sand

Before me are the steps that lead to virtual ascension
A mystical technology
The temple of dimensions
The mysteries of Sumer manifest inside the chamber
that sits upon the top of this artificial mountain

Sumerian Daemon

My veins are black from the blood of Tiamat
My eyes are wide like the wheels of space and time
My will is strong like a blow from Marduk's sword
I am no human now because I choose to know

Sumerian Daemon


10. Mechanical Babylon

A malfunction to the machine
She chews its screws of sanity
Losing parts of human seed
As she lusts for electricity

Plastic attitude gray emotions
Wear your cables and join with me
Boring lives in entropy
Incorporeal surgery

Environmental therapy for the genes that threat security
A new breed of mass murderers
Instructed from their parents to do the task

Mechanical our whore Babylon

The old hag looks so young in her dress of silicon
A jungle in her heart made from concrete, glass and metal

Mechanical our whore Babylon

Her kiss of methadone
Is a drug that steals control
She wants her clockwork toy
Disconnected from the physical

Plastic attitude gray emotions
Wear your cables and join with me
Boring lives in entropy
Incorporeal surgery

Mechanical our whore Babylon

The old hag looks so young in her dress of silicon
A jungle in her heart made from concrete, glass and metal

Mechanical our whore Babylon


11. Infernal Sun

Silent but not alone
You are waiting for the dawn
To open the gates of the horizon
So that you can get through
The chasm that cuts in two
The worlds of now The worlds of ever

Casting your fiery arrows
A hunter among the stars
Up from your golden chariot
You throw the spear of time

Infernal sun

You act like a rightful tyrant
Casting away the cold
Your crown is the flame infernal
Eating the heat of soul

Infernal sun

Silent but not alone
You are waiting for the dawn
To open the gates of the horizon
So that you can get through
The chasm that cuts in two
The worlds of now The worlds of ever


12. The Watchers

The watchers learned to fly
and bridged the realms defined
The wealth was spreading far and wide
A sorcery divine

From the abode of heavens the seed of life was cast
Celestial orbs and fireballs from conflict fashioned lands
Nocturnal treasures glow and frozen crystals dance
The wealth was spreading far and wide
A sorcery divine

Fallen angels
They were called: the feared
The loved
The worshiped
They came to built the new empire
To make a land of promise

Protectors of the realms
These beacons in the sky
They warned about the cataclysm their sons that led mankind

Empire of the Watchers

From the abode of heavens the seed of life was cast
Celestial orbs and fireballs from conflict fashioned lands
Nocturnal treasures glow and frozen crystals dance
The wealth was spreading far and wide
A sorcery divine

The watchers learned to fly
and bridged the realms defined
The wealth was spreading far and wide
A sorcery divine


13. Shapeshifter

The transformation of the butterfly occurs in reverse
Beauty eaten abruptly from the ancient worm
Wearing sharp shard
Stolen from scattered
Broken mirrors
As a cloak to cover me

My strange images
nest as birds to the hearts of men
And as birds fly away
Taking their thoughts into oblivion
Disintegrating the elemental bonds
I obtain the rapture of the chameleon

When I become enraged
With the frenzy of the wolf on the hunt
I am the most cherished child of fear

Armed with fangs deadly like daggers
I am an adept on the skills of murder
I am the shape shifter

On the ruins of a ghostly projection
echoes the lust for life
An ancient purgatory for the sinister

Shape shifter

1. Lovecraft's Death

The cold comes
The rats in the walls break
The deadly sound of silence
As time decays
You try to name the unnamable
A whispererer in darkness

Our hound smells you
The haunter of the dark
Will come to take you to our realm
Your life, your books
March in front your closing eyes
Beyond the walls of sleep

Lovecraft in the realm of the dead

Obsessed with Necronomicon
The Arab's wicked dream
You found a path to Azathoth
And walked the Dagon's realm

Your friends were haunted too
Do you remember Charles?
Or haven't you heard
The music of Erich Zann
The call of Cthulhu we disguised
With notes and raving rhythms
To spread the seed of lurking fear
Into the heart of man

Lovecraft in the realm of the dead

Your time is out you saw too much
You used the silver key
You know too well that minds like yours
Can never rest in peace

You stared at the abyss
You'll never rest in peace

You'll never rest in peace


2. Anubis

Come
Approach
My trusty jackal's nose
Don't try to lie
Cause I can smell your hide

Leave your body
Leave this body now
Your face can stay
Upon this golden mask you made

The brave in heart
Can claim eternal life
My scales of truth
Will need sufficient proof

Their balance depends
On how your soul weights
To walk with Gods
The jaws of chaos you must pass

Anubis
My soul is so light
And as this feather I can fly

Anubis
Don't let me wither and die

I am proud for what I am
The guardian of the dead
Appointed by the gods
To be their final judge

Anubis
Don't let me wither and die


3. Communion

Alien faces
Watching me
Wearing wings
They come to drink

The ancient chalice
Raised so high
In a toast to those who fly

Fallen angels burn the night
Touch me with your hungry eyes

Send your thoughts between the realms
Sharing your eternal dreams

Communion

Some have seen your trembling lights
Dancing in the cloudy night
You appear as strange machines
Changing form, to fit the scene

Demons, angels, poltergeists
Laughing as they play with minds
Altering the face of truth
So that seems as lie to fools

Communion

There are things that can't be seen
They are the things that lurk within
If you seal the mystic bond
You will never be alone...

"I wear your horns with shameless pride
As a nailed crown
Upon the severed head of a king."

Watching...

Communion
Slay the false king
And claim the throne


4. Babel's Gate

You build a tower
A giant mountain
Opened a God's gate
To reach the heavens
Only power
Rules this stargate
You make a statue
A golden idol
Holding his sword high
It will be placed up
Only power
Rules this stargate
All want the power
Now all divided

You speak your words loud
And cannot hear
What the others try to say
Blind confusion
Tongues now slay
Words are burning

Babel's gate
Human's reign
Babel's gate
Sky is on flames
Babel's gate
All in vain?
Babel's gate
Nothing same

Only power
Rules this stargate
All want the power
Now all divided

You speak your words loud
And cannot hear
What the others try to say
Blind confusion
Tongues now slay
Words are burning


5. We The Gods

We, the gods - we, the gods - live high - to the heavens - right above your heads
We, the gods - we, the gods - hide well - it's so difficult to find us
Don't ever claim we are dead - we rest here and we guide you
You need to be controlled - so yes, we will direct you
Betrayers of our faiths - must pay the higher price
Damnation for the weak - salvation for the faithful
You pray and call our names - and think that we will hear you
Maybe, you don't deserve - an audience with your masters
We, the gods - we, the gods send dreams - to the humans of our choice
We, the gods - we, the gods - give signs
And you must recognize them
We, the gods - we, the gods - save lives
But we demand some sacrifice
We, the gods - we, the gods
Praise love - but also we know war
Hold the spear - face our enemy - abandon yourself - to the storm of the battle
We came in here - to live forever - we smell your flesh - and we smell your fear


6. Sunlight Moonlight

Yesterday as I closed my eyes
My weight was left behind, the body paralyzed
It was a miracle, I floated as a ghost
And there I saw my self lying upon my bed

I stared down, I looked up
Then tried to pass the walls and drift to the unknown
It was the strangest call, as if I heard a soul
I felt the need to find a creature bleeding light

Sunlight / Moonlight

I climbed the sky, above the clouds
And there I saw some more
That answered to the call
Bright shining disks of light
With wings made from the night
The day had yet to come
And so a hunt begun

As my sun is now reborn
My mind awakes, the body is on
Remembrance will hold the door
Until the night will send her call

Sunlight / Moonlight


7. Persepolis

Flutes and pipes / Play a drunken rhyme
Entertaining / The soldiers in the palace

Naked bodies / Female slaves from Asia
Dance with promise / For a night of pleasure

Mouths smell wine / The feast is going wild
Victorious and glorious / The men exalt their king
As in a fevered dream / Thais is entering
And she provokes him / To do a special deed

"You have conquered / The capital of orient
Display your power / And make your enemies weep
Destroy their pride / The jewel of the desert
As they once destroyed / Our temples for their king"

"Burn this city to the ground
Take a torch and spread the fire"

Persepolis / Now a pile of dust
A blackened carcass / A land of ash

Persepolis / You lost your crown
Persepolis / Burned to the ground

Consumed by hate / Ablaze by pride
Persepolis / Naked as the sand

Persepolis
You lost your crown
Persepolis
Burned to the ground

"Burn this city to the ground
Take a torch and spread the fire"

8. Sangreal

There's a sacred ancient cup
Filled with royal bluish blood

Sangreal, how real

In a family of light
Darkest secrets hide from eyes

Sangreal, how real

The elder blood
Still runs on the veins
The modern body
A cup from our skin

Dragon share your mystic soul
With your children
Make them strong

Sangreal, how real

In a family of light
Darkest secrets hide from eyes

Sangreal, how real

Immortal show your fangs
Reveal your hungry faces
Blood needs blood
Flesh needs flesh
Life for life, soul for soul

Immortals...

There is no hope
For the followers of lies
There is no hope
For the weak in the mind

Sangreal, how real

Sangreal...

9. Narcissus

On the walls of Venus's temple
The tale of Narcissus and Echo
A beautiful young nymph
Sentenced to repeat
The last words of the others
Never to talk first

She fell in love with Narcissus
And followed him longing to speak
He said "Who is here" and she replied "Here"
He called for her saying "Come"
She just replied "Come"

As none came near, Narcissus
Called her again
"Why do you shun me"
She could only say the same

These words hurt deep
His pride his actions leads
"I would rather die
Than you should have me"

Narcissus went forth
To a fountain in the north
He kneeled down to drink
And then he fell in love

He said "Who is here"
His voice kept sounding "Here"
He called again the one
That couldn't ever come

His face was young and
In the crystal waters glowed
His smile was cold reflecting
Back a thought

"I would rather die
Than you should have me"

1. Dante's Inferno

Threatening and cold
A poem for the underworld
Where shadows walk
Beyond redemption

Dante's Inferno
Dante's Inferno

Minos wraps his serpent
Tail around himself
To mark a sinner's level
His prison cell.
The famous poet Dante
Is passing through the gates
The only living being
In this accursed place.

Threatening and cold
A poem for the underworld
Where shadows walk
Beyond redemption

Dante's Inferno
Dante's Inferno

The greedy pay the price,
Their wealth is cursed
The wrathful fight each other,
Covered with slimy mud
The flames are burning heretics,
And for the violent ones,
Red blood is boiling.
As thieves will turn to vipers
And vipers will turn to thieves

Ninth, the lower plain.
Who could ever guess?
It is a frozen lake!
An angel in his past, a fallen one,
Right on the spot he crashed,
For aeons is lying down...


2. 3rd Testament

"At last, the final volume in the mega popular "Testament" trilogy.
The concluding book "Codex Omega" is far better than the last book "New Testament".
Although it reads somewhat like a cross between the first and second book in the plot and overall feel, it is a very enjoyable read and a better conclusion that wraps everything up, with a surprising twist at the end…"

A human has written all books.
A human mind has thought of the "proof".
To rule the earth, he had to ascend.
To rule his peers, their will he had to bend

Bibles are portraying a world in black and white.
We invented the devil, so the devil is man!

If Satan was the father and Antichrist the son,
Lilith was the mother and Lucifer the spirit of light.

Reversed is the 3rd Testament
The 3rd Testament
The 3rd Testament

A phantom god guarding your salvation.
He lives in books, your imagination
An abstract thought, lord of all creation
An absent king, the final revelation

If Satan was the father and Antichrist the son,
Lilith was the mother and Lucifer the spirit of light.

Codex Omega…


3. Portrait Of A Headless Man

"What could be more simple and more complex, more obvious and more profound than a portrait?"

In a world controlled by fire..
In a world controlled by fire,
Psychotic preachers thrive.

They use the waves to bind us,
They use the screens to blind us.
I joined headless forces
They told us what to do.
We worked, we fought, we bled.

A cogwheel in the system,
A ghost in the machine.
In my private thoughts,
Only pain felt real.

Cry!
I am crying, in the portrait
Of a headless man.
Laugh!
I am laughing, in the portrait
Of a headless man

I am a man with strong regrets.
I followed great deceivers
Believed in headless leaders.
They played their game, true sons of Cain
But I was a hopeless dreamer,
With my head deep in the clouds.

More joined the fiery leaders,
And blood was shed in rivers.
Those without a mind had to pick our side,
With the use of fearsome methods.
One more empty frame ready for display,
On a gallery of headless portraits.

Cry!
I am crying, in the portrait
Of a headless man.
Laugh!
I am laughing, in the portrait
Of a headless man


4. Martyr

"In memoriam of Hypatia, a great mathematician, philosopher and astronomer, murdered at 415 A.D. by order of Cyril the Bishop of Alexandria.
Cyril later was declared a saint by the church…"

Your books, your friends, your life is in mortal danger.
The things are tense and knowledge is offense.
In this nation vast deception reigns.
Church and politics threaten your survival.

A strife has grown between faith and wisdom.
You chose to stand for the exalted ego.
Your creation, a creation maimed.
Blame the vultures and their vile way.

The mob: "Run Devil's seed! You will face the wrath of God.
Run Devil's seed! You will face the wrath of God
Run Devil's seed!"

You will face the wrath of God.
The highest price you'll pay.
You will face the wrath of God.
The highest price you'll pay.

Martyr
Unyielding force of thought and spirit.
Martyr
Unyielding force of thought and spirit

Your essence remained.
Your work, your life, your books.

Unyielding force of thought and spirit, shine!


5. Enemy Of Truth

"Every Superstate has one iron rule: logic is an enemy and the truth is a menace."

The silent borderland
Where words become undone
Brainwave, treachery
A different truth to see
To keep a secret
Misinformation is the key
Twenty first century
New ways of slavery
So many prying eyes
Communication spies
Ghosts are fighting for the cause
With poisoned words
Half truths, false proofs
The trap is set to snare the wolf
The enemy of truth
Fight the enemy of truth
Fight the enemy of truth

Mental surgery
Social lobotomy
Confusion, delusion
We all connect and share
The perfect way for lies to spread
Fight the enemy of truth
Fight the enemy of truth


6. Dark Art

"Life begins and ends with a breath.
The art of sound is an art in darkness, unseen, yet real as the wind."

Blessed be the night, the architect of all creation.
Her wings are wide and strong and black.
She is bleeding light. Stars form a congregation
She is the force, our soul and fire.

Blind lead the blind.
Another day
The sun is lost.
Nocturnal cities
Secrets lie buried in the sand.

To craft the dark art we used our soul.
Emotions bleed, but we stay strong.

Disciples of the Dark Art.

To craft the dark art, we used our soul.
Emotions bleed, but we stay strong
Darkness binds the world!

Save me!
Another day
The sun is lost
Save me, strong wind.
Strong and bitter and cold and old


7. Our Church, Below The Sea

Gothic walls below the sea.
Corals rising high.
A building is standing tall,
Fearful, yet majestic.

Surface dwellers never come,
Yet it haunts their dreams.
Tales about Atlantis come to mind.

When the waters kiss
The mouth of madness
And the sea is chanting,
Horrid fish come as guardians
For our church
Our church, below…

Hail! Cthulhu lives.
He escaped the abyss.
Hail! Cthulhu dreams
Of his house in the deep
Hail! Cthulhu lives.
He escaped the abyss.

Placed upon the ocean's floor,
On the abyssal zone.
Sunlight cannot get down here
And freezing currents flow.
Rusting chandeliers
Are hanging from above.
Chthonian priests
Are praying to elder gods.

When the waters kiss
The mouth of madness
And the sea is chanting,
Horrid fish come as guardians
For our church
Our church, below the sea.

Hail! Cthulhu lives.
He escaped the abyss.
Hail! Cthulhu dreams
Of his house in the deep.

When the waters kiss
The mouth of madness
And the sea is chanting,
Horrid fish come as guardians
For our church
Our church, below the sea.


8. Faceless Queen

"The face of Tiamat, like the ocean's surface, is but a reflection of an ever-changing sky."

Always so distant.
Hiding from the sun.
He is looking around her,
To find where she is not.

The archway of Heaven,
The saints of the Earth,
Old parts from her broken ribs.
Now she is enthroned
On the spaceless void.
She is breathing fire as a dragon
And we all feel the heat.
Her touch is soft as the wind.

Faceless Queen
A mask your only skin
Faceless queen
Faceless queen,
Can you remove,
Your mask of skin?

She is enigma,
A canvas without frame.
Worshiped as Goddess
By the toys she made from clay.
Behold the Faceless Queen!
Behold the Faceless Queen!

Her realm extends to the endless sea
And she rules from the spaceless void.
She is breathing fire as a dragon
And we all feel the heat.
Her touch is soft as the wind.

Faceless Queen
A mask your only skin
Faceless queen
Faceless queen,
Can you remove,
Your mask of skin?

The serpent with the golden crown,
Faceless staring at the sun.
The serpent sits upon its throne,
Faceless staring at the sun.

Always so distant.
Hiding from the sun.
He is looking around her,
To find where she is not.

Behold the Faceless Queen!
Behold the Faceless Queen!

9. The Gospels Of Fear

"What you keep feeding with strong emotions and thoughts, is growing inside your mind, until finally it starts feeding by itself…"

Your future life can be at stake.
From good to worse.
Make no mistake!
One moment here, the next one gone.
The seed of terror soon will grow.

We learn to live with fear each day.
It has to be another way.
As moments fly, the things we want will be obtained,
Or maybe not.

ACTH, epinephrine,
Are flowing through the bloodstream.
The fear of failure
The fear of death
The fear of loss
The Gospels of Fear
Embrace fear

A grim companion is always there.
His vicious thoughts are hard to bear.
In every mind, in every soul he gains control.

He offers help but in exchange you have to step inside the cage.
Dare not to question the things you'll see,
All kind of horrors you will perceive.

Toxic thoughts come to thee,
Vicious mouths eating thee.

The Gospels of Fear

Embrace your fear.

10. Trinity

Brahma/Vishnu/Shiva – Creator/Preserver/Destroyer.
Father/Son/Holy Ghost – Mind/Body/Spirit.
Past-Present-Future.

I am the abyss,
I am the way,
The secret door to a hidden cave.
A different place to the garden of fools.
You can enter here, if your steps will lead you to…

Thoughts are sailing fast, like ships into a storm.
Dreams are fading; they are heading to a point of no return.

You can call me Trinity, as three divide the whole.
One third of me, is what you see.
A mirror is my astral door.

Trinity
Remember what you always have been.
Trinity
The one that is three.
Trinity
The one possessed by three.

11. Martyr Of Truth

12. Dark Testament

1. Carpathian Forest

Three times the eclipse.
Before she lay her soul to rest.
Channeling the darkness of many nights,
All this was once her dream.

See and feel,
The blackened blade of revenge.
Cold white towering mountain,
The passage to the land of the phantoms,
Deep forlorned woods,
Where the gleam of neither light or bliss reach.

"The castle lies in the mist,
Between the mountains and marshes.
Through the last centuries,
Have the moonshine enlighten her coffin.
The black soul of the hunter..."

The hungering thirst,
For the enchantress of the night.
The hungering thirst,
Evil, devour its soul.

And since the medieval times,
Have your shadows haunted...


2. The Pale Mist Hovers Towards The Nightly Shores

Eternally sounds the mighty waves,
A triton's hymn round a rock-strewn grave,
The passing sigh for the bones that moulder,
Over the nordic black sea, where the winds btew colder.

Here in a bed of wrack and shingle,
Beneath rests a sea king of the north,
His fallen history remains unknown,
Now his grave is just a heap of stones.

"The waves crest sharp as an unsheated blade,
As spume-topped breakers shorewards loom,
And boulder on boulder on land is laid,
The triton's hymn round a vanished tomb"

The ocean cradles it's sleepy wave,
Round the curve of the yellow sand.
Of the bleak and mysterious little isle,
Where no leaf has been touched by human hands.
Then I behold that island so fair,
Where the tree's lift their crown in prayers
To the golden glow of the evening sky
I hold the sword towards the moon,
my memories echoes with cries.
Hark, to the ocean's cold clamerous roar,
The pale mist hovers towards the nightly shores.
For the fire in my burning flame,
Hail to the father of the fallen flame.

Acknowledge the supreme Northern (racial) purity.
That runs in the blood of my veins.
As the nocturnal curtain falls
With the total eclipse of the moon above...

The pale mist hovers towards the nightly shores.


3. The Eclipse / The Raven...

Once upon a midnight dreary. while I pondered, weak and weary
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore-....
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one, gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
'Tis some visitor' I muttered, tapping at my chamber door....
Only this and nothing more....

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
and each seperate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow... Vainly I had sought to borrow
from my books surcease of sorrow.... Sorrow for the lost Lenore-...
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-...
Nameless here for evermore...


4. When Thousand Moon Have Circled

The vast windswept wastelands,
Cold horizons opens.
Many traveller has set their course from here,
Few of them have returned.

The utter darkness,
Bleak visions of emptiness,
And the veil to this portal,
Lies in your own belief....

When thousand moon has circled,
In the shadow of endless nights,
The wage of eternal life.

Among the old tree's,
As the dust covers every flower in bloom,
The mourner hide their eyes,
To reap the seeds and harvest.

Withering flowers of the northem autumn,
Shall never thrive again.
The time has ceased,
Now my dreams are true....


5. Journey Through The Cold Moors Of Svarttjern

Ahh, Dance through the cold shadows of Pan
as tears fall from heaven...
once I had hold the rarest rose,
But, that is now forgotten with time...

Among the tree's I wandered,
To feel the embrace of etemal eclipse
as my candle bums out,
-And we must make the myths...

Dark is the moon at harvest,
the nightly mist approaches
through the forlorned marshes,
-Then darkness has now been achieved...

"Crush your earthly virtnes,
As I stumbled through snow and frost
my feeble heart is longing for the wood,
where all dark cast a shadow...."

It's pale morrow landscape,
Has now risen through the bleak night
over the moors and mountains,
Flies the hunting ravens..., searching,

Dance through the cold shadows of Pan,
As tears fall from heaven,
Then, once I had hold the rarest rose...

Frozen is my pagan heart,
And once again the dawn is here
hear the sound of silence,
In these trees....
Are my gallows....

1. Black Shining Leather

Deep red,
Face soaked in blood.
Black shining leather.
I fuck you up in sadistic intent.

Whore
I plunge into the wastelands of my heart
And left it there in ruins.
The sun shines once a lifetime.

I will leave you in the cold.
In the dead of the night,
Black leather and latex Queen,
A lush of the world.

The bitter taste of life,
And the coldness
of my heart.

Cunt
I plunge into the wastelands of my heart
And left it there in ruins.
The sun shines once a lifetime.


2. The Swordsmen

From the thunder and the storm
Another winter has sneaked upon me again.
There's something strange going on here
on these great cold coastals lines.

The grim vision of Chaos
upon mankind
and life itself.
Nights of black candles
and gallons of strange old brew.
Changing suit into gold.
(Repear verse 1)
The grip of frost
and the winds from the north.
Lurking beneath
the surface of the coastal horizon.

Banners of War.
Banners of the Apocalypse.
Hatred towards mankind and life itself.
Violence is fashion

The graveyard soil is changing to stone,
so many of its deaths had been midvinter.
The blinding snowdrifts.
The subzero temperature.


3. Death Triumphant

A cold sharpened blade
plunge through the skin.
Death triumphant.
Death the king

Blood on my hands.
Blood on my lips
I took the frail bliss of your eyes
and its darker than you think...

I violate.
I come at night.
My great endurance of body, mind and heart

Let me take you through...
A gust of wind.
Torrent of rain.
Blood and semen
Murder is art
The cold blade.
The cold blade.


4. Sadomasochistic

Whipped and pierced,
you disbehave.
Underneath the whip
to soothe the beast

Burn a candle from my soul,
for I will never do the same.
Cause I see beauty in another things
and that is light is the wilderness alone.

Kneel before me
and shine my shoes.
I give you much
but you want more

I am the long arm of unforgivingness.
Beholder of all chains.
This tool of great destruction.
This life of feces and filth.

Pick up your teeth with broken fingers.
Lick the blood of your cracked lips.
The colour purple seems to fit you
Bow down...


5. Lupus

6. Pierced Genitalia

The toes that you step on today may be
connected to the ass you'll be kissing tommorow.
These feelings are left from you.
Like a vast burning field
and then you submit yourself to me.
Perversion of the flesh.

With needles in thin skinned places.
The warm blood of life poured on the floor,
but who gives a shit when your life is a plague.
A rollercoster ride of pain.

I saw the white in your eyes.
Beat me, she said.
Cruel, violent shotgun love.
I kill you, point blank range.

I drank too much of the midnight wine,
disregardless of whatever i claim my throne.
Your voice kept ringin in my ears
like little echoes from yesterdays.

I did not want,
I did not feel.


7. In Silence I Observe

At the great wood's mouth,
by the deep cave's door.
I listened to something
I had heard before.

The wood's mouth.
In a field I am the absence.
Wherever I am
I am what is missing.
And in silence I observe

When I walk I part the air
and always the air moves in.
To fill the spaces
where my body has been...

I close my eyelids.
There was nothing more to say.
I've seen it all before.
But, I find comfort in silence,
summer melacholia.
The air shivered against my skin.
Dark leaned into my eyes.

Those threatening clouds.
The sweet music of the summer rain.
The mist in early hours.
The dominant winds.


8. Lunar Nights

My associates have denied Christ.
Earthly, heavenly and hellish.
The only guiding light
to you rejoice to see blood flow.

I've know rivers.
I've known rivers ancient as the world
and older that the flow
of human blood in human veins.
My soul has grown deep like those rivers old.

Away under the wings with dark faces
The rulers of the night.
The goddes of Death
I, drinker of blood.

It is nothing to mourn for
It is the other world.
Do you deserve this?
Hell no!!!

What a tangled web you weave.
Over and over the whips of the world..


9. Third Attempt

Come death
before it slips through my hands.

Like long-drawn echoes merging far away
to a deep and pounding harmony.
Vast as the night and as vast as light.
Scents, colours and sounds to each other reply.

Your wounds are infected
and life neglected.
These are the autumn years.

Haunted nights of ghosts and shadows.
You cut the wound to release the pus.
You cut your wrist.
You do not wish to live
and kissed the world bloodred.

Through coldness.


10. The Northern Hemisphere

The night is cold and brilliantly clear.
Peak after peak of glorius ice mountains
rose into the dome of the darkened skies.
Jagged crystal teeth queezed between
the depths of the jet-black fjords.

The mountains lost their sharpness and became
soft and blue-tinged as the great winter day.
Which would grow on to be a dim twilight
that glimmered slowly to life.

Above the peaks the Polar sky flickered with
the ghostly radiance of the northern light.
A frozen lake discharge into an equally frozen stream.
The cold is cruel and unforgiving like the landscape.
Up north.


11. A Forest

Come closer and see
See into the trees
Find the girl
If you can
Come closer and see
See into the dark
Just follow your eyes
Just follow your eyes

I hear her voice
Calling my name
The sound is deep
In the dark
I hear her voice
And start to run
Into the trees
Into the trees

Into the trees

Suddenly I stop
But I know it's too late
I'm lost in a forest
All alone
The girl was never there
It's always the same
I'm running towards nothing
Again and again and again and again
1. Bloodcleansing

Blood, sweat and more blood
Love turned to hate
Light turned to dark
And life turned to death

Blood!
The old engine is still running
Cleansing!
The cleansing of the body and soul

(Then) reach out and touch the branches
The branches of the oldest oak
In these last autumn days
When dim colours are over whelming
And grim

Cold hills darken
Frost is setting in
Discover something old
Discover something new

You have everything to fear
You're hated here


2. Mask Of The Slave

10 times the power
10 times the pain
He rolls you over
And rape what remains

He exists in every town
He is all around
He stab you where it hurts
Up under your miniskirt

Something never never changes
Something never will
He loves the fire

He degrade
He deprive
He is the judge and jury
Of your miserable life

You are his toilet seat
You are beneath his feet
With this spiked device
He rapes you twice


3. Martyr / Sacrificulum

Weaklings,
You are not the only one
Dreamers,
I wish you were all gone

Losers of faith
Grievers of the heart
All the purity of sin
Inner strength
To die for a cause
A martyr's death
An old conscience
Cleansed in blood

A burning obsession
A cold hearted devotion
See into the eyes of evil
And see through the eyes of hell

Losers of faith
Grievers of the heart
All the purity of sin
Inner strength
To die for a cause
A martyr's death
An old conscience cleansing in blood


4. Thanatology

The cold hands were yours
The stiff face was yours
But you were not there
The eyes were yours, but they were closed
And would not open
The rays of the distant sun were there
The moon on the hills white shoulder

The trip of death, into the unknown
Silent and numb
The human mind, a vast universe
Dive into darkness

Falling further down in despair
The silent watcher of truth
You have lost your battle once, the quest of man
God given immortality
Pain strikes, the horror in their eyes
Rigor mortis, the death stiffness

The trip of death into the unknown
Silent and numb
The human mind a vast universe
Dive into darkness


5. The Suicide Song

Come on dead man
You have slit your wrist
Bow down dead man
And slit your wrist again
Cut!!! Cut!!!

Razorblade baby
Kill yourself girl
You Christian women
You can't live like this
No!!! No!!!

He's flung high, he's flung low
But he still loves the purgatory glow
This long road leads to you
Feel the anger feel the rush
Search your heart
And get out before all heaven breaks loose
The blood hunger
The addiction
Night, cold night
The stars are not lit tonight

Ice bound river banks
Cold murky waters
The treacherous devilry
Coldest thoughts
Suicide!!!

The blood hunger
The addiction
Night cold night
Suicide!!!
Suicide!!!


6. House Of The Whipcord

In this house that I built
Of cold emotions
Through years of oppression
The suffering which I obey
An unbearable suffering
The rope
The strangulations
The whip
Total submission

In this room that I built
Of devilish lust
A tyrant's possession
Unleashed at dusk
Chained at dawn
Deprivation, solitude
Perfection, lust

In this world that I built
Of no emotions
I whip the skin
I taunt the angel
Forever
And ever
Again
And again


7. Cloak Of Midnight

The trail I walk is haunted
By his blinding light

Somewhere
Down there
For eternities undefeated
Unwanted
Untouched
The evil incarnate

The cloak of midnight
Screams are strong
Around the oppressed

Like a blizzard
Like a whirlwind
Like the long lost divinity!
It falls heavy like a stone
I am what I am
Spill the blood one more time

The trail I walk is haunted
By his blinding light

Cloak of midnight


8. Return Of The Freezing Winds

In the night the forest lies cold
Longing for the north wind to return
Hear the sad whisper of the wind
Blackened clouds cover the crescent moon
Evil lords ride the tempest wings
Cursed is the soil of the pathetic fools
The winds of mayhem have returned
To the infernal land of the forest
The return

Dark is the shadow of the reaper
His cold embrace of melancholy
Illuminated are the old roots of evil
Hear the grim anguished cries

Frozen millennium of the evil usurper
From the dark caves of the forest
Freezing winds sweeps the autumn meadow
This is the hellstorm of our infernal ways

The return of the freezing winds


9. He's Turning Blue

He hung himself in the middle of the night
Found dead in the morning bright light
Got no more lithium
Gave up life
They say: you better give up now
Its not worth the strife
The soul constipation

He's turning blue
He's turning blue
He's turning blue
He's turning blue
And nobody cares

He withered
He's not the only one
Come on get it over with
You're not the only one

He's turning blue
And nobody cares

1. Fever, Flames And Hell

On a battlefield up north
Tons of steel united in bloodshed
Sombre men of invisible might
The fallen snow covers
All the wounds of the earth

Slaves of restriction
Remains this skeleton earth
The dust kills all sound
We're sucked into a black hole
The eyes that watched
From the top of the hill
The eyes that capture human guilt

A stiff vulture claw shows the way
To a land of mist
To a land of war
Night of torment
Fever, Flames and Hell
In the cold grip of Armageddon

2. Doomed To Walk The Earth As Slaves Of The Living Dead

You are born into bondage
You are born as a slave

What am I?
"You're a slave"
Forever submissive
Forever in holy chains

(You are) born by a whore
By a filthy cunt
Which spread disease
The disease of god

You have the ability to rise
After a fall
We await impatiently
For a divine sundown

You're a slave
Of your own restrictions
Of Christian morals
Of the book of lies

You have the ability to rise
After a fall
We await impatiently
For a divine sundown

You're a slave
Of your own restrictions
Of Christian morals
Of the book of lies

Stop being so humble
Stop showing remorse
Cut it off
The hands that feed the blind
Can you move?
With those holy chains

The grey horizon
I paint it black
See through tomorrows
Spiteful eyes

The fury of the north men
(within) those who still believe
The holy slumber must end
(After) Thousand years of dormancy

3. Morbid Fascination Of Death

Lifeless landscapes
Dead trees up in the hills
Pure autumn bliss

In cold November
On a night of gusting wind
Clouds came down - down

Together we were beasts
We lay in the cold dusk -
Of his negligence
In the mist of the turmoil

Frozen heart
Beast of winter
Mental frost
Beast of winter
Mental frost


4. Through Self-Mutilation

The self-mutilation
Necrosis of the soul
Dark is the shadows of life
Hot as Hell

You take the matters into your own hands
From now on it's downhill
A single candle burns -
In the vast consuming darkness
Uplifting like a funeral

Through these years you were created
In the void between life and death
A shimmering blade shreds through his flesh
At the peak of his night - time bliss
Misanthropes, kings and queens
And a painful vision of Hell

It burns
The blisters on your hands
So nebulous, dark as December

You should be dead by now
Lost in time and space
But you push the limits further
You hate the human race

6. Warlord Of Misanthropy

I have died from within
The beginning of an end
But I still stand
Seeing red
The anger made me strong

The vision was mine
Horizon becomes vast
Claim your throne
The fire turns to flames

I had it all
Before the fall
Warlords of misanthropy
Powers
Spiritual powers to foresee
Warlords of misanthropy

Warriors of the fall
Through sinful years
The hellish burden
That I was given:


7. A World Of Bones

An evil face
The eyes so cold
The dark labyrinth of the human mind

Key to a kingdom
A world of bones
New revelation, anger is the fuel

I am a sinner
On the last dreadful day of judgement
Heaven
I unbind all spirits who
Abide this hole
In symbols speaking
I woke you from the deepest dream

Open the gates
Behold your sentence
In the sign of the cross
And the crown of thorns

The precious (human) blood
Burning holy tears
Lifetime sinner
Which saw his sign
But the eyes were cold


8. Carpathian Forest

Three times the eclipse
Before she lays her soul to rest
Channelling the darkness of many nights
All this was once her dream

See and feel
The blackened blade of revenge

Cold white towering mountains
The passage to the land of phantoms
Deep forlorn woods
Where the gleam of neither light or -
Bliss reach

The castle lies in the mist
Between the mountain and marshes
Throughout the last centuries
Have the moonshine enlightened her coffin

Black soul of the hunter

The hungering thirst
The enchantress of the night
The hungering thirst
Evil, devour its soul
Since the medieval times
Have your shadow haunted:


9. Cold Confort

A spirit rose from the earth
Slowly leaving...
Their candle-flame lonely, and so needing
Like dust in the night the prayers rise
Under the sick image of Christ
They talk to the nothingness
Old wounds were never mended

Something drops from the (autumn) leaves
Again it rains:
In a dry corner, salvation again declines
Sleep like a skull in the hard ground
Nothing for ears nothing for eyes
Without a shadow, waiting for nothing
The dark room, the moist tenement (of earth)

The cold kiss of release, great light
He was never man enough
In a world of cruel faces
He discovered that he was never man enough
He discovered nothing
Far above and beyond...
All in the name of god
The eyes refused to look ahead...


10. Speechless

When we came through
The veil of the night
The fall of man
We gave you our hearts

The watcher
The sentinel
The "God" that took you away

Where ends our journey?
We slip away
And shadow falls

We gave it all
You found no god
Mankind will forever weep!!!

11. Nostalgia

From the ashes he returns
Through the seal of the dark
He looks upon the enchanting moon
His lips are dry
And crave for human blood

Through all centuries
We see the horizon clearly
Deep in our hearts
Under the shelter of a tree

It lives in the well of time
The ancient dread of non-existence
Close your eyes, it leads the way
(To the) Treasure throne of memories

This is the emptiness
This is life
Make a final sign
(And) Leave the world behind

1. The Angel And The Sodomizer

A young catholic nun
Fucked up by a stun-gun
Life will not be like before
Scream, you Christian

Whore
Shoot it out
Don't resist
He'll Sodomize
He'll slit your wrist

You are a fragile flower
So innocent and pure
Feel it in your bowel
Calls tight rectums bleeds for

Sure
Crying out
In misery
Stinging pain
Oh yeah!!!

Gather the hordes of hell
Gang Bang virgin Mary
666 Seconds in hell
Destination death

Crucified through the wrists
Naked teenage tits
Diabolical religious fanatic
Heavy downer pills and
Heroin addict

You have met the devil
A devil in disguise
Diabolical destroyer
(Just) Look into his eyes...

This is a little bonus
(For the) Perverter of the soul
Bleeding from the anus
Now you're stiff and cold


2. I Am Possessed

Bleed!!

I am possessed!

Enough is enough
You're going down
We're destroying all
Holy ground!!

This is hell, this is war
Death, torture, bloodshed
And gore...

Still burns the church
Of faith
And carpet bombed is the
PEARLY GATES!!!

"Ou du guds lam som bar
All verdens synder"

I am possessed!!
The lack of faith is your,
Followers of the parasite god.
Eternal death and suffering
We embrace the knowledge
Of Satan!!!

Defending the throne of evil
The black frame burns
I am the voice of evil
I am possessed
Possessed!!!

3. Bloody Fucking Nekro Hell

Maximum evil power
Blood-smeared face of death
Cold mega engines of
Madness and hell!!!

The fury of a thousand deaths
Bloody fucking nekro hell
Blood-fuelled machinery
Conqueror of god
Bloody fucking nekro hell

Satanic poison death
Lungs filled up with vomit
You crawl knee-deep in shit
And gore
The engines is crushing more
And more.

I am the hell-commander of sin
Maximum evil satanic power
Bloody fucking nekro hell

4. Bloodlust And Perversion

Freezing rain pours down from
The clouds
Roar of a distant thunder
Awakes my thoughts
As we ride towards the
End of our fate

Our horse are carrying us
Through the winterland
Dark Medieval War!!

The mild breeze are getting
Stronger
My hands grabs the frosty
Sword
Through the vast winter
Landscape

As we enter the kingdom
Of the unknown
With hate, death and pain
Deceitful eyes!!!

War of chaos and thundering
Rage
Our hands are open to welcome
Their death

As our sharpened weapons
Collide
Into the battle we ride!!!

After the anger the silence
Began
And now, the cold night
Approaches
From the top of the winter

Mountain
To ride with glory and
Armageddish anger
With hate


5. Possibilities Of Life's Destruction

Can you hear the sound of an enormous door slamming in the depths of Hell?
The possibility of Life's destruction
Can you hear the cries of pain, the mournful sound?
The possibility of life's destruction

Can you hear the sound of an enormous door slamming in the depths of Hell?
The possibility of Life's destruction


6. In The Shadows Of The Horns

Face of the Goat in the Mirror
Eyes Burn like (an) October Sunrise
As Once they Gazed upon the Hillside
Searching for the Memories...

In the Shadow of the Horns
Only seen by the Kings
Of the Dawn (of the) First Millennium
Upon the Thrones

In the Shadow of the Horns
Cleansed like the air in the Night
World Without End

(we've become) a Race of the Cursed Seeds
For five United Forces
In the Eternal Dawn
The Kings that held (their) heads high

The Triumph of chaos - Has Guided our Path
We Circles the holy Sinai - Our Swords Gave Wings
Invisible force of our Abyssic Hate
Our seeds Boil as we gaze upon the New Millennium

Weeping by the Graves of the Glorious Ones
(so) the hardened Frost Melts Away
Clouds Gather across a Freezing Moon
I kiss the Goat - Witchcraft Still Breathes

7. In League With Satan

I'm in league with Satan
I was raised in hell
I walk the streets of Salem
Amongst the living dead
I need no one to tell me
What's wrong or right
I drink the blood of children
Stalk my prey at night

Look out beware
When the full moon's high bright
In every way I'm there
In every shadow in the night
I'm evil in league with Satan
Evil in league with Satan

I'm in league with Satan
Obey his commands
With the goat of Mendes
Sitting at his left hand
I'm in league with Satan
I love the dead
No one prayed for Sodom
As the people fled

I'm in league with Satan
I am the masters own
I drink the juice of women
As they lie alone
I'm in league with Satan
I bear the devils mark
I kill the new born baby
Tear the infants flesh

1. It's Darker Than You Think

My cold goddess of the night
Squirming under my spiked fist
She's giving me all carnal delights
Submit yourself and drink my blood

I am the bringer of hate
Evil reigns supreme on earth
Defenders of the blackest faith
Which strengthen my inner glow
Mind expanding inner journey
From a grim and bitter soul
Misanthropic violent hellblast
It's darker than you think...

For seemingly endless time
There is still blood on the old oak
This is where you come to die
Over three hundred years old
And still stretching towards the sky
The hangman's oak...

Burning, bleeding, dying
From the inside
Hitting, whipping, kicking
Tthe corpse of christ!!!
Reading, learning, seeing
All knowledge of evil
Watching, waiting, observing
My fallen angel...

I am the mortal guide
With spiritual possessions
I have seen the other side
And I have sold my soul!!!

I have no earthly tombstone
And I have no christian grave
I am a misanthrope
I am not a fucking slave!!!

3. The Well Of All Tears

Evil surrounds you, channelling hell
Through the seal...
The only answer lies within
Beholder of all sorrow
The root of damnation, eternal dedication

The night closes in
Dark and cold
Life is an abyss
Profound as a thousand nights

Through the seal of the dark
A journey through the bleakest mist
Evil surrounds you
The presence of death

The gates to madness
Channelling hell
The only answer lies within

Over the ice-cold fjords
Under the wind-swept mountains
The deepest of all forests
Where darkness lies unknown
A layrinth of trees
Grown on the most unholy soil

Forever in darkness
I have touched the hands of death
Beholder of all sorrows
And the well of all human tears
The root of damnation
Suck the marrow of the fucking bone
Eternal dedication
We, brotherhood of the blood

Beholder of all sorrows
And the well of all human tears


4. Put To Sleep Like A Sick Animal

Centuries have strengthened his soul
He knows the winds
He knows the woods and the trees
Firmly held by the strongest chains

He's waiting for the nightfall
He lurks in the evening mist
An earthly demon-made soul
Declaring destruction of god
Destruction and war
Hhe lurks the travellers to their death
He put a nail in your coffin
Forever and ever till the end of time
And he will always be
On top of the world!!!

Our lifeless faces of death
You will walk the darkest path
And find no inner peace
The blackest light of true evil

Torture me with a thousand razors
Torment me no further, kill me now
This is the day of suffering
This is the day I see you die

Get me out of this fucking hellhole
I can't stand the fucking smell
I can't stand your hypocrisy
You're going to hell

Living in fear, your death is tailor-made
Drowned in a pool of snot, tears and misery
You haven't seen the light
The christians were wrong!!!

There is no comfort in dying
There is no peace in death
You are worth nothing
Put to sleep like a sick animal

Put to sleep like a sick animal

6. Ancient Spirit Of The Underworld

Overhead the thunder cracked and roared
And when it ceased the deathlike silence
Chilled my marrow and bones
The need to feel dead was killing him

Like death itself
Evil is found in the earliest
Oldest and the most dreadful
Memories of humanity
Eternally feared by gods primitive men

Pale visions, death-pale they were all
Still cursed, haunted and alone
Killing woman, children and men
Sparing neither age nor sex

A place where reality is worthless
And all you want is to be left alone
They grind the land like corn
Showing no mercy
Spilling the blood like rain
Devouring their flesh and sucking
Dry their veins...

The undead leaves their graves
In misty transformations
You see half-visible bodies
Floating through the night
The ancient spirits of the underworld

[Repeat verse 1]

All the trees were lifeless and dead
And there were no birds singing
The reign of man is over
Drained for all its powers

He saw their starving lips shake
With a horrid grin gaped wide
And the corpse lies on the cold hill side
His spirit is carried away
By the northwinds into eternity


7. Spill The Blood Of The Lamb

I walk the path of death
Which no one will return
I will lead you to this path
And see you burn
The only guiding light
The blackest light
To you who seek the knowledge
I will spill your fucking blood!!!

Follow me through this earthly hell
And lay thy hands on his horned skull
And worship!!!
The fallen angel of doom

Faster, faster
We're heading towards total disaster
My father is fire my mother is hate
Nourished with the blood
That blackened my hellish faith

Poisoned by the christian earth
Baptized by priest at birth
I command and follow lucifer
As the only representative
Living force... Lucifer!!!

The blackest light of evil
I have the knowledge
Spilling my blood!!!

I fell first amongst the angels
Who despise jesus christ
And all other heavenly creatures
Of the so-called heaven
The age of the moon
That should be observed by
All of the true heathen blood
I expect no less!!!
Spill the blood of the fucking lamb!!!


8. One With The Earth

A shiver creeps down my spine
As I wander through these hordes
And when these callous arm
Streches out for me, I feel at home

You are the beholders of silence
Still your voice of wisdom means more to me
Than the words from a thousand men ever will

In a time with religious whores
Which keeps fucking the same cock
I gasp for air, you are my shelter

A forthcoming winter-night
From one of your mighty arms
I will hang in a rope
I am you, and you are the earth!!!

Your presence is indispensable
For the existence of life
Your elegy in stormy nights
One with the earth
And one with death!!!


9. Christian Incoherent Drivel

As the decades and centuries rolled by
Most of the christians no longer thought
That the second coming of christ
Would take place in their own lifetime

They firmly believed
The awaited return of jesus christ
To earth in order to judge
The living and the dead

But they thought its possible
That these holy events
Might not come to pass
For hundreds or thousands of years

On the basis of a complex numerical
Calculations involving the symbolic
Interpretation of the so called
Book of truth

Still the preachers of our modern age
Which prophecies claimed true
Admit and coness your pathetic sin
Then you kneel and let the brainwash begin

The world will be swept by war and plagues
All evil will control humanity
Many will follow the beast 666
And take up arms against christ
The battle of armageddon is near

Apocalypse pestilence war famine and death
The demons of finality
From the sky they came
As written in biblical times
The vision of the destruction fo earth
The future is dark and violent
Carpathian Forest wants you dead, DEAD!


10. The Old House On The Hill

He lives in a old house on the hill
This elderly man of dark secrets
Haunted by the memories decades ago
Which shaped this man throughout his life
The old house on the hill
A call from hell
Far from people, he lives in the past
Alone by himself, always alone to the last
A saw, a drill and hammering on nails
The curtain covers the dusty windows
Scratching sounds and the sound of knives
Being sharpened from time to time

The old house on the hill
The old house on the hill


11. Necrophiliac, Anthropophagus Maniac

The nekrophiliac mental disorder
Cadaverous sexual deviations
An uncontrollable strong desire
Reading obsessively all obituaries
Dig up the recently deceased woman
And break into their tombs
Of the freshly buried sluts
And fuck them before they rot!!!

Dissecting the stiff and dead
Eating the eyeballs and the inside
Of her opened head
The infliction includes no pain
But the destruction of her
Innards and brain

Consuming the pieces of the corpse
Of someone who has been
Mutilated beyond recognition
A necrosadistical uncontrollable lust
There is much blood on the floor
Pus, entrails and stinking gore
Necrophiliac anthropophagus maniac

He needs to see her inside out
Necrphiliac

God-made sickening art
Ffrom her dismembered skill and head
Necrophiliac


12. Cold Murderous Music

Why don't you kill yourself
Slit, your wrists
Slit the right one
Now the left.

As a symbol for our end.
Hang yourself in the stairs.

Throw yourself in front of
An eighteen wheel semi truck.

Try to stick your pencils, up your nose
And smashing it into a table

Take a shotgun
And blow out your brain.
You're not using it anyway.

People Don't Care.
This is how life goes.

Take a heroin overdose
Your death is your extasy
And it beats lusting for me.

Why don't you kill yourself
Slit your wrists.

Hang yourself in the stairs.

Throw yourself in front of
An eighteen wheel semi truck.

Try to stick your pencils, up your nose
And smashing it into a table

Take a shotgun
And blow out your brains
You're not using it anyway

People. Don't. Care.
This is, how life goes.

Take a heroin overdose.

2. The Frostbitten Woodlands Of Norway

From the ice-cold Norwegian Hills
From the silver mountain
And from My world I consider you Dead
I am born of Evil and Sin
And I always walked unholy paths
That you never seen or heard of
...And I must fight the endless battle ALONE

You Freeze to death.. In morning mist..

The direction of cold winds brings the putrid smell of Death...
All Heretics and Devils stand up and rides towards the Unholy Death...

Inhuman Coldness, Hellish winds
Black demons of the past
Norwegian Winter Hell...
Violent Battlecries, Perverted deathnoise
Victorious echoes of War, Death and Despair...
Candle life of own blood, and Heathen Heritage..


3. Start Up The Incinerator (Here Comes Another Useless Fool)

Start it up
Start it up!!!

I got a desperate urge to slaughter
I have a sickening need to torture
I can die by no human hands
This unholy demon force

I was born to line the tombs of men
I am born of Satan and of sin
Black as a sculpture
Full winged on every cold night
Everyday I eat the fucking apple of Eden
Awaiting the destruction of the gods

I command you all to go out and slaughter
I command you fools to rape and murder
All for the glory of Him!
All for the glory of Hell!

Start up the incinerator
Here comes another useless fool

Thrash!!!
Who the fuck do you think you are?

Start up the incinerator
Here comes another useless fool

You must always live in sin
You must never help the weak
You must never feel guilt
And you live in the sorrow
And you live in the pain
And who the fuck do you think you are?
Start up the incinerator!

4. Submit To Satan!!!

I embrace the cold Death..
With the burning Blade of Evil
The warm Blood on my hands
THE PENTAGRAM!!!!!
The trembling in your Christian knees
Liar, Weak is the Nature of Man..
What the hell are you waiting for????
Submit to SATAN!!
Cut the flesh (and) submit to Death!!
Whip and burn your skin
The Hellfire will burn deep within
Come Sodomy, Satan and Sin...

My blood is eternally yours
I will give my life to you!!!
Everyday I must SUFFER
FUCK OFF and let me bleed...
"..I laugh and spit at your mortality
Because I know there is NO heaven.."
As Violent Hellstorm returns
The cold Winds of Madness from the Dark human Abyss
Kill all meaningless Icons..

Step forth to the Devils Warfield
And see His world through possessed Satanic eyes...

And the purest fire burns within..
A hunger for Death!!!
The world Abyss!!!!!!

9. Evil Egocentrical Existencialism

I vomit on your compassion
Cause there is no salvation
This is maximum fucking hell
I cant fucking breath
I used to live a long life

Maximum fucking hell

A burn and destructive carnival
I vomit on your compassion
Jesus Christ come
Total evil, total hell

Understandable I feel the cold I feel the hatred
In the vast glorious nothingness I call human heaven

Mercy on me...

10. Shut Up, There's No Excuse To Live

Come chaos, come death
Like a wolf, he is the hunter
Like an owl, belongs to the night
Like a serpent, his bite is deadly
Like a cunt, waiting to be fucked

waiting to be fucked
like a cunt waiting to be fucked

Like a blade, it makes you bleed
Like a bullet, it's meant to kill.
Like a war, he is majestic
Like a metal, I will stand, stand supreme.
I stand supreme!
Like a metal I stand supreme.

1. Promeathea - Thy Darkest Mask Of Surreality

"The darkest clouds are forming,
Remove my mask of serenity from my tortured face,
We are as one desire,
Beneath the infinity of the majestic sky,
Arise my darkest entity,
From the domain which I dwell,
Our time has come,
This is our kingdom,
We are the essence of warm winters."

2. The Crimson Thorns (My Immortal Dreams)

3. A Graven Winter

Through the Darkening Tranquility,
the Entwining of Twin Passion in Deepest Love,
of one Vision of the Immortal Graveyard.
Centuries of Sleep on a Journey to my Rapture,
as I gaze up through Spellbinding Branches the Deepest Snow
falls thick Scorching into my Heart.
The most Supreme Vision of all, for the Sharpening of Deepest Midnight
in the Essence of Perpetual Winter... is my Journey complete?
The Breeding of Witchcraft shall Consume the Night, to Unite as One -

A Living Immortal Monument...

5. An Ode For A Haunted Wood

6. Through Spellbinding Branches

7. The Danse Macabre

8. Luciferian Death Code

I hear my angel weeping silently amidst the graves
A glorious yet mournful veil, yet in whose name is she slain
Behind the truth the strength conceals twisted faith of Christian fools
The memoirs rekindled daylights last foray

Rekindled daylights last foray

A delicate balancing of two worlds
Embraced with the guardian death
The crest of our years somewhat fainted
Esteris, thy lingered opeth
Where two shores lay overlapped and time lay inter bracing
Many folds revealing facets, each for futures passing

The enochians of timeless earth
For thee, in sinful obscurity
Brought forth thy pleasures and languidity
I rise in amidst thy fear
To collate the precious faith and penultimate tear
To weave, thy starry ultimus
Set in gentle precious flame, nor to awaken us
Lemuria, at the edge of the graveyard
A lurid pale of seeking as she haunts in despair
I serve as the angel of death
Slept in dusk of the gravestones, in castles despair
Take grave solace in thy wisdom told
For the centinal alone could only be so bold
Innocence succumb to grieving majesty
Light auroral incarnations of sobriety.

2. Beneath A December Twilight

From the darkest kaos from beyond this time
I shall free my wings as our souls align
Mortal barriers are falling in crippling time
In the moonlighting darkness, the garden divine

For invoking the dark, and the blood of its Lord
It shall punish the weak with its bestial sword
The innocent blood sacrificed in the night
Within darkness comes rapture in beautiful sight

Feel the midnight's pull
The answers to darkness and dreams in full
For only as eternity unfolds
Lie the secrets within a funeral toll

Slain by the hand too close to see
Prism in their eyes for eternity
Blessedly fading for all to see
Painting a picture of hypocrisy

Fraying at the edges of sanity
Beneath its surface a part of me
Unleash the tyrant from within
For no face can see beneath this opaque mask of deadened time
Image that emerges through the wrath and pain combined
Silken dreams of Avalon where shadows dwell for all time

As a demon I roar
Within the fabric of thoughts
My purpose an anchor
And exhale my spirit into the night air
Stained as I fall beneath my shroud
And my flesh anointing tribute to the proud
In a breath from an everless nightfall enshadowed thee
Fore I am forever as eternity chants its chivalry
As a silhouette in the night
Not of this world of within sunlight
Fore only as eternity unfolds
Lie the secret within a funeral toll


3. The Spell Of The Winter Forest

in the darkenss
i awaken
as once again
beneath the cover of the night sky
we indulge
in aliance of sathanas
the infinity
pounding at dawn
where shadows fear tread
as dark envokes me
i vow to thee
for my enemies shalt suffer
for we are the brave
i have eternity
in which we shalt dwell
dying ****"

deep in the forest...

deep in the spell...

drink deep in the promise of the midnight

To dream of secrets, and desires in witch craft

Immortal, Salvation, I bleed the sky, for he rythes upon the cross, bleeding the Jewish lies

6. The Slaughter Of Innocence, A Requiem For The Mighty

From the darkest kaos from beyond this time
I shall free my wings as our souls align
Mortal barriers are falling in crippling time
In the moonlighting darkness, the garden divine
For invoking the dark, and the blood of its Lord
It shall punish the weak with its bestial sword
The innocent blood sacrificed in the night
Within darkness comes rapture in beautiful sight

7. At The Haunted Gallows Of Dawn

8. Christfire

9. Within The Ruins Of Eden

Fire of light, the ancients of dark night
Transcending through the war of passions delight
Feeding on the screams, a prelude to eternity's sigh
Shading like the trees, the gods are on their knees
How thouest darkness fills my dreams
I cannot forget the touch of winters breath
With infinity trapped in a sickening vale
Safe in their dark catatombs darkness unveiled
But a silhouette simply just like a shadow
Is shading the monument longing to overthrow
Ruins of Eden, savage of the demon
And shall spread his wings of eternity
Ripping forth through heaven and unto my dark angel
The fortress of this flesh is lonely and possessed
To a place where time and space are death
On a stagnant pool against the shores of Valhalla
In the presence of the shadows of Knell
They shall suffer in the fires of hell
Dark stagik forces and channelling fire
Fore here I am to walk in the garden of desires
Diabolus is rising forth to awaken the undead
Beyond the graves of shadows raging forth where angels fear to tread
Merely in an eye, of unholy sacrifice
Imprisoned for eternity
Lighting up the sky, the infant born to die
In darkening serenity
I am the dark living part of eternity veiled in the darkness
Breathing the chants hereafter
For deep in the woods I shall dwell in the stream of my languid creator
Dancing with fire in the moonlight
Dancing with fire in the moonlight
SATANAS

10. The Danse Macabre

Within the bells of eternity chiming, darkness takes us still
We partake now each others indulgence, according to our will

The tears are the same as they struggle to blame
Congregation shall be burnt to the ground
For the fictions of insanity are holiest hypocrisy
Suffocating now without a sound

I hear you now from a thousand voids
Removed from time and timelessness
Where incarnations of simple nouns
Are beings each with golden crowns
Out beneath the open night
A wanderer lies weeping
In some unspoken sadness
While her dream is oversleeping
Her dreams ablazed with accursed fire
Of regret and eternal vigils
Hallowing nights, temptations lust
Compiled of satanic sigils

Death will come as sudden
By the magik of our Coven
The ultimate horror is told
I stand alone and solemn
In the presence of Amon
I am sacrifice slowly going cold

Dreams ablazed with accursed fire
Of regret and eternal vigils
Hallowing nights, temptations lust
Compiled of satanic sigils

Out beneath the open night
A wanderer lies weeping
In some unspoken sadness
While her dream is oversleeping

Demand the dreams macabre
The danse macabre

11. The Reckoning (An Eternity Of Darkness)

2. The Pagan Swords Of Legend

Slaying souls, danse macabre
From within and still unscarred
I stand alone and solemn as thy distant lights frey to death
And all around fore none as demon shall be found
Out beneath the azrael
Tolling raven of the knell

And to my dark angel

Whose form too vast to comprehend
As demons rise and re-ascend
Here is were evenings serenades
Amidst the dawn as gracious slaves

For my words are without sound
Far beyond and well renown
Centuries of dusk in time
Bleeding shadows of thy shrine
Within, thy darkness frey born of kaos in decay
Reaping shadows unto thee
A gracious death for all to see
As infinite avails
The human race that never fails
Played upon thy calming heart
Eyes of terror bleeding hard
That I doth control thee
Leading southward to the key
Hanging from the brances frail
Queen of darkness to unveil

Where whispers charm thy emptiness
And pierce thy tenous membrane
That striketh through my anguished heart
And tainted skys, where once demons remained
As the silent darkness breeding
Winters hate in silouettic sky
Stained with blood of an ancient slumber
With such a passionate melancholy

Of ages past and times to come
Shall speak in sound and slay in tongues
And spirits chanting satans hail
As darkness falls unto thy veil

Between in death thy black spirit
From thy pain we shall commit
Sleeping shadows demons fray
From beyond in massacre's pain
Fore thou art draped in sin
Amidst the shadows I have been
And seek the silent sentinel
On battlefields where they fell

Desire rekindles thee
Nearer than infinite
The dying scent of fragrant death
Fore spell of winter I possess
That I might dream thy pain
Invoke to tee like dragons slain
A lullaby like song of grave
Caressing shadows, demons slave

Thou alone soth se me in this sorrow

Fore thou art beautiful, fore thou art bright
Flashing thy splendour amidst the midnight
Thou canst not flee, mine shalt thou be
Of all enchantment
Thou shalt a goddess be

3. Centuries Of Wolven Hunger

Give me the art of cheating and deceiving of thy dreams
May each and all become the death of ancient winter screams

Thus on her knees shall bequeath
The cold, cold moon writhes under
What thou desirest thou shalt obtain
As the war begins, Jehovah be slain

Darkness seeps upon abyss
Shall victimise the serpents kiss
Feast and drain thy goblet deep
A silence torn unto defeat

I wait for thee of killing spree
The soul and pain both unredeemed
As silence burns in witching hour
As thou wilt seek to hear them scream

Since thou hath made thy offering
The truth be known of evening spring
Who the chase by night preferest thee
Misfortuned deemed uncertainty

Thou who wakest in starry slumber
Of the stars and of the moon
The wolven screams of thy desire
Of the horn thyself the huntress
Huntress of the night forseen
Of cloaking blackness too obscene
Although our sight
The dance in flames for thy slumber


4. Forever In Ebony Drowning

The bestial sunset black at dawn
As I embrace thee
The dark god and I will keep thee safe
Scream to us in terror
Fore darkness is the essence of revenge and all mortality
I am the ending before life begins again

Ritualised as darkness falls to call the unbeleivers
Satan majesty of night shall punish its deceivers
Thou art immortal reign of terror and seductive pain

From the darkness
The moon dwelleth I
And all kaos rise
Incantation breathe
Consecration be

The seasons are as one derived
I pour my soul as nocturnal wine

Who wouldst break thy hallowing point, as darkness neverending of mist
between, we shall be seen, and thus evil descending

The seasons are as one derived
Of kaos and eternal shrines

From ashes of their ruined eden
Cloaked and veiled we follow demon
Thou art aged in tribulation
Silent, dark, forbidding one

Of every aeon of lore within
Bleak with the shadows and captured in sin
As one or the other is ending this way
To bring shame on the fools who have nothing to say

Deep in the shadows I learned how to curse
Fore the ending is nearer than that of the earth
The lenght of their suffering prolonged in time
As dreaming of winter becomes a new shrine

Forgotten, forlorn in ebony I drown
As king of the night and darkness I'm crowned
In chapters of kaos and magik within
Shall repent all my sorrow and indulge in sin

The seaons are as one derived
As kaos falls and eternal shrines

Who wouldst break thy hallowing point as darkness neverending
Of mist between, we shall be seen, and thus evil descending, thou art
immortal reign of terror and seductive pain


5. Upon The Kingdom Throne

Interlaced within your rapture
Wrapped in twighlight from hereafter
So that you might know the flavour of that desire
Destiny through dreams of sorrow
All life ends weak and hollow
And cannot know your tears of light shall remain

"The skys alone told tales of fire
Conspiracy of pain and desire
Raping heavens to the thunders roar"

Oh, dost thou
Dost thou taste the languid sweetness of my love
For revenge of fire on heaven
Of what has been left within
And the chaptered pain of horror
Deeply sighs and spreads her wings
You shall hear me with your ears
That are deaf to spoken tongues
Enchanting all forsaken
Voices poisoning their lungs
And to be spoken forever
In webs of enshadowed destiny
They do not penetrate the conscious mind
Reflecting sanity

Drawing all life and light into them
Leaveth thou in their turmoil draining again
The sound of emotion, thy thunderous heart
And tethered forever in your thoughts from afar

Beneath the veil of tears they wear
They see not clear enough to care
Darkness seething avalon, fore skys reap death and heavens tear
And speak in tongue of secrets told
Of spirits kindred, bought and sold
A kingdom beneath a veil of dark shalt remain
Your velvet skin in breath of sorrow

A token of thy graveless honour
Fore thou art the touch of death like winters sigh
And to remain in this forever
Draped in darkness here together
So many dreams but never sleeping
Anguished pain, eternal weeping


6. For Thee, In Sinful Obscurity

7. Dark Requiems And Unsilent Massacre

Thy souls in flames of anger, and cruelty cradle thee
In times of war and dragons lore, unleashing unto me

Deepest red born winter, for none so dark as thou
With kaos as its figurines, and monuments of stone
Invoke to thee, dark majesty silence told in darkness breathe
Shall soak with blood in secrets told through forests dusk of putrid dreams

Stained with blood our seal shall be alive
Suffering, indulged in sin as flesh and fire are one within
Raping heavens to the thunders roar

Bring forth the circle and the skys we shall command
And deathly haunting avalon forever in this land
With hate embracing vengeance of power on thy seal
Shall blessedly affect their death, enchanting all surreal

Blackening kaos ripping through my soul

"Beneath souls of infinite light, as darkness falls upon all
As invocations of terror and destruction
Condemn and deny those of feeble weakness"

Upon the altar
Darkness destroy thou
We are of winter
Release seals of death

All about this ruined tomb, fragment silence of forever
Dreaming ancient winters in the moonlight
SIlence of forever drowning
And fall, embrace me to the sun

And failed to wake, to be then forsaken
As gardens die and heavens shake
We are the silence of forever burning bright

Darkness, crawls in all eternity
As fear be their martyr
Draped in darkest ebony
Upon the altar darkness reaches through my soul
Enchanting in the garden be thy kingdom on the throne

Dark satanic majesty, give unto me the seal of the damned
So that I may conjure thee, as infinity burns
The reflections of deepest emotion burning within
Death and all avalon awaiting, as blackness surrounding,
Immortality prevail in emotion... in emotion...
Anoo nomine satanas nightfall...

In the name of the dark one

8. Thy Sorrow Bequeathed

And wash away this sweet despair
I give all that I am to you
For reasons they cannot quite discern
Somewhere deep within the night

Darkness chimes in justice
Reasons for armistace
Unaware, between thy values of grace
Freedom yet inferno
Spiting all incarnal
Ever so silent the graveridden kiss

Breaking in mercy, shall fall to thy knees
As kaos damnation, spreading its wings
Through winds of salvation our sorrow doth share
And armed with the seals of blackness we wear

Woven silken darkness from thy dreams

Lo' the ancient queen
Thy paleness still bequeathed
And shadowing thy nest of dawn
Beneath the throne we shall redeemed
We shall redeem our nature

In shadows that I cast is yours
Of spinning visions of other shores
Fore art reflecting deeming night
And shall reside in candlelight

Alive, come forth, thou art in yearning
Irrevocably their worth

And certain guardians of the gates
I am the living part of death
And so beyond understanding of thee
Unleashing darkness gripped in light with fury

Wrapped in purpose yet with everything to see
Darkness bestowed unto thee
And shall declare thy living breath
For none so certain to cheat death


9. The Scarlet Forsaken

As the scarlet and amber, peers in through forsaken
Thy gravelessness whisper remains
Where time can never dwell in this solitary hell
Even though we are free of its chains

For I am not as once I was
I yearn to search and watch return
Meeting shadows, seasons tare
As once they roamed without a care
The blood and wine, for art divine
All mist in seething, never sleeping

As I wait in thy rapture, the sound of our laughter
Sword in my hand I shall arise
For darkness in waiting, prevail and forsaking
Enshadowing evil divine
From an evergreen land where the lore shall command
The patrons of right shall remain
And dwelleth forever int he lands of the nether
MEWN LLADDU I'R SAESON GAN DDWYLO CYMRU
Be found in trains of nightmare thy darkness remains
A precarious entity subjected to change
A yearning expressed sprung through tales of death
As infinity unites, with kaos we remain

For centuries of dark shall crack open the moonlight sky
This mournful sound as darkness falls upon thy face
I cannot see beyond the haze that distorts thy shadow
'Neath of terrible slaves
And wouldst thou trade thy dying soul
For the life that burns
That a thousand lifetimes be hidden in frost
Held captive forever for the war they've lost
Draped in sinister pain, only terror remains
And the scarlet forsaken be hidden in shame


10. Ancient Graveless Dawn

To a place of ancient splendour
I returned to moments night
To catch the lightning in your eye
And tame it with a lullaby
Darkness falls upon thy face
All figments of the human race
It is as if I've always known
For none but them the overthrown

Deep in the shadows the prism is thine
And death lying waiting within horned god sign
The graves lying silently seeping their worth
As creatures, as warriors once roaming the earth

Destiny of ancient sorrows
Falls through shattered dreams
That pierces like a lightning bolt
Re-kindling thy darkest scream

Ancient, of dawn
For none so art like him, as I am darkness spawned
Releasing shadows as we fall, I am your empath
Slowly growing pale, capturing the dusk in sin
Darkness, breathes superior, swallowing the moonlight sky
As fate within thy destiny that came to life in one black night

Faith in all the keepers of our legend

Death intertwined and embracing all time
All figments eluded that practically shine
Have faith in your warriors, weak as their worth
And slain in amusing satanical curse

"And upon my word we shall unite
Heeding eternal blackness
For none so like him as us
As deepest storms roll
And falling rain on to thy face
Remember me as king upon the throne of pain"

And midnight of hunger ripping forth with hate
As vengeance chimes thy fate
Upon an altar, a song played upon the wind
As covens, indulged in sin

1. Miasma

2. Perjurer

Lie about the afterlife
Seeking people who are weak
Only your ideas are right
It's you who are the weak

3. Deceiving The Deceiver

Not nearly a close second
Your race eradicated
Transferred to the light of obscurity
Your soul wanders endlessly

4. Malignant Entity

5. Blessing In Disguise

Invoking blessings - through my prayers
Praising gods - evil spirits
For my blessings - in disguise
Kings of chaos - evils rise

6. I Am Born

Impurity running through my soul
Unholy blood running through my veins
An aura of darkness
Surrounding me
I am born - I'm eternity

7. Exalted In Depravity

8. Conquest Complete

From the darkness
We've destroyed thee
Our times here
Conquest complete

9. The Downfall

Blackest of angels come for me
Sin my soul for eternity
Give me the power to oversee
The fall of Christianity


10. Repent (See The Light)

Too afraid to change your ways
Worried about God's damnation
A religion full of flaws
Now you see it's Satan's cause

11. Witch Queen Ascending

1. So Called Savior

From such early days on
I always knew there was a difference
Unlike so many others
Their bigoted minds
Discriminated constantly
But we'll eventually see
What the future holds
I am ready to die

So called Savior
Watch my ascension
So called Savior
See my elation

The seeds were planted
During the formative years
But I saw the truth
I saw the lies for what they were
Its just a dying pity
You couldn't do the same
You irrelevant life
Has no meaning at all

So called Savior
See my elation
So called Savior
Watch my ascension

Now your falling
Now your falling

How your falling
How your falling

You stand silent
You stand silent

You keep silent
You keep silent

2. New Day Emerges

...and angels wither and die
Death raining from the sky
The sheep are now with warning
Miasma all around

Air thickens with fear
Death grows near
All blanketing me
All I see

The flock they are restless
They lead to the way
The way of the doomed
Leading them all astray
Into the miasma
One my one they'll slay
Destroying deceivers
Starting a new day

New day emerges
Dark new era
Dark new era
New day emerges
New day emerges

Feel the power
Feel the power

Dark new era
Dark new era
New day emerges
Dark new era
Dark new era
New day emerges
New day emerges

Aura filling all around
One by one without a sound
Beckoning towards their death
Holy flock one final breath

And it destroys all the deceivers and betrayers without mercy
The evil inside is the ultimate power
A new day emerges

The morning mist beckons
It calls out my name
The morning miasma
Leaving all slain
It raped all their virtues
It raped all their hopes
Destroyed all their dream
Destroyed all that false

3. Commence The Chaos

4. Designed With Hate

Behold after silent prayers
Changing the souls direction
By praising those of the dark
A new strength emerges
A strength designed with hate
Controlled to destroy all enemies
And now your time has come
Your futures non existent

And the voice says..
Do it - do it - do it - do it

Raging
Seething
Waiting
Should I?

Waiting
Seething
Raging

Before the dark paved the way
A darkened heart shaded grey
As time elapsed transformed jet black
Now's the time ready for attack

Ready for attack
Ready for attack

Feel the nails - tearing through flesh
Gasp for air - ribs collapsing
Wear the crown - unworthy holy
Feel the pain - all unholy

Your pain is my pleasure
You suffering is my delight

Wear the crown - unworthy holy
Feel the pain - all unholy

Thank you dark lords my soul I shall give
My strength from you, my will to live
My path is chosen I've seen the way
The hatred inside that wont go away
Thank you dark lords my soul I shall give
My strength from you, my will to live
My path is chosen I've seen the way
The hatred inside that wont go away


5. Silenced But For Their Cries (I Am Born Part II)

The clouds gather
The dark skies loom
The thunder claps
A life filled tomb

Life filled tomb

The earth that we once knew
Defunct, desolate in view
Disease and death abound
This era I am crowned

The mortals run in fear
Their lives soon disappear
Saved from a life of lies
Silenced but for their cries

But for their cries
But for their cries

Now I'm crowned
Now I'm crowned

Now I'm crowned
Now I'm crowned

Just as I saw, by his Majesty's law
Now I'm crowned
Now I'm crowned

Lifeless / extinct

6. Buried Alive

I'm alive but dead, awake but asleep
As friend gather round and mourners they weep
My mind thinks of all the things I have done
My body is cold but my heart beat goes on
And on...and on

As they lower me down into that hole in the ground
I scream out for help but they hear not a sound
I fear at the lid, my fingers they bleed
Is this happening to me or is it just a dream
Summon the dead.
Baphomets call.
Blood on my hands.

"Let me out of here"

My bones are decayed, my flesh it doth rot
I'm lying in silk, take the lid off this box
My lungs gasp for air, my eyes scream for sight
I promise the rise of my body this night
Summon the dead.
Baphomets call.
Blood on my hands.
Screaming in torment.
I'm felling you all.
Take heed of my plea.
Answer my call.
I'm gonna be free.

2. Soil Of Sin

I awaken
Apprehension and excitement engulf me
For today is the day
The expedition of indulgence
How long have I waited
My voyage to be the soil of sin
Knowing of delights untold
Thoughts are racing, mind reflecting
Time becomes non-existent
To the soil of sin I long to be
Where my black heart can now lie
Lost, lost, I struggle to find my way
Roaming the land I seek the unholy ground
Panic, panic, lost, lost
Lost in a place I know not of - Limbo
I see the light
Attracted I venture closer
Knowing of my earthly delights
Home is the soil of sin

3. Headhunter

Torn from the shadows drawn into my head
The powers I seek have been stolen from the dead
From being watched I take control
The temple of perversion shall be my home
I see them - the demons
That grimace just for me
The powers they bestow upon me I embrace
Watching over my sacred soul all my life
Saved by the evil that controls all my life
Perversity - blasphemy - atrocity - humanity
Sacrifice human life
Slaying all in my sight
Now as I see I can be what I am
Blasphemy in my eyes, blasphemy in my life
Now as I see I can be what I am
Angels cry, demons rise for my soul
Take control

4. No One Hears

Night draws near - I appear
For his life you now fear
Cloaked by the dark, taking form - hidden
In the shadows I do dwell - hidden
As the holy son rests peacefully
Totally unaware of my being
His life now in my hands
His life is worthless
The time to alter the future is almost upon me
Altering
Now you die - how you cry
Worthless life now destroyed
Day appears - no more fears
Nazarene - no one hears

5. The Face Of Betrayal

As you hang upon the cross
The lies are already there
More of an unholy cult
The face of betrayal
No real truths, just more lies
Millions sucked in
How could a man of love let this happen?
How could a man of love be this deceitful?
How could a man of love not giveth?
And how could a man of love taketh away?
You are not my lord - pathetic illusion
Preaching self-deceit, not a fiber of truth
I see your face - I vision the true evil
I see a waste of what life is
Fuck you Jesus Christ
You are no lord of mine

6. As Fire

Lies,
In the end you can't disguise
What awaits you all and I
The truth is before your eyes
The gates open wide
Sinners, lost souls, bastards, join us now
Why?
Lead on by your faith, you're blind
The secrets you've kept will blind
You with the horde riding high
Your fate lies with me
Stand tall
Slaughter, kill them all, blood on my hands
Have no fear, as your death is nigh
The waves of hate reigning down
Man's wrath, as old as time
Relish in blood of me
No more Christian, no more Muslim
Kill religion - Judaism
Kill the mother and the father
Kill the priest - holy man
If you believe, that we are all sinners and going to hell
As fire, raging, burning, hate runs through me
Release thy demons

7. The Shining Delight

Years of holdbacks, years of strife
Some wasted time, some wasted life
A look to the future for all positive thoughts
The past is exactly that
Right here - right now
A coiled spring
Against the odds, against the grain
Like the worm, halved but alive
Immortal thoughts
We are here to stay
Now and forever
The truth is revealed, encased for all to see
The shining delight
A monument to longevity


8. An Eternal Belief (I Am Born Part III)

See them run from this place
Through the dark, no escape
I am here, and I rule now
Lives are perished, life is cherished
Beautiful sights
I am here and I rule now
Join me my brothers in my dark ways
The future is bright and gone are the gray days
The last of the sheep are finally hunted
No more remaining and no more wanted
The earth now finally cleansed of the scum
No more the weak, the afraid and the dumb
The planet of Satan my work now done
The cross is inverted, believe holy son
The earth now finally as it should be
No more the reign of hypocrisy
The planet of Satan now rebuilt by me
The cross is inverted - eternally
You cannot deny an eternal belief

9. Morbeea

10. Redimus

Within my mist filled eyes, utopia lies
Look through my vacant stare
I yearn to wonder there
I shall now rise above you all
Passion inside to destroy
Yet through these years I have stayed (too long?)
I hate today again
You won't break me
Through these eyes, I won't cry
With these hands, I must fight
All I'll give is the hurt that you gave to me
It's but only time
Hold unto me what's mine
Fuck you and your kind - evermore
It is coming
Your venom won't stop us
Our onslaught relentless
They have tried, they won't win
The passion is too deep
Redimus - We return

11. Choose Misanthropy

The mind war rages
Truthful thoughts deemed inappropriate
Silence is golden
The path to a peaceful world
The way of the weak
Incompetence is all I see
As much use as your dead god
It's no wonder I fucking hate
Like a cyst you grow, soon to be cut off
Cut off from your mortal coil
I understand how the mind war rages
I choose misanthropy - this is my name
I choose misanthropy - this is my peace
Without solitude a real war would rage
However mortal laws in power
The beast must be tamed for now
But soon enough I will unleash my grand finale
My visions of what soon shall be are dark and sinister
My visions of what soon shall be are devastating in effect


12. Overriding Imagination

Perishing, withering
Mind unable to comprehend
A temporary state or euphoria
Brought on by all the mentally wrong
The last brick in the window
All light is shunned
A new consciousness now born
One of warm content
Grinning with glee, all that I see
No pain, no misery
Pathways exposed, mind explored
For what cost?
Sanity escaped
Brain malfunction
Overriding imagination
Nothing is right, all is wrong
I feel like hell itself
For every good deed there is an evil
Will I remember tomorrow?
Or is this another life?
The invaders come for me
Foretold in revelations
Untruly lost for words
And caught somewhere in time
The prophecy that I have seen
Is the silent assassin
Brain malfunction

1. Thrones Of Shadow

Screams of the goddess
Echo through me, my soul torn
Unending, deathless
The memory of illusionary thorns

Awakening beneath the cursed ground
Rising through the depths of lifeless stone
Ancient cruelty, forgotten beauty
Intertwined through satanic litany

Monarchs of destructions
Shall blot out the barren stars
Reigning for untold aeons
Upon thrones of shadow

A new age dawns above
The blackened earth
The weak shall tremble
All shall fall before our wrath

Death to the tribes of Judah
I shall exalt in their demise

Awakening beneath the cursed ground
Final voice of prophecy
Ancient cruelty, forgotten beauty
Resurrected eternally
I shall fear no enemy
Before your malign faces three
Dark mother of witchcraft
At the crossroads shall we meet


2. Unchained

Blind to the wisdom that hides within
The face of the baleful azure sky
Mysteries bound beyond counting
Within infernal sanctuaries

I reach out to grasp the shackles and
tear them from my withered skin

Awake now from this slavery
Taste of this infinity
To destroy the bloody chains
To deny the pillars of being

Primordial chaos incarnate
I wander through the heavens' vastness
All before me shall I lay waste
Unto the end of all

All before me shall I lay waste

As I apporach the heavens' gate,
slaked in the blood of christ,
I embrace this damnation,
flood my body with divine scorn

Paths wrought from the skin of angels
Alone shall I walk
Through the empyrean
And so I descend to
The silent watchers
Beyond the gates of dawn


3. Abyssal March

A sickness is breeding here
Within the soils of this world
Creation reduced to tarnished silver,
Accumulation's hollow child
Following greed sullied parables
They build on works of corruption
Raising the towers of Babel
On the backs of mindless men

Cleansing flame shall descend
The burning tongues of Phlegethon
In the name of our dark lord
Shall their blood feed the river's flow

Staring into their eyes
Nothing but emptiness
My blade shall be answer
As it falls through their flesh

Your gold and silver is tainted
And their rust shall bear witness
Your lives and deeds wasted
And your legacy is dust
The blood of billions stains the earth
None shall escape the fires
Of the infernal goddess' kiss
Humanity scattered,
they march into the abyss


4. Plagued By Black Death

Auguries of disease have
finally come to pass over this world
In clouds rampant pestilerous death
raining down from the skies
Crowds gasping for air as
the abhorrence takes hold
I am as one with the pestilence,
bestowing this final gift

Sewing contagion amongst
the helpless flock
Mercilessly I am scourge
to man and beast alike
Their feeble shepherd writhes,
his skin blistered and cold
I am the death of God,
plageous black salvation

The earth I defile
Extinction of the human race
Satan's will unfurled

Plagued by black death

Poison seeps through the veil,
the absence between the worlds
Plunging doomed the
lands into eternal night
Power unrivalled,
anticosmic darkness unbridled
Purification through all
pervading nightfall's vines

Plagued by black death

As the seraphim cease their song
With the heavens collapsing around them
Behold, the emptiness of the lightless sky
Behold, the majesty of pestilential death

Behold the emptiness of the lightless sky
A vast unmoving expanse
Behold the majesty of pestilential death
And the contamination of all life

5. Euphoria

As the visions burn...
As my skin turns cold...
I clench my bloodied fist
And the knife carves my wrist

Wracking my body
In ecstasy
Liberation in extremis

Reflected in mirrors
Despair's divine image

Crystal tained
Crimson flows
Liberation in extremis

Lost in the grip of euphoria
As my life's blood is shed
As the knife
Tastes flesh
Exalted broken wretch

Lost in the grip of euphoria
As my life's blood is shed

My will turned to hate
My malice turned to bliss
Nausea flooding my senses as
My wounds quiver and beg for more

'Ere the sun rises
I will breathe no more

Suicide sacrifice
Abhorred truth of demise
No journey into the
Reachless skies

6. Virulent Rapture

I see behind the screams
Bore into their stricken minds
Labyrinthine passages of smoke
Consumed by madness divine

Ecstasy from misery, unholy sorcery
Chance to recapture
Monarchy and cruelty, transcendent blasphemy
My virulent rapture

Mundane human suffering
Will not sustain me long
Inflicting my own terrors
Upon banquet shall I gorge

Ecstasy from misery, unholy sorcery
Chance to recapture
Monarchy and cruelty, transcendent blasphemy
My virulent rapture

Feeding on torturous horrors
My pain bloated face smiles
Parasite and the victim
Living is their only crime

Condemned to their tepid world
But on their pain I thrive
Infinite the moment for me
So old ravaged by time

Born and ruled as king
Now ermine swapped for rags
Dethroned and cast out
Their pain my pathway back

Condemned to their tepid world
But on their pain I thrive
Infinite the moment for me
So old ravaged by time

Ecstasy from misery, unholy sorcery
Chance to recapture
Monarchy and cruelty, transcendent blasphemy
My virulent rapture

Condemned to their tepid world
But on their pain I thrive

Born and ruled as king,
their screams my pathway back

7. Life

How the time
Has worn on
Reflecting life
And future
Decisions made
Past and present
Where I stand
Is at the peak

And here I am ruler
And here I stand King
The right things done
Satan guides me

A life's worth more than life's worth to
You, king of the Jews

I learned your lies and I learned the truth
I learned your creed and I learned your noose
I learned your lies and I learned your ways
I saw your blood and I saw your death

I taught your lies and I taught my ways
I taught my kin and I taught him sin
I taught about hate and about intolerance
I spoke of honesty, I spoke of truth

A life more than, than your life
A life's more than a life's worth to
You, king of the Jews

8. To Wield The Hand Of Perdition

Here in the dark of the godless depths
Eternally I dwell
Long ago forsaken to
Lie and burn in fire
Castigation my soul binds
To the demonic winds
I am born as the planets align
At long last unconfined

Subterranean swarm
Sulphurous hordes
Satanic carrion calls
Slouching towards War

Grant me their pain, grant me their unending suffering
As my legions carve through them in howling torment
Grasping for their skulls I kill, bodies fall before my will
I denounce their master as I walk over their corpses

I shall drink the messiah's blood and lay his arrogance low
His broken body pitiful sacrament to maggots
His effigies crushed to dust ,from this day abandoned
I shall destroy these mortal lands, razing them to the ground

And so I cast my arm to the North, and hell roams close behind
Raising high my throne adorned with entrails, flame and bone
Rejecting divine falsehood, I shall become the sun's bane
Through communion with the dark lord I shall rule this dominion

Grant me their pain.

9. Of Witchery And The Blood Moon

As the sun sets I cast off
My waking flesh as it dissolves
Into ether the bonds that
Chain me here

Hear my call and guide my hand,
Hear these words of adoration
Blood of the witch awakens
Ever seeking promethean light
Illumination
Darkness' promise revealed
The eyes of Hecate
Tearing through the veil

Manifold are the mysterious
Blessings of the sevenfold curse
The key to immortality
Her insidious harvest

Down the generations I can feel her presence
Encircling my body claim my soul for your own

From the black, come forth
And light the roads to the underworld

Tea rmy skin and drink of my blood
Reduce me to nothingness

To know sheer antinomian will
To dare to lose yourself in it's depth

From the black, come forth
Cloak me and light the roads to the underworld


10. Immateria

11. Paths Of Silence

Lost is the straight path
To the edges of consciousness
Gates of horn and ivory
Crown a lake of bitterness

Wraiths line the fields of this hell
Consumed with vain regret
Blind worms ignorant
Of knowledge in the self

These madmen and lepers
Do themselves condemn
In dreams of abberration
Drowning insipid vermin
Is there nothing beyond?

Is there nothing before me?
Radiance of the void
Dis staring back at me

Purify the vessel
In darkness pain no more
Open my weary eyes
Smash the gates to the abyss

The only apotheosis is bloody tears
And the wretched laughter of the gods

Flame surrounds me
Raging columns burn
Circles of the dead
By the light of the seven pointed star

Hidden in secret ciphers and edicts of fire
Spectres reappear and fade
As I rend the branches
of the tree of death
Lost in sorrow and
forgotten desire

Sacred night enshroud my soul as
offering to the who
dwells beyond
I am become timeless amongst
you, as I embrace the silence

1. Intro: The Shams of Optimism

An hour away from home,
The lights come on.
Standing at the side of the road,
I am in awe.
Amongst the snow and trees,
The freezing cold,
I thrive on each sorrowful note.
For the moment, all is still,
A tranquil pace.
The ease of being stranded,
In this compassionate place
Amongst the snow and trees,
The air is cold and clean,
and for the moment, I am at peace.
Being able to enjoy a disaster
is a sham of being so optimistic.
Now that the thrill has worn off,
and the adventure has lost it's charm,
I just want to go home.
Still waiting at the side of the road,
The hours have passed, since I last moved.
Head down, eyes closed,
Into a suspended sleep I fall.
Then in sequence, from far to near,
Light reflects off of objects before...
A sun, of the darkest blues,
Rises from the hills behind...

2. Crossing the 45th Parallel

To pass between, these winter walls,
While traveling at night,
Taken by reflection,
I mine my life
The trees have seen me come this way,
Many times at any hours.
They stand on both sides,
And greet me, as I pass.
A time and place, where winter begins,
I see inspiring sights.
Reminiscent of years gone by,
I mine my life.
I am, being expected,
by those who are waiting at home.
Taking caution,
knowing I'm guided by white lines covered in snow.
On occasion I pass through,
From the life I build,
To the life I knew.
Only the trees would have seen,
Who held the wheel.
Only they would have seen,
When I grew tired of travel.
Only the trees would have seen,
Who held the wheel.
Only they would have seen,
When I lost control.
In desperate times, in such desperation,
This long road traveled once left me behind.
Now used, for gaining momentum,
The theme of it all,
Defines my life.


3. The Sea of Immeasurable Loss

Who knows how long I've stood here...
Or how many times.
I may wander, but I will return,
The same time each night.
For running water plays the score to this scene.
I stand and stare into the mirror.
This has become so familiar to me,
Because I no longer rest where I used to sleep.
A handful of water to cool your face
will be the only comfort you'll know.
So pick up your heart and run for your life.
To drain your body of all it's energy.
For heavy steps on a quiet path,
Is the sound of earning your rest.

Try to sleep
on the other side of the room.
Forget all the time you have lost
For it's the insight...that kills you.
This night will end,
Only to begin again.
And nothing will change until the change of the seasons
Many months away.
The night is long,
Exhausted I make my way home.
As the earliest of those begin their day,
I finally begin to sleep.
This strain that resolves in me,
Truly has come at a cost,
For the rain, that falls on me,
Was drawn, from the sea of immeasurable loss.

4. A Meeting Place and Time

A meeting place and time.
Our chance to make amends.
Weather to meet as planned,
Or reach out for, the cold, upper hand.

A meeting place and time.
Of which neither of them would show.
A meeting Place and Time.
A meeting place and time.
Pictured in our minds.
To stand up, from a table,
And prepare for the outside.

A meeting place and time.
Neither of them would show.
A meeting place and time.
Neither of them would know.
'I wouldn't miss it for the world.'
with that having been said,
Could you be careful with your words,
Because my world is in your hands.
It was a year ago today,
I put a desperate man to death.
He was the man I used to be,
He trusted every word you said.

You can wait no more...it's time to go home.
I hope it's cold, everyday, where you are...
For this place, is where neither of us will meet.
For this time when neither of us will wait.
And this is the end of this burden of yours and mine.
This is the end, of this well rehearsed story of you and I.
This meeting place and time.
The story of you and I.

5. Awaiting the Inevitable

Drawing meaning from the unexpected,
A sign that cannot be denied.
A portrait of our everlasting expressions,
And the distance between us, side by side.
Nearing the end of this long discussion,
Still struggling for what more to say,
A man of words trying to argue his point,
With someone, who can afford to walk away.
This conflict of interest,
Of whether to act and indulge,
Or risk waiting for the greater gain,
That may never come.
I'm always pushing my luck,
for nothing is ever good enough.
While you strive to protect,
what you already have for nothing will ever be as good as it was.
[clean]
A look held too long, or maybe not long enough,
in the perfect setting which complicates us.
While we await the inevitable end,
We enjoy the inevitable events.
For everyday that passes we lessen the risk.
For everyday that passes makes much more sense.
While we await the inevitable end,
We enjoy the inevitable events.
And now...a new tension,
This one of silence...
A late morning gaze out of the window,
from inside a cold apartment.
We look out, we look away,
Anywhere but at each other.

1. Intro: The Looming of Dust in the Dark (& the Illumination)

Sunlight shines
On the clothes that lay on a chair
A desk covered in clutter
The floor covered in hair

It shines on a figure, so thin and frail
It shines on his skin, so sick and pale
It shines on the wall, where for so long
I have stared
Breaking the spell of authentic despair

As my eyes come into focus
I turn to face to face the room
The movement from the sheets creates a breeze
Sweeps the dust from its place

It so quietly swarms
And hangs in the air
It shines in the light
And makes me aware

Death is looming in here
And it's getting to you
Under dust, over time
It has been burying you

It now stirs up the room
As it enters my sight
Rising up from the dark
From the surface it lies

As if hinting to me
To choose day over night
To leave all of this dark
And seek the warmth of the light

Outside this room where my life wastes away
Her priorities lie
In collecting corks from bottles she plans to make into things


2. The Will to Give

I had built up all of my hopes and all of my plans
Only to have them stand and cast shadows of humiliation
Days would pass shadows would remain
A reminder of all of my dreams
I had to live humbled with
The disappointment of what never came to be

I vow from this day forward
My grieving will be brief
That I will continue to give to this world
Knowing I may never receive

I had come so far
Before being stripped and sent back to the start
It felt as though the air was tearing me apart

A hybrid of seasons had come
It swept across the land
It spared the lives of everyone else
While it destroyed everything I had done

The frost came in the night
My progress immortalized
All that I had left undone
Would be forever, frozen in time

I became known for this curse
It happened throughout my life
It needed to continue to occur
In order to keep my legacy alive

Before I know my time had arrived
It was already gone
Cursing the cold winds of change
My moment of peace was just the eye of the storm

The will to live is easy
You can exist without a care
The will to die shows it meant so much
That you couldn't have it - and you couldn't go on living without it

The will to give makes the best of nothing
It is a philosophy
That states you will continue to give to this world
Knowing you may never receive.

Satisfaction will come and in time it will leave us unsatisfied
As uncertainty returns
Bringing back the excitement to our lives
We can only enjoy so much stimulation
Before we stop responding and become despondent again.

I had built up all of my hopes and all of my plans
Only to have them stand and cast shadows of humiliation
Days would pass shadows would remain
A reminder of all of my dreams
I had to live humbled with
The disappointment of what never came to be

Those shadows still remain as landmarks of failed attempts
In their shade I work away at building a tower of character
One day it will be revealed and it will stand for man years
Casting a shadow of its own and striking fear in hearts - as will I

It is the discomfort that sets us apart
That wakes us up, that puts us to sleep
It is our pathetic moments
Which make us desire to be great

It is the starving itself
That makes us hungry to want more
Over time as you learn to fall
You'll rise to your feet faster than the time before

Satisfaction is a peak on the verge of decline
It will be over in the blink of an eye
Take your time to feel every moment
A gradual climb will let you enjoy it

For your life is measured
By the degree of dynamic from your life to your death
The wait is long and the wait goes on
But it is better to travel hopefully than to arrive

Through the crests and troughs
I will have seen both sides
By the Pursuit of the Sun and the Allure of the Earth
I will have earned and spent my life

The will to give
There is no destination
There is only the journey


3. The Sun was in My Eyes: Part One

The sun was in my eyes
It blackened my sight
I was high with conviction
That I was invincible

The sun was in my eyes
I was stricken blind
I believed I could see through the dark
As I followed the un-guiding light

Pursuing the sun
While causes of mine are still alive
But barely carry on

Pursuing the sun
While friends lay in beds
Recovering from their recklessness

Give in to all the temptation
Give up on all your beliefs
Forget the feeling of the changing of seasons
Wishing that summer would go on forever
How long before it would get old
Would you miss looking forward to when it starts to get cold

The sun was in my eyes
It came through the trees
Consumed all of my mind
It was all I could see

The sun was in my eyes
Something became of my life
I left all else behind
And starred into the light

The sun was in my eyes
Putting it off for a rainy day
When it pours I'll stay indoors
To try to make things right

The sun was in my eyes
Thin ice on a summer's day
As I procrastinate
It falls apart and melts away

Pursuing the sun
While causes of mine are still alive
But barely carry on

Pursuing the sun
While friends lay in beds
Recovering from their recklessness

Going after the pleasures of summer
Betray the comforts of our dark little space
Believe their healing will cure all your trauma
Becoming the person you've claim to hate
True colors are shining through
Trading the black for the yellow, green and blue

The sun was in my eyes
It came through the trees
Consumed all of my mind
It was all I could see

The sun was in my eyes
Something became of my life
I left all else behind
And starred into the light

When summer came
I was overcome
Pursuing the sun and its hot summer days
On the long road on the way to the grave


4. The Sun was in My Eyes: Part Doom

The sun was in my eyes
It came through the trees
Consumed all of my mind
It was all I could see

The sun was in my eyes
Something became of my life
I left all else behind
And starred into the light

The sun was in my eyes
I could not see
Please find it in your heart
To forgive me

Pursuing the sun because you can
But still tell the night you'll still see each other now and again
Let him down softly, be polite
Reassure him all the same that things will be like they've always have been

A fragile boy
With needs on you he depends
Who measures how much
It all meant to you by how quickly you left

A fragile boy
With needs on you he depends
With your negligence
You have pushed him to the edge

It was the darkness that kept us together...
...It was the light that led you away

You control our destiny
Reduce it back to an idea
I beg of you from agony
Please conform to decency

The sun was in my eyes
It came through the trees
Consumed all of my mind
It was all I could see

The sun was in my eyes
Something became of my life
I left all else behind
And starred into the light

The sun is shallow
It will shine for anyone
The night is loyal
Only to those who are true
Time will fly as you pursue the sun
But the night will be long and cold
And it will wait for you at home

When summer came
I was overcome
Something lost for something gained
Pursuing the sun and it's hot summer days
On the long, backstabbing back-road on the way to the grave


5. Allure of the Earth

The sun taunts you
In everything you do
Like a substance that works for everyone else
But has no effect on you

It shines for places
You'll never go
It shines for people
You'll never know

You believe that in your entire life
You will never feel
What it's like

So you turn away
Dream about an escape
A hole in the earth deep and cool
That you could climb down into

I despise the rising
Of the upsetting sun
I'll hide away
Until the day is done

I'll exclude myself
A few months of every year
To avoid the drama
Of the sun, sweat and tears

You could fall away
And no one would know
Release the tension of holding on
Feel the high of letting go

So you turn away
Elude the pressures of the sun
Go find your place in the shade
Far away from everyone

It's so easy to get your fill
When the engine turns and pushes in the dirt
It's so easy to be satisfied
When all you want to do is lay down and die

The Allure of the Earth
Those dreams can come true
When you make a deal with the earth
Who says...
"Here's what I can do for you..."

The Allure of the Earth
When you are through with trying
When you are tired and days are long
Letting go seems so inviting

The Allure of the Earth
The desire to give up
It is the encouragement
When you are discouraged

The Allure of the Earth
When the urges aren't worth fighting
The temptations on the great beyond
Become so exciting


6. Shedding the Deadwood

It's no wonder I've felt so tired
I've witnessed the careless all running past me
While I've been told to ignore my desires
And grow numb with understanding

I walk through theses woods
I carry this deadwood
I am determined to see this through
Driven only by the guilt and the shame of giving up
I must complete what I set out to do - For you

It stayed on a shelf made of my arms
They had grown strong from giving support
I knew that my arms could hold out forever
It was my mind that'd grow tired
And in time would let go

It's been so long since I have questioned
What it is that I really want
Instead I follow your directions
As you lead me on

I can't use it to build my home
It will not fulfill my desires
Some wood can be used to help build a life
This wood will be used for building a fire

Why carry this deadwood with me...
...when were I'm going there will be living trees

Now close enough to carry it all to the end
But throwing it all to the ground instead

This bundle of deadwood
The pieces they fall
Corners indent the soil and accumulate on one another
Tumble down and pile up

It awkwardly spills like myself at a time
Like the time it had killed
Like every moment after it was collected and held

I'd give up all that I started
To pursue all that I wanted
I may arrive empty handed
But at least I will arrive


7. Dragged Across a Forest Floor

Another era has come to an end
You'll return to where it began
Wandering at night on Ypres Rd.
To determine why you walk in the woods alone

A piece of out history I used to honour
They disrespected and disgraced
They took the ground upon which I walked
And rubbed it in my face

To me these woods are but a forest of metaphors
And nothing more
A path through the woods of my past
Where I was dragged across a forest floor

They breathe in the stagnant air
The poison sky shelters them from the sun
No exposure, nothing grows
No one ever wonders what lies beyond

So set in their old ways
They could only hope for change
Instead they flaunt their stubborn pride
Digging their own graves

To me these woods are but a forest of metaphors
And nothing more
A path through the woods of my past
Where I was dragged across a forest floor

I see the truth hidden between the trees
These tough woods are but delicate forest
Everyone for themselves in the hallowed name of unity

Finding comfort in their misery
They were doomed beyond the reach of help
Saved only by the unconditional love
Of hate for a place they couldn't live without

All that I hoped to change
Would not be reversed by words alone
It would require all of their efforts
The lack of which was already set in stone

At a time when I could take no more
I was dragged across a forest floor

Sticks and stones
The combined discomfort of hundreds of pains
Thorns and Needles
I pull them out of my skin
While walking home

Accept the fact that they've missed your point
Conceal your motives and all your thoughts
Keep your opinions to yourself
Give them exactly what they want

There's no hope for understanding
Our differences would not be solved
For my survival and my sanity
In time I learned to have tolerance for you all

Bite your tongue until it bleeds
Choke down the blood so no one sees
Fight the tears
Let them fall within
While you're here
Never let your weakness show

These woods are full of hope
These woods are where I walk alone

Even at times
When standing still
Strength and speed
Still lie dormant within
You will see me channel the pain
As blood leaves my core and fills my veins

These woods are but a forest of metaphors
And nothing more

The tall trees above
They are the ones that exist
The fallen leaves are those that have fallen to my feet
The trails of broken branches
These are the mistakes you make
The seeds are the ones to be that I push in the earth
With every step I take


8. Summer's Envy

How dare you subject me
To Summer's Envy
I will shine brighter than the day you left me
You will see traces of you in my revenge
Which is in everything I do

When summer comes
Your spotlight is the sun
You can do as you please
And get whatever you want

How dare you subject me
To Summer's Envy
I will shine brighter than the day you left me
You will see traces of you as I avenge
Everything you put me through

In the daytime
When everyone can see
It makes you look so good
Being cruel to me

How dare you subject me
To Summer's Envy
I will shine brighter than the day you left me
On that day you may have had my jealousy
But in time I will have yours and you will envy me

The summer sun may soothe your pain
As you escape to bathe in its rays
But you'll still come home to drown in me
Or at least where I used to be

The things I've said
The sound of my laugh
My hopes and dreams
Where I lay with you
Your memories of me

How dare you subject me
To Summer's Envy
I will shine brighter than the day you left me
One day I'll be able to make my peace with you
But not until years of revenge come true


9. The Ghosts of Summer's Past

There is a comfort in longing for
Something that's gone forever
It shows how much that something meant to you
When it was here

To a person who claims
To never having had anything
They can be confronted by
The empty space where something once was

I could only remember feeling so bad
When the present time was passing by
Looking back now I realise
That the best and worst times in my life
Could coincide

My greatest achievement is also my greatest loss
The best thing I ever had is forever gone

It is a dark and fulfilling feeling of frustration
To reminisce and feel the opposite of anticipation

It is a talent of the soul
To discover the joys in pain
Thinking of moments you long for
Knowing you'll never have them again

A moment of euphoria
Inspired by a photograph from that summer
I remember how we hated everything
And in that we managed to find comfort in each other

Those days are gone, my heart goes on
I long for the way it used to be
When summer comes it will return
That feeling will become again
It comes on strong and so fast
But you know that it won't last
It's just the hauntings of
The ghosts of summer's past

And though they are far behind me
I can still hear them calling
As if they were right beside me
Tempting my comfort in longing


10. Outro: The End of August

On a county road
Under the purple sky
Fields of nothing
At our sides
The End of August
And into autumn
We stood at the edge
And watched the storm

The End of August
And into autumn
We prepare to get serious again

On a county road
Under the purple sky
Fields of nothing
At our sides
The End of August
And into autumn
We stood at the edge
And watched the storm

The End of August
And into autumn
A year from now I'll be so far away

On a county road
Under the purple sky
Fields of nothing
At our sides
The End of August
And into autumn
We stood at the edge
And watched the storm

1. The Northern Cold

Mine was that of a quiet love deep and true.

I'm at home in the North, when I'm alone in the Northern Cold
And I belong in the North, when I'm at home in the Northern Cold

If you seek understanding, I will try to explain to you
The origins of my madness, and my strength in solitude
Seldom seen, seldom spoken
My heart was my compass, and it was broken
Mine was that of a quiet love, deep and true.

I'm at home in the North, when I'm alone in the Northern Cold
And I belong in the North, when I'm at home in the Northern Cold

If you seek understanding, I will show you what we have known
The long ride on the road to nowhere
The cold walks in the woods alone
In my ocean, the water was frozen
And I could see my reflection, within the ice
Mine was that of a quiet love, deep and true.

I'm at home in the North, when I'm alone in the Northern Cold
And I belong in the North, when I'm at home in the Northern Cold
Years later I am still obsessed (with the North)
Years later still restless and depressed (from the Northern Cold)
Years later I still drown in passion for my sorrows
Years later I'm alone, and I'm at home in the Northern Cold

My blues are so dark they are black. The roots are buried, so deep in the past.
See my roots, for they are true. Feel my blues, for they are real.

The feel of cold, the black of night, the white of snow,
Walking home, the smell of smoke, these are the memories of my youth.


2. Iron Grudge

We dug this hole for ourselves, but we'll gladly bury you instead
After having sacrificed yourselves, by standing in our way

I can hold the Iron Grudge, like a fist!
I can hold the Iron Grudge, for as long as I live

Can you feel the hatred, from your fellow man?
Can you see his ignorance? Unfortunately I can.

There's nothing more to say. There's nothing to discuss.
Enough words have already been heard. Enough deeds, been done.
You are not a mystery to us. We know exactly who you are.
And for as long as you might live, you are dead to us.
We dug this hole for ourselves, but we'll gladly bury you instead
After having sacrificed yourselves, by standing in our way

I can hold the Iron Grudge, like a fist!
I can hold the Iron Grudge, for as long as I live

Can you feel the envy, from you fellow man?
Can you see his ignorance? Unfortunately I can.

There's nothing more to say. There's nothing to discuss.
For I can see the fear in your eyes as you try to act tough
And as we rise up from the muck, we are filled with disgust (even more)
To realize that you ever thought, you were in the same league as us
We dug this hole for ourselves, but we'll gladly bury you instead
After having sacrificed yourselves, by standing in our way

I can hold the Iron Grudge, like a fist!
I can hold the Iron Grudge, and never lose my grip

I'm not your stepping-stone, I'm not your fucking crutch.
And for as long as you might live, I can hold the Iron Grudge!

I can hold the Iron Grudge!
Long live the Iron Grudge!

So go ahead and waste your time, it will keep you further behind!
Suffer!


3. Your Ontario Town Is A Burial Ground

Ever since I was born in a northern town
I've been digging myself out
From a time when I hadn't seen
Anything worth remembering

I would aspire to better life
To feast my eyes and expand my mind
I'd lie awake, I could not wait
To leave this place behind

Your Ontario town is just a burial ground
For old friends
Your Ontario town is just a burial ground

Inspired by hopelessness
From where my discontent once began
I miss the nature and the wilderness
But not the people there

As old stores will close their doors
Other ones may change their names
But old friends still live their lives
Where I would have died of shame
Your Ontario town is just a burial ground
For old friends
Your Ontario town is just a burial ground

You say that you grew up
You say that you tried
I think you took the easy way out
I say you gave up
I say you died

You'll say that you're content
You'll say there's no regrets
But I think you took the easy way out
For if you're not dreaming anymore
You're already dead

What a shame for those who chose
To be wasted in the north
What a shame to know nothing more
Than the town where you were born
Your Ontario town is just a burial ground
For old friends
Your Ontario town is just a burial ground

Kick over the stone that bares your name
I spit on the snow that covers your grave


4. Through Chaos And Solitude I Came...

Ripping down the valley of asphalt
Through a brainstorm of snow and ice
Where dynamite blasted the Canadian Shield, I ride
Highways 17 and 69

I understand the relation
Of black metal and modern life
How a cold winter scene
Can inspire distortion and screams

I am equal parts blood and ice
I am just as much man as tree
Through chaos and solitude I came
To become this black metal being

Each day I could see the changes
Each day I became more extreme
I understood how the sight of nature
Could inspire the sound of machines
I am equal parts blood and ice
I am just as much man as tree
Through chaos and solitude I came
To become this black metal being

I've traveled over dynamic earth at night
On highways 17 and 69
For the beauty of nature can lift my spirits
Even in the dead of winter.

Modern life can drive us to scream for the trees...(in harmony)
For those of us who can't find peace, at least we can have a release.

I understand the translation
Universal in human behaviour
A common expression and interpretation
Of Black Metal and modern life

Focused and strong
Without distraction, I look within
No one to talk me out of what I believe
Without reaction, I proceed.

I was on my own and alone to decide
Black metal was all that mattered, at the time
I found faith inspired by nature
And I was defined.
I am equal parts blood and ice
I am just as much man as tree
Through chaos and solitude I came
To become this black metal being

On this northern highway, under the starry sky
Mine was a cold, nocturnal, winter ride

And in the distance...
A stranger flashed his lights...


5. Years Of Silence (And The Private Joke)

We stood in the sand we stared at the stars
What good is any of it now?
These were the moments in our lives
That invoked years of silence
And after all that we had done
We had become...(the private joke).

We knew the risks and we were willing to take them
And so we went through with it, and it would forever change us
We were those who felt they were desperate to live
We were those who'd let their hearts, beat themselves to death
We stood in the sand we stared at the stars
What good is any of it now?
These were the moments in our lives
That invoked years of silence
And after all that we had done
We had become...(the private joke).

We couldn't go back to the way it was before
We would go our separate ways and never tell anyone
But what good are memories with no one to stand beside you?
What good are memories if those you made them with despise you?
We stood in the sand we stared at the stars
What good is any of it now?
These were the moments in our lives
That invoked years of silence
And after all that we had done
We had become...(the private joke).


6. Distractions Of Living Alone

When I come home at the end of the day, everything is just where I left it...
No one has called, nothing has changed, everything is just how I left it...

I haven't spoken a word in days, except for cursing the noise in the hall...
I haven't spoken a word in days, to anyone else at all...

And so, as I go, I'll leave my body for you...
And so, as I go, don't feel sorry for me
For life is the sacrifice, before you die
And so as I go, I'll leave my body for you...to...see...

A bed all alone in the bedroom
A vacant space where a table should be
Some posters on the walls
The bathroom mirror covered in spit

I have made such desperate attempts to make this a nice place to live...
And I have failed, for I have tried to fill this dead empty space with a life!

All this time on my hands,
And I have no where to go,
Haunted by the distractions of living alone

I hope you'd be the first one to find me
After I'd concluded the past behind me
So hold your hands, over your mouth
And run to tell the others...


7. Deepest Roots: Belief That All Is Lost

Have you ever wondered what the world would be like without you?
If you murdered your dreams and we buried you
The thought that was the bitter seed, the subterranean trajectory
That was thrust deep within the earth, and grew into a twisted tree

The origins of modern sadness, to obsess over life and death
While life is short and growth is slow, patience is the task at hand
While the wait for happiness, can be agony
An eternity in death, can be much more easily achieved

It's the truth in true despair, deepest roots, darkest blues
The belief that all is lost, and that nothing can be done

How sad life can be when those, who once-wanted, don't want anymore
And when those who already have it, can't see it, for what it's worth
The frustration that as soon as you think that it is all just meaningless
You are proven wrong again, when you find meaning at the end...


8. Darkest Blues: Relief That Nothing Can Be Done

Shallow within the earth, buried deep beneath the snow
You would remain forever young while the rest of us grow old
We would act upon our guilt, a northern burial was your wish
We would obey and fulfill, for your importance is strengthened by your early death

It's the truth in true despair, deepest roots, darkest blues
The belief that all is lost, and that nothing can be done

Forever frozen, never to decompose, your body would be preserved
While we all live, and struggle on, and inherit, the life that you deserved
Your youthful looks remembered, your dignity retained
While there would be no relief for us, and we'd look worse everyday
It's the truth in true despair, deepest roots, darkest blues
The belief that all is lost, and that nothing can be done

In our minds and in our hearts, in frames, you image will hang
On the walls of grieving homes and other places you would never go again

Imagine the things they would say about you, as if they really knew
How your death was premature, but your life was overdue.

You have already spent your better years taking your time for granted
It will be yours in the end, but at what price
To have wasted, your entire life
Wishing it all away...Death is a Tease!

To venture into the thought of despair and pull yourself back together again,
Knowing you had once stood on the edge and almost dove in.
Everything had driven me there, another lesson, best learned young:
When you want it, you can't have it, when you don't want it, it's done.

For all our guilt, for all our lies, for all we care, we'd gather together to say goodbye
As if the dead can't see the living, they would volunteer to twist the truth
For the comfort of each other and say "He was a good friend of mine."
Make the choice, to stay alive! Existence is your only hope to fight!
Not for the love of life or the fear of death, but to save the lies from the breath...

...of the ones around you, who would speak and cry,
And the ones around you who would fake and lie,
Who would say that they knew you and that you would be missed,
As a storm of admiration buries you again.


9. The Thrill Of The Struggle

The fire still burns, when you are gone. Life in the North goes on without you.
My fire will burn, with you or not. My passion will overcome.

Year's end, coming home, and what do you have to show for yourself?
I amount to nothing more, than what they understand.
Feel the sense of confusion, for your wins you cannot explain.
See the lack of comprehension, over the ground you worked so hard to gain.

The fire still burns, when you are gone.
My fire will burn, with you or not.

We live for the thrill of the struggle.
We live for the love of our sorrows.

I fight the fight I can never win, but I fight the fight for the fight itself.
And so I am rich with failure? Brutal north, bring me down again.

I guess these are the risks you take, when you've been gone for so many years.
Would they even look up from their tables, if suddenly you appeared?
The fire still burns, when you are gone.
My fire will burn, with you or not.

We live for the thrill of the struggle.
We live for the love of our sorrows.
Brutal north bring me down.
Brutal north bring me down again.
I stood at the foot of the mill again, like a metaphor of northern time.
I watched them burn off the excess, flames to the sky
The fire still burns, when your are gone
My fire will burn, with you or not

So many small losses, for one giant gain
Quiet victories spent alone, along the way
Now I wander the streets as out of place as the day I left
No better off. Nothing has changed. These are the risks we take...I guess?
Brutal north bring me down.
Brutal north bring me down again.


10. December In Windsor

Trying hard to enjoy the night, to make the best of my time
And I would kill to know what it's like to feel tonight
With each cold sip of life, which helps to numb the pain
Each touch of the glass to my lips, helps ease the strain.

It's been so long, it's been so much
Though I would shudder at your sight
I would still shatter at your touch

For I feel like ice this evening, walking down the stairs/stares
Hidding my face into the basement, as if anyone cares.
That oh I'm out tonight. I'm out to try to live tonight.
For tomorrow it may seem as though I never did.
It's been so long, it's been so much
Though I would shudder at your sight
I would still shatter at your touch

I remember December in Windsor, 2002
I remember feeling much older, than twenty-two

The season was cold, and I was alone, developing tastes for poisons.
This was my old haunt, and it haunted me still.


11. Trillium: The Third Of Three Winters

12. Song Of Redemption

I am not, that good anymore, and maybe I never was,
But I'll play my heart out for you, one more time.
For in my old age, all I can do is play for you a song from my youth.

So let me share my gift, with you once more,
Just like we had in the past, so many times before.

My hands may shake, my muscles are weak,
I'm not strong as I used to be.
But still I will play for you, and leave you with a song,
For when you have music you're never alone.

Let me share my gift, with you once more
Just like we had in the past, so many times before
The song of redemption is all that I am,
For in the end, the music is all that I have.

And though it feels incomplete, the deadline has come for me.
I must present to you, My 'masterpiece'...
For time is short in my condition, the song of redemption
Will be the final composition, from this tired musician.

Please give me your attention and I will remedy, this silent tension
And I hope that you will remember,
I hope the memories will leave a lasting impression
Of me, when I'm gone. Gone. After I am gone.

I don't need to concentrate, I can close my eyes.
And though you'll hear this song but once,
I've rehearsed it, a thousand times.

But what will you say, after I'm done?
After I've attempted to play the song of redemption.
And what will you say, after I'm gone?
After I've attempted to play the song of redemption.


13. End Of Tradition

It's never too late to admit that you were wrong, when the journey has made you wise enough to know the time has come, to end the tradition.

We came this far, to admit that we were wrong and the time we wasted, has made us who we are.

Though the recovery has just begun, it will one day be complete,
For we are forever in transition, blazing paths of radical change.

With our interest in good intentions, satisfied.
We leave with peace even though we failed, knowing at least we tried.

Lessons learned, perspective earned, clear sight on the highway drive at night.
A bigger picture is on the horizon, and the view is easy on the eyes.

It was what it was but it will be no more.
From now on we are only going forward (without you).
For no more will we invest our time.
Repairing unions or rekindling old fires.

The highway was once the only thing between us, but it is all that connects us now.
Sever all ties! Cut your losses and run!
One thing we have learned, from the cycle of repetition,
Patterns of negative thought always bring you back to the same old places.

No more will we waste our time, with those who have lost touch
No more will we reach out to them, or let them come to us
Let the void of your presence, be the voice that speaks in your turn
Let the ashes of the past be sifted by those who let it burn.

No more will we gather, on occasion in the same place
No more will we continue to recognize a common faith
No more will we travel, long distances to maintain our bond
No more will we unite as one, this is the end of tradition.

At the opposite ends of a void, the highways divide us forevermore!


14. To Lock Eyes With A Wild Beast

For those who think they are brave
Because they've never been afraid.
Who judge those enduring consequences,
When they have always been saved.

To all those ignorant fucks who've always suckled from the teat:
I hope, one day, you'll meet your fate
Locking eyes with the 'wild beast'.

For those who think they have all the answers,
Though they've never been tested.
Who are defiant to the rules of the world,
Though they've never had to face it, themselves.
To all those ignorant fucks who've always suckled from the teat:
I hope, one day, you'll meet your fate
Locking eyes with the 'wild beast'.

Not to be taken by your fellow man, not to be taken by your own hand,
Not having succumbed to disease, but having faced the wild beast.

For after only one glance of the beast, in the blink of an eye,
The young dawn, that was your life, has suddenly turned into midnight.

As if it fell from the sky, your jaw drops in awe.
Piss your self in fear. No clever language will save you here

As you slowly quicken the pace, as you try to slip away,
Just as you think you will be okay...
You realize you've become the chase...Run!

Let her take you down. Let her take you in her mouth.
The moonlight reflecting in her eyes,
The moonlight is shinning off her cold, sharp claws.

Let her tear you limb from limb, let nature take its course.
Let her kill and devour, kill and devour and kill some more.

Memories are flashing before your eyes of old friends & dead relatives.
With hallucinations induced from being eaten alive.

Where no one could hear you scream, where no one could see you cry,
An unlikely fate in present day, man and beast, face to face.

You went looking for thrills and adventure, they came looking for you as well.
You wanted nature? Nature wanted you as well.

At the scene of the mauling, black cloth and blood in the snow.
Surrounded by a crowd of trees you will be, but cold bones in the spring.


15. Mistakes Artists Make (The Dream Is Dead)

Rejection from ourselves, will only lead to reflection in the peace and quiet
The sooner we quit trying to find the sound, the sooner we'll find ourselves instead.

Suffering the pains taken, dwelling in the pain of creation.
For the artist's mistakes, stare him in the face for years after, they are made.

To love music more than life itself, is such a waste, of life, and love, and hell.
Modern desires to create euphoric misery we make for ourselves.

For modern music is self-indulgent, we have always done it for ourselves.
For it is not a matter of life and death, but life only and itself.

To live is to light a torch and carry it as far as you can go,
Before the winds blow so hard, the flame goes out
As you fall crashing down, to the snow.
Knowing at least that when you fail,
Someone could relight that torch
And carry it the rest of the way, someday,
In honor of you and who you were to them

It's never too late to admit you were wrong. It's never to late to admit what you need.
...Beautiful to have come, beautiful to see, but also beautiful to leave.

To anyone who ever said: "You'll never work in this town again!"...
There is nothing more you can take from us now. This is the end...'my friend'.

The dream is dead!!! (The dream is dead!)
The scene is dead!!! (The scene is dead!)
The dream is dead!!! (Long live the dream!)
The dream is dead!

1. Shards Of Love (Hurt Forever)

You pulled your things off the walls, took all that was yours.
You packed your books into boxes and placed them at the door.
You emptied your half of our closet, and went through the drawers.
Taking it all for granted and left what was left for me on the floor.

And still I'm pouring my heart out to you, trying to move you.
Still I'm pouring my heart out to you, trying to get you to stay.
Still I'm pouring my heart out to you, trying to move you.
Still I'm pouring my heart out to you, trying to get you to stay.

And I said, "What about this? What about that? Don't you remember the good times?
What about this? What about that? Don't you remember our life?"
She said, "What about this? And what about that? Don't you remember the hard times?
What about this? And what about that? Don't you remember our lives?"

And I said, "No, wait. (No, wait)."
And she said, "No, it's too late. (No, it's too late)."
And I said, "Wait, please stay. (Wait, please stay)."
But she said, "No, I'm going away. (I'm going away)."

And I said, "No, you cannot go."
And I said, "Wait, please stay."
She said, "No, I have to go. It's too late, I'm going away.
And there's nothing in the world that you could say to make me stay."

You pulled your things off the walls, took all that was yours.
You packed your books into boxes and placed them at the door.
You emptied your half of our closet, and went through the drawers.


2. Everything I Touch Turns To Gold (Then To Coal)

Woe, oh

I am in denial, and I am depressed
I will try to bargain with you, then share my anger with you
But I can't complete the full cycle of mourning
I struggle with acceptance
I can't forgive myself

Everything I touch turns to gold, then to coal
Everything I touch turns to rust, then to dust

My clothes are full of holes, hanging off my tired body
I command so much negativity, my charge drains the life from machinery
But I feel such powerlessness, when I struggle with forgiveness
Yet I don't know my own strength, when I destroy everything

Woe, oh

I am in denial, and I am depressed


3. By The Time You Read This (I Will Already Be Dead)

By the time you read this, I will already be dead
Do not reply to this, it is only to be read
By the time you read this, I will already have been killed
Do not reply to this, but notify my next of kin

Self administrate your estate,
Pick up the pieces and give them away
Let them take all the things they want and dispose of yourself

Photos and notes go into the sink
Under all the hot water the faucet could give
Now my dreams are just running ink
Going down the dream

By the time you read this, I will already be gone
Do not reply to this, but realize what you have done
By the time you read this, it will already be true
Do not reply to this, just understand what you made me do

Oh, oh

By the time you read this, I will have gone the way good men go
When they go bad, where they go bad
By the time you read this, I will have gone to the place where good men go
Where they go wrong, when they go wrong

By the time you read this, I will already have been changed
Do not reply to this, after I've experienced maximum pain
No longer good to anyone, and never would be again
Know that I spent my final days, endlessly tying the endless loose ends

One last look around the place, with sun shining into empty room
For the final time I close the door that will open for someone new

The only change I make before I leave, is in the bedroom of my dreams
Where I covered the walls in deep blue paint, rather than my blood and my brains

By the time you read this, I will already be dead
Do not reply to this, it is only to be read
By the time you read this, I will already be dead


4. I Was Buried In Mount Pleasant Cemetery

I was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, alone and unceremoniously
Buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, when life was taken from me

Our tree was full and green, I had to leave it
The sadness was overwhelming,
To be alone beneath it

The sun came down hot and hard, I could never sleep
To disappear was the only way I could find relief

When I was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, alone and unceremoniously
Buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, when life was taken so suddenly

First I paid my respects to Glenn Gould
Then I visited the grave of Alexander Muir
Next to Eaton's tomb, I hung my head and cried
Looking for Joseph Mulgrew, I gave up and died

When I was buried...

The birds sang, the flowers in bloom, spring had just begun
Recently fitted for a suit, now lying in a box
By summer, I was gone, my remains stolen from the ground
My body never recovered and I was never found
Until now

I was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, alone and unceremoniously

Buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, between the monuments and trees
At the heart of the city, Amongst the statues and fountains
New life could begin, where the old path I ran came to and end

I was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, alone and unceremoniously
Buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, when life was taken from me


5. Into Exile: "Can You Get Here In 10 Days?"

Everyone lives, but not everyone truly dies
While they're still alive and survive
Without anything to lose, I don't care what will happen to me
I climb through this dirty window of opportunity

I feel a change of heart
From the pain of a heartbreaking loss
I hear awful sounds crying out
I feel my heart breaking loose

I cast away at my own will, to mourn alone across the sea
It may never feel good, it may never feel right
But it seemed like a good idea at the time

I don't want praise for going away, it draws attention to my loss
But drink alone for me while I am gone, We'll together again when I come home

I feel my heart breaking away,
From the pain of a heartbreaking loss
I hear the awful howl come ripping from my mouth
I feel my heart breaking loose...

Disconnect and disassociate yourself from everything and everyone you know.
Just let go. Go. Don't look back, and see where it takes you. After a year has passed you might feel good enough to come home, or there's the excitement that you may leave and just stay, and never come home again, either way, you'll be glad you did it. Having left and gone from being able to decide for yourself after you've done your time.
They say that time heals all wounds, well this is a good way to spend that time, what better way to distract yourself from sadness than to fully obligate your crisis to the point where it becomes about survival, making it a total mindfuck about the fact that it's allowing you to erase your memory and deprogram yourself and rebuild somewhere in the abyss.
Surrendering all control and familiarity, boldly going into the unknown, focusing on your voluntary deportation from your own home, you know you have to go, flights are running on time, ask yourself the question "Can you get here in ten days?"
"Yes I can!"

It's time to cross the ocean... and dive, into exile!


6. Pining (For You)

On the other side of night and day
I could be no farther away
The moon I see is not our moon,
This sun is not the one we know
But the are safe with you at home
It's I, who's gone

And I am pining for you,
Reminded of you all the time
I'm always pining, for you

What I thought was so unique about you
Must be common after all
For I am constantly reminded of you everywhere I go
What I thought was so extraordinary, is common after all
As I am constantly pining for you, everywhere I go

You could go anywhere and people would invite you to stay
I could meet anyone else and still feel completely alone
So I try to distract myself and make new discoveries
But as I explore the forests of my Seoul, I see you in the trees

And I am pining for you,
Reminded of you all the time
I'm always pining, for you

What I thought was so unique about you
Must be common after all
For I am constantly reminded of you everywhere I go
What I thought was so extraordinary is common around the world
Men are always pining for their loves, while their loves don't pine for them at all

And I am pining for you, reminded of you in everything I see
I'm always pining, for you
And I am pining for you, reminded of you in everything I see
I'm always pining for you, though I know you don't pine for me

In the land of the rising sun, I dream of the midnight run
In the land of the morning calm, I lie awake until tomorrow's dawn

On the other side of night and day
I could be no farther away
The moon I see is not our moon, This sun is not the one we know


7. Wet Leather

Life is just pain and piss; it's nothing that I will miss
Life is just pain and piss; it's just... temporary
Life is the madness of a drunken city night
With wet leather on your back and rain dripping off your spikes

PAIN! Life is just pain and piss. PISS! It's nothing that I will miss.
PAIN! Life is just pain and piss and everything is a scam

Life is your hopes and dreams, your expectations
When your health is a full-time job, and there's no vacation
Life is the comfort of a good friend's advice
Who says it's all your fault and your standards are too high

PAIN! Life is just pain and piss. PISS! It's nothing that I will miss.
I'm always doing something to hurt myself just trying to feel alive

Life is the impact of a falling brick wall of rain
Coming down on your long walk home when your thoughts are sobering
Life is your consciousness as you tame your wild beasts
When exhaustion is the currency that you must pay for sleep

Life is just pain and piss; it's nothing that I will miss
Life is just pain and piss; it's just... temporary
Life is the madness of a drunken city night


8. Suicide Cargoload (Drag That Weight!)

Drag that fuckin' weight man,
Drag that weight and breathe
Pull that fuckin' anchor across the rocks, push that mountain into the sea

Drag that Weight! Over Foreign Landscapes! Drag that Weight!

Like a 10 ton stone statue, standing before miles of mountains
In a foreign land, where you don't speak the language there

I feel so heavy man... So I drag that weight!
And I drag that weight over foreign landscapes

Slow and heavy!

Drag that fuckin' weight man,
Drag that weight and breathe
Pull that fuckin' anchor across the rocks, push that mountain into the sea


9. Halves And Quarters

A little more today, a little less the next
Halves and quarters are keeping me going
A little less today, a little more the next
Halves and quarters are keeping me going

I'm weaning myself off the one thing that's keeping me alive
I'm weaning myself off the one thing that's helping me to survive
I'm splittin' the pills that aide me with my ills
I'm weaning myself off the one thing one day at a time

A little more today, a little less the next
Halves and quarters are keeping me going
A little less today, a little more the next


10. You Are Here With Me (In This Sequence Of Dreams)

I see you in my sleep
In this sequence of dreams, you are here with me
I see you in my dreams
In this sequence of dreams, you are here with me
In this sequence of dreams, you are with me here

It's unlikely to meet and share a dream, If I'm sleeping while you're awake
But when I think of you for strength, in dreams you reappear
And you are here with me, in this sequence of dreams you are with me here

I see you in my sleep
In this sequence of dreams, you are here with me
I see you in my dreams


11. Retrosleep In The Morning Calm

It's good that I sleep alone... so often
Because I toss and turn so much, I feel bad when I disturb my partner
It's okay that I toss and turn... all night, every night
Because I sleep alone so often, I feel bad when I've disturbed my partner
It's good that I'm alone, because I sleep so much so often
And I sleep so much because I am alone, so often, all the time

It's good that I sleep alone... so often
Because I toss and turn so much, I feel bad when I disturb my partner
It's okay that I toss and turn... all night, every night


12. Don't Open The Wounds / Skywide Armspread

You must grieve your loss, until the grief is gone
But once you've come this far, you can't look back anymore
But whatever you do, don't open the wounds
Whatever you do, don't open the wounds
You must undo the dream, as part of your deprogramming
It's what you force yourself to do when change has been forced upon you

It doesn't help to hurt yourself, late at night and most alone
And don't deprive yourself of light as you try to pass the day time
Yesterdays forecast was totally wrong
And I accept the happiness that didn't come

Hold your head up high and revel in the moment you feared would never come
To be standing skywide armspread on a mountain again

Hold your head up high, again, and revel in the feeling you feared would never return, to be
I'm on a mountain again!

You must grieve your loss, until the grief is gone
But once you've come this far, you can't look back anymore
But whatever you do, don't open the wounds


13. Natural Technologies

The vicious beating, the rapid flow of thinning blood
Pumping fluid that warms the darkness of my heart
The heavy breathing, the strangest desire
The drive of evolution is designed not to be denied

No day is complete without the enjoyment of flesh
For the daily ritual is essential to the rhythm of strength and vitality
Do not deny yourself the pleasures of life
Resistance of nature is a painful way to go
Even the savage beast needs love to thrive
Follow your instincts and let them run wild

We are beasts designed to feel
Rewarded with pleasure, and punished with oh so much pain
Universal, survival of the species is driven by natural technologies

The vicious beating, the rapid flow of thinning blood
Pumping fluid that warms the darkness of my heart
The heavy breathing, the strangest desire


14. Mirror Reflection & The Hammer Reinvention

I was right all along, and I was wrong to believe,
Foolish to doubt the self-respecting truths, I learned while suffering.

Nothing happens for any reason, there is no plan.
We are all just random beings, not destined for anything.

The world is nothing, disguised as something it is not.
Aspire to be something, appearing as you really are.

Dig deep to find your strength, trust that wisdom comes with age.
But when ways of old have been outgrown, don't hesitate to chop them down

Once you've been leveled out, reconnect with yourself again.
When new ideas have led you astray, return yourself to whom you once became.

The world is nothing, disguised as something it is not.
Aspire to be something, appearing as you really are.

Cut yourself down to the stem. Stand upon level ground again.
Tear yourself all the way down and rebuild yourself in solitude.

When left alone, the forests renew themselves.
When left alone, man improves himself, as well.

You always knew, one day you would destroy me.
And I always knew I would have to be the one to restore me.

Your need for self-reflection is a reflection of you and a sign of the times.
Your use of self-expression is a weapon in the age in which we live.

When you hold the hammer, you are the weapon,
Smash the mirror for seven years of self-sacrifice.
When you hold the mirror, you're in reflection,
Reflect the truth and not the curse of superstition.

I thought you were taking pictures of me,
But that was just the lights burning out!
It was no one's dream to follow me,
When everyone wants to be followed themselves.

Your self-expression is a reflection of the mind.
Use it to make peace with yourself,
Those around you and the age in which you live.

Make peace with the age in which you live.

Your need for self-reflection is a reflection of you and a sign of the times.
Your use of self-expression is a weapon in the age in which we live.

When you hold the hammer, you are the weapon,
Smash the mirror for seven years of self-sacrifice.
When you hold the mirror, you're in reflection,
Reflect the truth and not the curse of superstition.

I thought you were taking pictures of me,
But that was just the lights burning out!
It was no one's dream to follow me,
When everyone wants to be followed themselves.

Your self-expression is a weapon of the mind.
Use it to defend yourself, threaten others and enhance your life.

Threaten others and enhance your life.

Your need for self-reflection is a reflection of you and a sign of the times.
Your use of self-expression is a weapon in the age in which we live.

Smash the mirror for seven years of self-sacrifice.

Reflect the truth and not the curse of superstition.

I thought you were taking pictures of me,
But that was just the lights burning out!
It was no one's dream to follow me,
When everyone wants to be followed themselves.


15. Our Union (In Limbo)

Another year, another room, where you hang a few things on the walls.
It's just where you call home for now,
Until it's time to take them down and move on.

Great company, has no where else they need to be,
No place else they'd rather go, and no one waiting for them at home.

Another year, another room, you still don't care to own anything.
You know you won't find what you want, in a place where you don't belong.

I am wanted, wherever there is a need,
For those with no place to go, who need somewhere new to be.

Hope is the room, you make in your heart,
To find a new home for all your misguided love.
Look at the room I've made. I am nearly empty again,
But I want to give to you, and I like it when you take from me.

I still don't care to own anything. I still don't have anything to defend.
But less is more than ever before, in transition again...

Another year, another room, where you hang a few things on the walls.
It's just where you call home for now,
Until it's time to take them down and move on.


16. Move On!

The woman will always leave the man.

You may come together, in the lust of summer,
And she may stay with you, to see the autumn colours,
And love you through the winter, in your warm and cozy home,
But by the time that spring arrives... she'll be gone.

The woman will always leave the man.
Women move on, and men love forever.

Women move one. Men move on. Women move one. Men! Move on!
Men! Move on! Men! Move on! Men! Move on! Men! Move on!

1. Falling Apart

We are almost whole…
We have burned it down – again and again…
Returning to foundation – year after year…
Suffering from neglect and deterioration…
We are almost whole
We have burned it down – again and again
Returning to foundation – year after year
Suffering from neglect and deterioration

Bodies waiting for demolition
Once and for all

We’re taking closure with satisfaction
There could be no turning back
Deny yourself your mixed emotions
You have a job to do, so wipe away your tears
And drive it forward now

I see you falling apart, but I know you’re not worth tearing down
I see you falling apart, but I know you’re not worth tearing down
I see you falling apart, but I know you’re not worth tearing down
I see you falling apart, but I know you’re not worth tearing down

The floor is running out beneath us…
The caving roof was pouring in…
Broken glass lie all around us…
The doors will slam right off their hinges…
The floor is running out beneath us
The caving roof was pouring in
Broken glass lie all around us
The doors will slam right off their hinges

We’re past the point of no return here
Nothing can be salvaged now
So look past your hesitations
You have a job to do, so gather up your strength
And drive it forward now

I see you falling apart, but I know you’re not worth tearing down
I see you falling apart, but I know you’re not worth tearing down
I see you falling apart, but I know you’re not worth tearing down
I see you falling apart, but I know you’re not worth tearing down

I’m afraid to start this
I want to tear you down
But if you leave without this
I’m going to tear it all right down
Right now

We are almost whole… (The floor is running out beneath us…)
We have burned it down – again and again… (The caving roof was pouring in…)
Returning to foundation – year after year… (Broken glass lie all around us…)
Suffering from neglect and deterioration… (The doors will slam right off their hinges…)

2. You Were The Light

Your pretty causes
Make great conversation
While another world is yearning
Painfully for an end

And who will save me now
Now that you are gone
And who will save you from yourself
You were the light
That shone brightly in the night
You were the light
That shone harshly on my life

Think of me when you are weak
Whenever when you are strong
Pretending that I'm OK
Will comfort when you are lost

And who will save me now
Now that you are gone
And who will save you from yourself
You were the light
That shone brightly in the night
You were the light
That shone harshly on my life

Close the door and cry,
Or lock it up from the outside.
Look down on me from the balcony,
And hold the railing tight.

And if you changed your mind
Then you are justified
And if you changed your mind
You'd know that you were right

And you will be just fine

The more you knew
The less you wanted to
You made our decisions on your own
And left me without a choice to choose

None of this
Will ever haunt you now
Since there is no one else
Accounting for your cruelty but me
You will see no consequence
And though I am not to blame
I suffer all the same

And who will save me now
Now that you are gone (now that you are gone)
And who will save you from yourself
You were the light
That shone brightly in the night
You were the light
That shone harshly on my life
You were the light
That flash and left me in the dark
You were the light
The only light I'll ever know
You were the light
You were the light
You were the light
You were the light

1. Lightning & Snow

There was a flash of lightning, Followed by snow
In a moment of silence (for myself), After a shock to the soul

With a look of disbelief, Alone and numb to the cold
I knew the last moment had passed, Before enduring years of sorrow

There was a crack of electric light, coming down from a darkened sky
My dreams flashed before my eyes, as they were erased from my life.  

There was a flash of lightning, Followed by snow
Twas just the moment of change, Before years of sorrow

The shock and awe, the fright and woe
I only had one life to live, and life said no.

The loss of love, has left me hollow
All bliss twists into pain, Where there was joy, years of grief have followed!

There was a flash of lightning, followed by snow
It struck my heart, only once...which made me want it more

The emptiness it left in me, will always need to be filled
For it will be there all the time, from now on, forever more.  

There was a crack of electric light, coming down from a darkened sky
My dreams flashed before my eyes, AS they were erased from my life.  

There was a flash of lightning, Followed by snow
Twas just a moment of pain, Before years of sorrow

The shock and awe, the fright and woe
And when I asked for a second chance, life said no.


2. Death Is Not An Exit

The bleak life and modern times
Of grey skies and electric light

Life... life... So life is precious, after all
Respect the body, for it is all you really are
Life... life... So life is precious after all
Protect the body, for it is all that keeps you on

We are confined to the nature of reality
Where the failure of our system will be the end of our dream
Between the fields of darkness, before and after we exist
Earth is a spiritual place but there is nothing after this.

We were nothing for a billion years before our time
And we will be nothing more again for an eternity yet to come

Whoa! Death is not an exit (death is the flick of the switch)
Whoa! Death is not an exit (death is the flick of the off switch)

The bleak life and modern times...
Of grey skies and electric light
In the bleak life and modern times...
Of grey skies and electric light


3. Keeper Of The Ledger

It is a fair and noble arrangement
This business of life and existence
Where everything we take from the earth
Will be taken back and returned

The face of god has always been disguised
As the mother / giver of all life
But the keeper of the ledger for the cult of nature
Only concerns that your body returns on time

Return to the earth, Pay the price for your existence
Into the hand of earths domain,
For there is balance to be maintained

The count is cold and calculated, The precision is exact
No one is exempt or unaccounted for,
All that was taken will be taken back.

The gods have always been believed to love,
And care for the quality of our lives
But the keeper of the ledger for the cult of nature
Only concerns with the quantity of your time

We create our myths and purpose,
To fill our lives with hope and wonder
But to the keeper of the ledger for the cult of nature
Your body is just...a(nother) number.

It is a fair assumption, of our human nature to assume...
That the business of nature... is inherently good

(When) Nature comes collecting, It doesn't care at all about you
Nature comes collecting, It doesn't care at all to know you
(When) Nature comes collecting, It doesn't care to hear your story
Nature comes collecting, and only wants you for your body

Nature is the man (after all), Nature is the mob (after all)
Nature is the business (after all), Nature is the cult


4. Travelling Alone

When I look around you I understand why you believe
I see your evidence of God, all around me

You have so therefore you are  But I have not.  
You've seen the evidence of God in your life, but I have none.

When I was questioned, I shook my head and starred
I was traveling alone, and had nothing to declare

He asked how I knew for sure
And would I tell everyone I knew
If it would hurt to know the truth

I can be thankful to be alive but I despise this life. 
in all my years, at best, have only learned just to survive.

But When I look around you I understand why you believe
I see your evidence of God, all around me

You have so therefore you are  But I have not.  
You've seen the evidence of God but I have not and I have none

(When he asked me,) I shook my head and laughed
I never had a taste for life 
and I felt there was no turning back

Would I try to take away their hope?
Replace it with reality / and offer them reality
Exchange their joy with my bleak view
And leave them miserable like me?

I have searched and I have tried to find a place where   I can be
I love my homeland dearly but never carved a place in society

But When I look around you I understand why you believe
I see your evidence of God, all around me

You have so therefore you are, but I have not
You are too rich for hate, and I am too poor to love.

When I asked him, he shook his head and stared
â€œI see no evidence of God, in the men from the west


5. Adora Vivos

A moment of silence... but not one moment more
The dead are to be forgotten, we are here to be...adored 

Look me, in the eyes, don't believe a word they say
For life is good, life is glory, though we live, one life only
Tell me, in real time, don't hesitate to profess
Love me, in the flesh, don't wait ˜till death to sing my praise

A moment of silence... but not one moment more
The dead are to be forgotten, we are here to be adored 
IN the bleak life and modern times, Under grey skies and electric light
Mortal men are living gods, More real than any God ever was

Adora Vivos - Our people are civilized...  Love the living while they're still alive 
Adora Vivos - Our people are civilized...  we shouldn't worship the dead.

In The bleak life and modern times, Under grey skies and electric light
Where the living still walk the earth alone, more real than any God ever was

In bleak life, (We are realer than gods!)  - More real than any God ever was
In modern times (we are realer than Gods!) - More real than any God ever was
Under grey skies and electric light, we the living still walk the earth alone
Where mortal men are living gods, more real than any God...ever was.  

A moment of silence, (for the dead) but not one moment more
They've all gone to be forgotten, were still here, to be adored

Look me, in the face, and don't believe a word I say
This life is hard, this life is lonely, and we are here, for one night only
See the pain, in my eyes, the defeat, of my age
Feel the urgency of time, and don't wait 'till death to sing my praise

A moment of silence (for the dead), but not one moment more
The dead are to be forgotten, we are here to be adored
If you're waiting for tomorrow, save yourself for another day
But if you're living in the moment, don't wait ('till death) to sing my praise

In The bleak life and modern times, Under grey skies and electric light
Mortal men are living Gods, More real than any God ever was


6. Silver

Come when you need me, leave me when you need to be free
Come when you want me, leave me when you need me to understand
Did you fall out of love, because you fell in love again?
Did you fall out of love, because you fell in love, with someone new? 

When the new love, shined with all the promise of all I couldn't give to you.
And the new life offered all you wanted, and you had to choose

I helped to carry you, I took good care of you, I wanted us to continue
But I knew, that you would leave, when the time was right for you.

Life was a relay I passed it off to you.  You ran away, and won the race
You never looked back, to see what happened to me, For I was only second place

When the new love, shined with all the promise of all I couldn't give to you.
And the new life offered all you wanted, and you were asked to choose.

We come together to share your sorrows - where you save yourself for someone else. 
You keep your distance in times of hope, while I cry (for you) all by myself

When you're silver, you never come first, When you're silver, the truth always hurts.

I don't want unconditional love, I'll always need to be judged
I don't want a traditional love, I'll always need to be wanted/loved by someone else

When did the city make you so cold?
We share your sorrows but I dine alone...
When did the city make you so cold?  
I cry alone - while you dine with someone else

When did the city make you so cold?
We cry together but I dine alone...
When did the city make you so cold?
We share your sorrows but I dine alone... I always dine alone...


7. Career Suicide (Is Not Real Suicide)

We were born to live, in a desperate time
Where it seems the death of dreams, is the end of life

But we have only one life to live, just one opportunity
And failure is not the end of the world, that's just society!

Career suicide is not real suicide, Career suicide is alright
Career suicide is not real suicide, Career suicide is fine

We are all expendable, and we can be replaced.
They have supplies of infinite lives, and no time to waste.  

But we have only one life to live, one time to exist
And though there is no afterlife (after all), there is still more to life than this!

Career suicide is not real suicide, Career suicide is alright
Career suicide is not real suicide, Career suicide is fine
Career suicide is not real suicide its not real suicide at all... 
Career suicide is not real suicide, its not the end of the world... 

Death is the failure of our parts,
Failure is just the death of dreams
There's more to life than suc-cess
but only death is real... 

ONLY DEATH IS REAL!

Death is the failure of our parts,
Failure is just the death of dreams
There's more to life than suc-cess
but only death is real... 

Career suicide is not real suicide, Career suicide is alright
Career suicide is not real suicide, Career suicide is fine
Career suicide is not real suicide its not real suicide at all... 
Career suicide is not real suicide, its not the end of the world...its not the end of the world.


8. Modern Life Architecture

When weâ€™re young, we design a plan, we work, we build, we make it real
and in the moment it becomes complete, The first cracks start to appear

A weak foundation, finally revealed
in the desperation, when the walls came tumbling down

Oh, In my prime - Oh, never to return
Oh, as I once was - A broken man, Living half a life... (without you...)

On the path to recovery, As a sign of the times, with the empires crumbling
I left all dreams abandoned, On the steps of a modern life

In defeat we redesign the plan, and we give it just one more chance
As we take another deep breath, and prepare for the worst, again 

A life in crisis, is always threatened by time
For the longer it takes to be restored... 
the less likely it is to occur.  

Oh, In my prime - Oh, never to return
Oh, as I once was- A broken man, Living all alone... (without you...)

On the path to recovery, with the empires crumbling
I left all dreams abandoned, On the steps of a modern life

On the path to recovery, with the empires crumbling
I left all dreams abandoned with you, On the steps of a modern life

There is always hope, of course, that one day, we will rise again
but this modern life architecture, Is crumbling, under the weight of the world


9. Kiss My Ashes (Goodbye)

To mourn the end is to say goodbye
Not To yearn for that which we will never have again

We cry for our life together - because we know it will end
And we try to understand, how we could ever love again

Save your tears, at the end of our time...
We've cried enough in our lives, at the end of our time, just kiss my ashes goodbye

We miss them so much now that they are gone
Took them for granted for living, so long

We read their words again, and we listen to them again 
as we start to understand, what they were trying to say, all along

Ohhhh, save your tears,
At the end of our time, kiss my ashes goodbye. 

Whoa!  Kiss my ashes goodbye.


10. Kiss My Ashes (Goodbye)

Curse all those who were so vain 
who felt entitled to hold a place on the earth as a grave for their remains
but no monument for me, please... I am not one of them
I didn't need it in life, I wont need it in death

Whoa, just kiss my ashes goodbye
Whoa, when I die...kiss my ashes goodbye

When words become irrelevant, 
and you start to feel as though ...you've been misled
Keep me out of sight, leave me out of mind...
when the thought no longer serves you
when I no longer serve you, just let the memories die (...and move on)

Whoa, kiss my ashes goodbye
Whoa, when I die...kiss my ashes goodbye


11. Finality

When we have all gone, to the silence of eternity... 
To first be forgotten, and lost in, the records of the earth
Could I still miss you, then, in the time and space after life
When no one is searching anymore, and where we are nowhere to be found 

We didn't spend our life together
and I will miss you forever

The choice was mine, To long for a time, that will never come
Though we leave the world apart, I, still went peacefully, quietly, 
with you, still, firmly... in my heart.

I will wait forever.  I wait...


12. Alternate Ending

In the darkness, under the stars, With enough warning, to pull off to the side, in time

In the end, was there anyone to share in your joy?
I woke up one day...and realized it was already over

Back On the highway, under the moon, my final moments, still wondering about you...

In the end, was there anyone to share in your joy?
I woke up for years without you, to realize it was already over, for me 

Now making amendments... to the dream / story...
Changing the ending, as I would like it, to be

We were together, in a memory
And We live forever, in finality.

Holding on...To a dream... 
When the end... couldn't come slow enough for me. 

Holding on...

1. Eon

2. Thulcandra

Despair, torn by hate,
DISTORTED ATMOSPHERE
Alas, observing the inconvenient horizon
Prepare to launch all terrestrial
imprudence, until nothing remains;
COMPLETE THE IMMOLATION

THULCANDRA PROVIDES!
THULCANDRA PROFANES!

Abstract emotion, major impropriety
philanthropic tendencies concretely oppressed!

IMPORTUNATED PROPHECIES
EXTERMINATING AMNESTIES
DECAYING IMMORTALLY
FREEDOM IN OUR DEATH!

SOLUTION!!!

For England and the monarchy
we free our souls; our destiny
Though it is implied tratory
TO THE ENTIRE EARTH HUMANITY


3. Archipelago

One by one, they fell into the sea
The gleam extinguished; arduous future wait for me
Gravity; the deep pulls me under
Darkness fills me, and I gurgle as is sink

THE CLOUDS ABOVE ARE DARK, I CAN FEEL IT!
AS ARCHIPELAGO WANTS TO SWALLOW ME
MY BLOODSHOT EYEBALLS; MY PRESSURED LUNGS
MY LIFE; MY LIFE IS IT SLOWLY FADING!?

CONATION COMES IN WAVES; THEY TAKE YOU TO THE SHORE

RISE!
RISE!!
RISE!!!

1. Cromlech

Into the abyss i fall
And Dark is the Reich of the dead
A portal to reach to the side
Where bodies fall from the sky
Solitude And Peace Of Mind
Entombed In Cromlech
Yes, flee over the River Styx
and join the dead with joy
An ocean of Blasphemy
Heathenish realm
and "Do What Thou Wilt" as decoy
My Prophecy is true...
We'll All Make It Through


2. Sunrise Over Locus Mortis

The dark and cold wastelands of
Grey dust softens when my down turned
triangular teardrops covers the ground
This secret got lost to the shepherd's flock
My burning skin connects with the sands of time
and thus the holy angels appear...
"Drag THEM through the mud" I cried
"Instead of me"
"This is not the death I choose -
your Christian trials are wrong!"
I speak of what I want
And my heart lies therein
Blackened you say -
Then black is my way
And call me an Enemy -
I shall only stand proud
Awaiting the rise of the DarkSide
Surise Over Locus Mortis


3. Soulside Journey

I have had this Vision
of a voyage in mind and soul
Through silent Somniferous scenes
within the enclosed chambers of my
untouched spiritual experiences
Soaring through damp air, Seeing
faces, twisting, plunging through my colour
Cosmic Fear arrives, I hold a dead one,
Surrounded by my many candles
(I burn to cleanse the air)
Rotten Unclean Sacrifice Nightmares
Unreal Psychedelic Journey
Ride The Darkside
Search The Soulside


4. Accumulation of Generalization

Enter to realm of Satan


5. Neptune Towers

Landscapes of frozen methane
Vast fields of blue dust before my eyes
I was sent here to describe and tease
the minds of the fantasy kings (of my homeland)
On a ship of curiosity I sail
((oh) what treasure can be found here!)
And why must eyes face this
Unearthly show of morbid climate
Behind the Neptune hillsides
They say the towers stand tall
Built by hands dissimiliar to mine
And Brought alive
by hearts of ancient alien cultures


6. Sempiternal Sepulchrality

Oh, once again, I kneel before this altar
Out in the moist chilly forest I proclaim
The Autumn leaves that fell
And those who still attach the trees
The Breeze that blew my hair
The one I've known through all these years...
The songs I never forgot -
A past that is now Lost....


7. Grave With A View

I am allergic to my own tongue
Licking my wounds, end up in Tears
I sweep my teeth in yellow Spit
Rotting Christ before my eyes
I spit in the mouth of the priest -
Revenge for Those Who Died
So what if I am fuckin' insane
I'll fucking kill you anyway!
My very heart blows out of my fucking chest
And the beams go wild against the brown, brown wall
I hope they give me
A Grave With A View...


8. Iconoclasm Sweeps Cappadocia

Burn the crucifix.
Cremate the soul of the Virginborn
Freeze the shadow of ashes and let
it float away by the Thunder listener's
intense eyelash movements under their
concentration to open the cosmic lid
Crush not only our surrounding walls
of curiosity, but also the hordes
of Blind Believers.


9. Nor The Silent Whispers

The Open Road,
like a blue horizon
And you could see for Miles
So we could submerge right here
And we should bring our hearts there...
Top of the White trees
would mean nothing to us
Nor the silent whispers
from the souls of glass


10. The Watchtower

Nocturnal flight, no shadows cast
a distant symbol of our beyond
life lies in front of us
Sacred Ground, Rotten Earth
Ashes To Dust
Flesh Decomposed
Caressing the sacred ground
where the deadened corpses lie
A sepulchural misty night
with a whiff of the Macabre
Silently watching the stones
put there as a symbol of death
Our minds united; A force is lit,
and insight creates
A humanoid watchtower, reaching for
their souls to the Sky
For a glance onto
The Other Side....

1. Kathaarian Life Code

Desert... Night...
Coyotes Feel the Cold Wave of The Dark
Red Eyes eats through
the Vast Nocturnal Landscape
A Strong Light - The Only Night

This is where he made Sculptures
from the Visions that Created The Force

Baphomet in Steel
For the Flesh of Cain
A Throne made by remains
of 12 holy Disciples

New Disciples rose,
one by one, ten by ten
All met under the Desert Moonlight
Knowledge fired across the Landscape
Sparks that mixed with Coyote Eyes
Diabolic Forces in a Ceremonial Union

And each Beast of the Land
took its own way in Living
(the) Seven forbidden things
were Eternally Desecrated

Kathaaria was Built - World without End


2. In The Shadow Of The Horns

Face of the Goat in the Mirror
Eyes Burn like (an) October Sunrise
As Once they Gazed upon the Hillside
Searching for the Memories...

In the Shadow of the Horns
only seen by the Kings
of the Dawn (of the) First Millennium
upon the Thrones

In the Shadow of the Horns
Cleansed like the air in the Night
World Without End

(we've become) a Race of the Cursed Seeds
for five United Forces
in the Eternal Dawn
the Kings that held (their) heads high

The Triumph of chaos - Has Guided our Path
we Circles the holy Sinai - Our Swords Gave Wings
Invisible force of our Abyssic Hate
Our seeds Boil as we gaze upon the New Millennium

Weeping by the Graves of the Glorious Ones
(so) the hardened Frost Melts Away
Clouds Gather across a Freezing Moon
I kiss the Goat - Witchcraft Still Breathes


3. Paragon Belial

I lay Enshrined
Contaminated Time Warp
My Flesh Yearns
For the Tombworld

My soul like layers of Frost
Simulating a Spectre Shadow
Frozen in Time and Space
I was Hacked out of Ice

Faded am I, behind a wall of consciousness
Still feeling a different World
Surrounding Me
Chilling Voices fill my head -
I Open My Eyes;

The Boiling Sea Beneath
The Castle of Faust
Belial finally Comes Forth:

"The Ancient White light writings
were just lying men and their Pens
You are the same, only in Black.
Return with the knowledge
of making your own god"

Dreamking of the Tombworld:
I Enter Into an Eternal Oath
Creating my Paragon Belial


4. Where Cold Winds Blow

Where Cold Wings Blow I (was) laid to Rest
I Can not reach my Rusty Weapons
the Blood and Sword that Guided my Path
for they Drowned in the Sands of Wisdom

I was, indeed, a King of the Flesh
My Blackened Edges; still they were Sharp
Honoured by the Carnal Herds
but asketh thou: Closed are the Gates?

My Mind cut my Winged Weapons
and Teeth that was my Pride
And from the Forest all would hear:
"Wisdom Opens the Gate for the King"

My Weapons Sighted - My Tears they Tasted
Summon my Warriors - To the Land of Desire
To the Domain of Hate - Where Cold Winds Blew
For Lust for Hell - We Rode with the North Wind

Only I could accomplish a fucken Self-deceit
There are only Two Paths - the Mind or the Sword
And the Mind was Open like the Sights in a Dream
But the Sword was like a Stone around my neck

I Entered the Soul of the Snake
and Slept with the Armageddish Whore
(but) without my Throne and my Weapons;
Where Cold Winds Blow became my Grave


5. A Blaze In The Northern Sky

Hear a Haunting Chant
Lying in the Northern wind
As the Sky turns Black
clouds of Melancholy
rape the Beams
of a Devoid Dying Sun
and the Distant Fog approaches

Coven of forgotten Delight
Hear the Pride of a Northern Storm
Triumphant sight on a Northern Sky

Where the days are Dark
and Night the Same
Moonlight Drank the Blood
of a thousand Pagan men

It took ten times a hundred Years
Before the King on the Northern Throne
was brought Tales of the crucified one

Coven of renewed Delight;
A Thousand Years have passed since then -
Years of Lost Pride and Lust

Souls of Blasphemy,
hear a Haunting Chant -

We are a Blaze in the Northern Sky
The next thousand Years Are OURS


6. The Pagan Winter

Horned Master of Endless Time
Summon thy Unholy Disciples
Trained for Centuries to Come.
Gather on the highest Mountain
United by Hatred;
The final Superjoint Ritual...

This, The Pagan Winter
Kept for the Obscure (ones)
Candles hold the only light
Sextons hide in Fear

For this Eternal Winter
A New God Ruled the Sky
The Million Hands Of Joy
Have something holy to Burn

From the top of the World one could see
The white light Servants Flee
Engulfed in an Infernal Cyclone
Created by (our) Blasphemy

Religious bodies Crossed the Sky
the Vision was our Wine
Roar of Fire, Feeble Fools
Into The Furnace Fire

1. Natassja In Eternal Sleep

Alcohol is in my veins...
Tears fall as I think of you.
The true memory you left me with
is a key to the wine of melancholy.

I drown myself in the deepest of sorrows-
As you Burned on that stake they burnt
my soul as well.
Your pure feelings, your flaming hate;
it was not enough.

Natassja, my beloved satanic witch,
The power in your eyes and yourself.
Worked for the noble in man.
Pass the bottle, pass the knife,
Pass me your unholy crafts.

I shall never forget you, the best
of all there is, I lick your cold lips,
I embrace your coffin as I sigh in woe.
You never kissed the priest, you never
Drank the blood of jesus. Weird, they say -
well, turn it upside down like you did,
and they kill, kill, and they take you away...

Now, centuries later, I do yours and my sign.
You live in me, like you moved in with my soul.
Your resurrection is the spirit of you -
Installed in me. So now, your thougths
and your pains are my wine; and Natassja:
I'll get these goddam angels drunk...


2. Summer Of The Diabolical Holocaust

Come the raging chaos, rule power from your soul
Pure demoniac blessing as I kill myself in woe
Alls souls coloured the face of the moon
Shall suffer the eclipse

You must know that I can no longer see
The difference of dreams and reality
For the walls have been sieged
And conquered by our

Dark satanic blasphemy

I stand alone in a valley filled with starlight
My eyes suffer from eternal sparks
So shut the light and dream so I can see
The trident clearer than ever now

And in my darkest fantasy
And as I reach for hell
I am free...

Hearers are raising from the open sky
Meglomania reigns supreme
Chilled in horror - Christian death
They learned how long to stand and pull

I head to receive
The lust and pain
Beat me Jesus
And we will win


3. The Dance Of Eternal Shadows

I must embrace visual hell
To satisfy us
Rape the whores in blasphemy
I am man while I feast upon your flesh

Glance in my eyes
and see the eternal shadows dancing
Playing in the desert of my life
Burning -
And my soul is descending...

Leader of all - face the apocalyps
You fools deep under the black rain
And nothing remains

Flowers to step on, flowers to burn

Am I ready for the god below
Red flesh to penetrate my skin
To send my soul away
To the grave I work
Until I'm feeling weak...

But there's fire
In my heart, in my eyes
In his body, in his eyes
And in his lonely kingdom


4. Unholy Black Metal

When the sun has died
When the angels are blind
When the fog lies thick
Over the Palace of god

When the fullmoon lights the earth
When the wolves gather in the open
When blood rains from the heaven high
And from the pearly gates

When Jehovas hordes are slaughtered
When disciples twelve are dead
When beliefs of easter land
Are raped and raped again

When the whore of Babylon rides
When pity turns to hate
When all sons of Satan
Sodomise the lambs of Christ

When the gates have all been opened
When the funerals never end
When Satan's power paint our hearts
And satisfies our souls

When witches burn the priests
When the Ancient Ones return
When demons ride the nuns
With their horns of dark desire


5. To Walk The Infernal Fields

From the abode of demons
A wing of the pentagram
Comes the juice that painted
My heart and my soul

Swept in black they are
Swept in black I am

From this soul comes the eyes
That will look upon your ten
Beautiful heads with delight

My heart is the one
That will tend to your flames
And make them mine
We share this spirit -
My heart is yours...

I am your disciple
And therefore my own
Your weapon I will be
With the demons that posesses me
We'll ride the seven sins of death
That takes me to Katharian

The sign of your horns
Is my dearest vision
They impale all holy and weak

You watch me face the mirror
And see desecration
With my art I am the fist
In the face of god


6. Under A Funeral Moon

On the day of my final sacrifice
The chilling steel open my veins
Blood staines my skin
Silver chalice must be filled

Drinking the poisoned blood
I enter my shadowed coffin
Two goathorns in my hands
I raise my arms and close my eyes
To receive the infernal hails
From my brother in the land of the damned

The howling wind blows in the naked trees
Moonlit fields are glowing in the dark
Below me, the path to the cemetary
Where my spiritual brothers take me

They halt at the shadows of an oak
My nocturnal funeral commence
Lying in my blasphemous sleep
I am lowered down to the pit

A raven sings my last song
As the wolves howl their goodbyes
The funeral moon glows strongly now
For I am nearly there

This night of late october
The darkside open it's gate
Morbid souls wait for me
- For satanic conspiracy

Flowers of doom
Rising in bloom
You will see
Our immortality!

8. Crossing The Triangle Of Flames

Engulfed in frost
I sailed our dreams
Gloomy inner landscape comes to life

I am the wolf in the darkest scene
Phantasm sweep my role
I am lucifer, I bring you light and pride

Three steps for the white
A journey for the black
No flags for the ten lines
(but) I'll shoot you full of signs

In other dimensions
My visions grew black wings
You wouldn't know if I was him

The dragon rises before me
I'll fornicate the beast
Possess me as I burn
Into your painted realms

7. As Flittermice As Satans Spys

Flittermice of Eld Unveiled at the plenilune
Fordone by Mournful rest now seeking to be fed again
Rising terrestrial power umbraged by celestial light
That Shineth Forth from the palace of god - the palace of no return

Flittermice of Eld they peer into the morrows,
They peer the yesteryears as thoose are coming back.
Beholding the son recrucified, beholding gods race browbeaten,
Beholding the Devastation of all morals built by them.

Flittermice of Eld they fly to blaspheme yehova
and to build their Temple (of the) Damned on once holy pleasure ground
A Fare to Raise the Flag (of Satan), to desseminate the races,
To build the Hall of Battle and to live in Eternal Strife

Flittermice came forth from the land beyond the forest
Multifarious Winged Black Creatures slew the angels (up so) high.
Devastation, Blasphemy, Desecration, Unholy He
who Burned the face of god with the Eye of Our Master

1. Transilvanian Hunger

Transilvanian Hunger...cold..soul
Your hands are cruel...to haunt..to haunt

the mountains are cold...soul...soul...
careful..pale...forever at Night

Take me...can't you feel the Call
Embrace Me Eternally in your daylight slumber

To be Draped by the Shadow of your Morbid Palace
oh, Hate Living...The only heat is warm blood

So Pure... So Cold
Transilvanian Hunger

Hail to the True, intense vampires
A story made for Divine fulfillment

To be the ones breathing a Wind of Sorrow
Sorrow and fright the dearest catharsis

Beautiful Evil Self to be the Morbid Count
A part of a Pact that is delightfully immortal

Feel the call freeze you with the uppermost desire
Transilvanian Hunger...my mountain is cold

So Pure... Evil, Cold
Transilvanian Hunger

2. Triumphant Gleam

Bearer of Sword
Stands beyond (the) Triumphant
As Eternal Night falls
On the Planet of (almost full) Void

Weaves War with a gesture of Might
Fallen are the Souls
Blinded by the Warrior Dreams
Finds the star invisible
To most of the regular Men and Slaves

And The Master serves Him

Leaves then for the Last Time
Finally His Castle
Monument of Misanthropy and Wrath
Hate
Loyal Friend of His Sober Hours
Treads on while the Faith Whips Sharp
Mental pain makes His Eyes Gleam
A light made of Dark Thrones and Frozen Winds
Now can leave the planet

3. The Hordes Of Nebulah

Scent of (the) Flying Shadows
Are in the Eyes of the Vast Uranus
For these Eyes have seen
The horses of the Universe fade away

Oh, Father (the) Fog of Nebula
Your faithful children have escaped
The Walls of Eternity
The Elders Curse-
Like Snow of the Solstice of the Sun

And what the Eyes of Uranus can see
Far Yonder in the Shade of the Walls
Was happening Millenniums ago
So whatever lies Beyond the Gate
It lies in the Past

Oh, We are the Hordes of Nebula
Having Travelled through an Eternal Sea of Void
We glance upon a distant light
Star in the Far; Ye Mighty Sun
Will you Die before We reach you?
Are you a Fatal result of the Laws of Distance?
The Swords of Time are pointing at our Hearts
The grass here seems Raped-
As we face Eternal Misery

4. Hans Siste Vinter

One man went to make a fire
His heart was burning, wild was his soul
In a battle where the father was forgotten, it became his lang, cold last winter

A great warrior, with a strangled mind
He was led into a foggy valley
From his Aryan palace
It is his last, long, cold last winter

Whitechrist and Jews are now celebrating
They thought that Odin would perish
But the battle has now begun
It is his last big honourable victory

5. Beholding The Throne Of The Might

When Hell Calls Your Name
There's No Way Back
And the Burning slaves
And the Burning holy
Will be seen from afar
As the New Risen Throne (Star)
And when the fires have Burned
Beholding the Seas of Ashes
And roll the (ir) Blooded flesh
On holy areas Now Cold
And Dead
And flowers Smell of Black
Now Emperor of No Light
And Pain
For the Eternal slaves
The envy of losers so indeed upon losers themselves
And destruction upon the holy man
Who hails a
Join us We Are (the) Future Now
Be Desecration Master
Be The Hammer
The Hammer

6. Quintessence

Eight miles deep the well forgotten by mortals
Oh, I drank it empty in one single sip
Eight miles wide the valley beyond all hope
Oh, I filled the whole with one single fist

Five million Christians on a ride towards us
Oh, I slaughtered the bunch with one single hit (with my spear)
Five million women so alone in the night
Oh, I had them all satisfied profusely (every night by myself)

Ten thousand trolls hard as rock cold as ice
Oh, they ran when I rose to face them
Ten hungry waves they swallowed my ship
Oh, I steadily walked home (and I only got wet on my feet)

No single book were beholden by me
Oh, no question I cannot do answer
Only one single lamp do show me this way
And that is the eye of Satan

1. Rex

Engulfed in frost
I sailed our dreams
Gloomy inner landscapes come to life

I am the wolf in the darkest scene
Phantasms sweep my role
I am Lucifer, I bring you light and pride

Three steps for the white
A journey for the black
No flags for the tens lines
(but) I'll shoot you full of signs

In other dimensions
My visions grew black wings


2. Pure Demoniac Blessing

The dragon rises before me
I'll fornicate the beast
Come to me
Possess me as I burn
Into your painted realms

Come raging chaos
Rule power from your soul
Pure demoniac blessing
As I kill myself in woe
(As I kill myself in woe)

As souls coloured the face of the moon
Shall suffer the eclipse

You must know that I can no longer see
The difference of dream and reality

For the walls have been sieged
And banished by our Dark Satanic Blasphemy


3. (The) Grimness Of Which Shepherds Mourn

I stand alone
In a valley filled with starlight
My eyes suffer
From eternal sparks

So shut the lids and dream so I can see
The trident clearer than ever now

And in my darkest fantasy
And as I reach for Hell
In my darkest fantasy
I reach for Hell
And I am Free...


4. Sadomasochistic Rites

Hearses are raining
From the open sky
Megolomania
Reigns supreme

Chilled in horror - Christian Death

They leaned too long to stand a fall

I bend to receive
The lust and pain
Beat me Jesus
And we will win


5. As Desertshadows

I must embrace visual hell to satisfy us
Rape the Whores in Blasphemy
I am Him while I feast upon your flesh

Glance into my eyes
And see the darkest shadows dancing
Playing in the desert of my life
Burning, - and my soul is descending

Glance into my eyes
And see the darkest shadows dancing
Into the night


6. In His Lovely Kingdom

Lover of all
Face the Apocolypse
You fade away under the black rain
And flowers remain

Flowers to step on
Flowers to burn

Am I ready for the god below
Red flesh to penetrate my skin
To steel my soul away
To the grave I seek
Until I'm feeling weak

But there's fire
In my heart, in my eyes
In his body, in his eyes
And in his lovely kingdom


7. Black Daemon

Daimon
It's been years
Daimon
Since I discovered the other world
The other world
Where shadows draped to our feet

Evil
Possess me

I pretend
But daemons
I can only
Dream of

In coldness and darkness
I know I'm possessed

Bodies
Are what we all see
Dead or alive

We're alive
But our truth is dead

Invisible
For all to see

Demon
When it's cold and dark
Possess me

More and more


8. Toward(s) The Thornfields

Now
Now that I'm through with you

My black wings have gone

But remember
When you smile
You forget the pain inside

The feeling you all hate
I'm there to bring it
In another world

Have you ever been true
That's what you know I have

You feel I hurt
You feel that I have

Take me to the thornfields


9. (Birth Of Evil) Virgin Sin

I gave birth
To my astral

Upon this earth

Don't you ever walk my way
I walk alone


10. Green Cave Float

I am the fountainstorm from a black heart
I am the desert of redemption
I soar on dead wings of sin
I am pre-nun (with a) cracked virginity

The arrows of moderation failed to hit me
But the ones who came with fear and hate
Kissed me deep long and hard
And those who spelled DEATH are so ready

Paler skin than the sheets of Jewish fairytales
Is sown upon every soul and body of life
And I wonder who sees desolation
Through my eyes, holds the vision
And makes "love" to it

1. Earth's Last Picture

We sail the seas, of negativity
to banish kindness from this place
(Sans scruples, sans humility)

To behold the fierceness of wolves
assailing ye saints thoroughly
(Sans love, sans compassion)

To behold the wails of thine in affright
whilst evil preyeth upon thy hearts
(Sans warmth, sans pity)

To behold a world, darkly astir
rising in madness and mystery
(sans light, sans life)

Would ye not rather fall into pleasant reverie
Than to tremble amidst, this old memory?
Alas for the damned thou art...now ye behold!
Tis the rise of satanic divinity...

Oh we rejoice at the destruction
of all ye have ever lived for...

Hark! as lands tremble, and empires fall
Ye may hear us laugh with sardonic wrath
(tis the voices from the past)

Aye we can not mourn, for
never morrow shall dawn
World without end...


2. Blackwinged

The urge...so strong
To do the devil's work.
The flock of jesus christ
I will rape your souls
till you see the devil clear

Blackwinged

Evil wings bring torture from the skies
With a limb so huge,
to serve you christian sluts
Penetrate your pure cunts with might
Now you filthy cunts, do you see the moon?
Its glowing for the black wings return

Blackwinged

We'll burn your worthless bodies
and send the fire and stench
to heaven high, Remind your worthless
god, that our victory is complete
Clean this earth of holy bitches
Desecrate mother mary

Blackwinged


3. Gather For Attack On The Pearly Gates

Brothers of north, brothers of doom
Ravens has spoke. The attack must begin

The shadows of our warrior souls
will float with infernal speed

Souls of christ, prepare for fight
We'll crush your halls with bonecrushing
might supreme

Your feeble cries will not be heard
Since your god lies dead and buried
In the ruins of the pearly gates

Brothers of north, brothers of doom

Endlessnights of total war
Coming closer
Gather, Hell is calling...gather
Gather for attack on the pearly gates.


4. Black Victory Of Death

Fire
Fire I greet Thee
Give life to shadows grim
So that they may writhe where you dwelt
In life, now dead within

Gaia!
Once mother of all life
Now raped by death
To breed the brethren of black fire

Destruction!
In claw-controe
Neverending bleakness
In the sight of the undead

Black desert of ashes
Under a dark clouded sky
Given shelter to flesheating flames
Starved since creation

Reign from skeleton thrones
The realm of the beast
Black victory of death
No life in this funeral beast


5. Majestic Desolate Eye

Desolate winter lifeless
Landscape
Halls of north frozen
Eagles and ravens domain

One-eyed master silently
Awaits to strike at dawn

Hordes will fight and come
forth from dark hidden places
Ready to kill

March to war, for the eternal
Northern Sky


6. Blasphemer

In the quest for shudders I was as the absence
melted in my hand
As clear as my gleaming sorrow

A spectral fascination
For irony to serve
are the glorious those who triumph
in a kingdom of eternity?
...a castle of sand
whose roof has sheltered my
I sense "the absence of triumph and lust
abruptly rising to cover the glory in sand"

A whore gave birth to the flies
...who flew away with my beauty
A virgin gave birth to my masks

I simulate the absence
"To enter a kingdom of
flesh - a ghastly worn shadow
A fiery picture of poet in hel"

Forlorn I was as poets should be
I am as chosen as the weaver himself.

8. The Serpents Harvest

Feel the burning flame
as the sun in the desert sand
Sense tghe grief as the knives of torment
Shreds your soul
Behold the harvest storm of spiritual rape
Hordes from infernal wastelands united
Under blackened wings
Souls under the serpents banner
with common flesh
But a heart of scorn and painfull anger

Orgy of destruction - a "gesture of might"
Gaze at the grey sky - hatred and poison

And from the vast towers of the underworld
one could see shadows of Them in dark
caves and endless halls
Trample down bronze gate of tartaros
Patient earthly men with (raised) bloodfilled chalices
Greeting Their arrival for the battle of the
ages is at hand and when the garish slave
of the seeds of life has turned into a
torrent of blood and the wolf has eaten the sheep

Stare into the galactic fog
- armageddon has been achieved

I've become and Empty Soulside Shell
From my Solemn Hill in the Sunset
I throw myself to Grim Forverhell

1. Rust

I come from a land
of systematic erasure of optimism and positiveness
You don't want to encourage me

Slowly corroding your fortified norm
Leaving you bitter, grim and sober

With rigid cramp or silent fear
I strangle what you do hold dear
With rigid cramp or silent fear
evoking addiction, limp, severe

It's sin again
Like charcoal on flaming nuns
Consistence unknown like early black metal

We're born without armor -
don't you think I'm watching my back ?!

With rigid cramp or silent fear
I strangle what you hold dear
With rigid cramp or silent fear
evoke addiction; limp; severe

Trilingual babel bastards
Hate at first sight
Cryptic blame enhancer
onto greyer pastures

Hail Hail onward Hail

Agnostic results from satanic wombs
Satanic results from agnostic wombs

Blazing azid
Devoid truth
Don't drink the water, they are rating you
Suicidal wrath on broken glass

onward Hail

Agnostic results from satanic wombs
Satanic results from agnostic wombs

3. Fucked Up And Ready To Die

Stripping on twisted knives in miscreation
Norway be my grave
Increasingly insecure
Combine with stagnant joy

Half my life in your name
Fucked up and ready to die

Death just takes a moment
Suffering is forever

Let's leave this sinking ship together
The water of life will fill your lungs
Drink 'till you bleed
When contradictions fail to soothe

Half my life in your name
Fucked up and ready to die

Murder only takes a moment
It'll last you forever

5. Divided We Stand

Divided we stand
Knucklescraping pain
Unlocked and insecure
To be all open wounds

Down there I see you
No no, further
Feebly twinkling
Stellar filth
Redeemers wacked up like suicide

I'm out of my cage
no time for scars now (I'm being fed)
Brigades of contempt
Maximus Lord of Lies

Curling up
for (the) ironic residue
Feebly twinkling
Stellar filth

How many hasn't cursed the wall ...
How many hasn't cursed the wall ?!


6. Striving For A Piece Of Lucifer

Striving for a piece of Lucifer
Don't you know it can never be digested ?
I've noticed a (certain) lack of demons lately
And it really worries me sick

Let's see who stands when the somke clears
Keep kicking that litter our way
We ain't about to throw the fight here
We all shall die

No sense of sublime estetics
No clue about obscure origins
So high on centerfold wisdom
Some tombs will never be silent

Let's see who stand when the smoke clears
Keep kicking that litter our way
We ain't about to throw the fight here
We all shall die


7. In Honour Of Thy Name

Sinking deeper into the fabric
Investing more in the movement
Facing east

Grease factories for weapons

Hail the new born king
Join the dead (join the dead)

Beautiful goat regime
Venomous perils
Do you feel safe ?

4. Straightening Sharks In Heaven

It would take a world of executioners
to see the need of henchmen in everyday life
(the) credibility of the meek
Stained with the juice of frustrated priests

What you don't feel will hurt (you) in hell
I'm straightening sharks in heaven
What you don't feel will hurt (you) in hell
We're straightening sharks in heaven

(when) All you take for granted is fake
And all the angles are on the take
Fear the silent majority
When you hate, God can't see you

The sins you don't feel will hurt (you) in hell
I'm straightening sharks in heaven
What you don't feel will hurt (you) in hell
We're straightening sharks in heaven

Demented anemic minions
Fuelled on crack propaganda
It's allright to love yourself
If you hate yourself

Alle gegen alle
Extract magic
Inflict havoc

Iconize yourself
Become a statue
So easily crushed
Watching the spoon glow

Alle gegen alle
Extract magic
Inflict havoc

Slay the dormant
stonesucking leech
Sing along to the bombs

7. Sacrificing To The God Of Doubt

The road is paved while we walk it
To the place where we pay for the sins
we have no yet paid for in life
Sacrificing to the God of doubt

Fuck hope
My empty stare just might make you
want to think twice

(more damage than) Misinformed philantropers
It's those christian thieves
Even the narrow path leads to Rome
Sacrificing to the God of doubt

Stray pulse
My empty stare just might make you
want to think twice

8. Hate Is The Law

9. Rawness Obsolete

1. The Cult Of Goliath

666 steps ahead
I can not be traced
You sense my presence here
Like the fear of cancer

HAIL BABYLON!
The cult of Goliath
Scraping on my fence
Feeble religious slugs

You can not come inside
Inferior to the might
You criticize the Cult
Stumbling confidence under my blackfoot
Uh!

Hail Babylon!
The cult of Goliath
Superior crown wielder
Dome of exclution

2. Too Old, Too Cold

Done with people

We're to old to fucking cold

True, hard, raw, and crusty
Underdogs and overlords

Informer of God
Yes, we earn a lot
By your ethical Machochism

You feel powerless
You shall not have
Other Gods than me

No forms of totalitarian thinking
Hand In hand
With a stagnating disarmament
For fucks sake!
You point out counterfactual cronicles
You should be fed to the living dead of Nairobi

You shall not have
Other Gods than me

Begging for this and asking for that

You copy my style
And call yourself a man

Never could fathom my hate
Unable to take a hint
Who am I? You haven't got a clue
Satanism is lost on you

The black weapon
War to prevent war
The dance of Narcissus
With cancelled armies

Victims, do your job
Die now - for your own good
Glorious fear worship
Don't mess with nothingness

1. Too Old, Too Cold

Nothing to prove
Just a hellish rock'n roll freak

2. High On Cold War

Everything is bigger than you think
...and you are smaller

The art of burning bridges
Hooked on greed

The negative way of evil
The failure of humanism
Paving your way to misery
I laugh as you run astray

The art of burning bridges
Hooked on greed

3. Love In A Void

Too many fools blocking my motion
Clouding my eyes...must be the potion
Spots on my eyes...must be the lotion
Love in a void...it's so numb
Avoid in love...it's so dumb
Love in a void

Too many bigots for my liking
Too many critics...too few writing
Rabid dogs that just ain't biting

Love in a void...it's so numb
Avoid in love...it's so dumb
Love in a void

Jaded reputation on which you're staking
Lots of money for the making
For all the stars they're just faking

Love in a void...it's so numb
Avoid in love...it's so dumb
Love in a void

1. These Shores Are Damned

Seeking fortune on these shores
I ridicule your hopes
Parasite in the realm
To be wiped away

You're doomed in that valley
Raised cages of cold
Wait for the next wave

The plague is here again
No dignity at all
Yes, you have been waste
And they will freeze, the night away

With my turning winds of high
You die a parrot state
I ride the wasteland
Powered by the will to deny

Seeking, fortune on these shores
I ridicule your hopes
Parasites in the realm
To be wiped away

Raised cages of cold
Wait for the next wave

You die a parrot state
I ride the wasteland
Powered by the will to deny

The will to deny
Yeah

2. Canadian Metal

Sex With Satan the loudest song
Sounds like a hammer from hell
Pyrokinesis and Take This Torch
Sounds that fill me with no remorse

Canadian Metal

Whimsical Uproar, Tortured Souls,
For these fuckin' sounds my angry heart calls
Canadian metal, just obey
On your weak sounds (new plastic metal) we will prey...

3. The Church Of Real Metal

If you think my castle
Is built on sand
Well bring on the tides
You can fuck off and die

Or river deep
You can fuck off and die

Fuck off and die!
Fuck off and die!
Fuck off and die!
Fuck off and die!
Fuck off and die!!

If you think my pain
Is well preserved
Then go ahead and try
You can fuck off and die

Far away from you
Disgusting subhuman fuck
You think you rule the world
Up my ass, tough luck!

I have my world here
You think you are right
But you can't touch me here
The forest is cold and white

Maximum distance to your idiocy
While you read and study a book
Yes, you are in many and crazy
Like flies to a pile of shit

I have my world here
You think you are right
You can't fool me now
My world is cold and white
My world is cold and white

Far away from you,
Disgusting subhuman fuck
You think you rule the world
Up my ass, tough luck!

I have my world here
You think you are right
But you can't touch me here
The forest is cold and white

Maximum distance to your idiocy
While you read and study a book
Yes, you are many and crazy
Like flies to a pile of shit

8. Pervertor Of The 7 Gates

9. Wisdom Of The Dead

You had Atlantis
You know that now
What can you see
From Valhalla's heights?

Perceive the glitches
Praise the glaciers
The final remnants
Of our key of greatness

You have the wisdom of the dead
These lesser lights should learn from you

Washed clean by ice
For lust our summers
For souls our winters
Until we die

1. The Winds They Called The Dungeon Shaker

In the depths of the underground
Through the nurseries of real metal sound
Governing the molten core
No more slavery anymore

The Winds! They Called - The Dungeon Shaker
The Winds! They Called - The Dungeon Shaker

We are older and wiser and the underground thrives
(but) posers are the same with their metal lies
In a seance of insanity with maniacal screams
Does your metal knows what metal really means?

The Winds! They Called - The Dungeon Shaker
The Winds! They Called - The Dungeon Shaker
To the Bone!!!


2. Death Of All Oaths (Oath Minus)

Our time of visit is over
And over again
Kneedeep in false idols
Demonic fairytales, prophets of nothing

The great death of all oaths
Burn you all into oblivion

Poisoned to admire our race
Poison all of your ideas
Putting the final end to it all
Breathing out the mantra

Past present and future prophets
Mould into meatball
My sole fire in vast forest
Nibble slowly, cosmos watching

The great death of all oaths
Burn you all into oblivion

4. Blacksmith Of The North (Keep That Ancient Fire)

Sound of iron, hard at work
Flames of triumph, we'll get
Keep that hammer pounding
The autumn of no regret

Keep our mountains free
Our shores clean of thee
Blacksmith of the north
Ancient fire is burning in me

The black rain is harsh
But they will learn
Our fathers of old
Not hearing the yearns

5. Norway In September

Those Cold Nights are back again
Norway Morning greet my daily toil
That Old familiar smell
Fallen leaves return to our Soil

From the First Day it has been with Me
Since My First steps Outsite it's been there
Nok en Skumring Levd for Siste Gang
Autumn Leaves I'm back Again

The Altar has broadened
Vast Plains of it now
20 years of Contemplating
Hating...
The Larger the Life, the Closer is Death

6. Grizzly Trade

Drastic Duties cloak my mind
In darkness they can't see my game
All walls are drawing nearer
Keep on pushing, I'll be born again

Courtmarshalled for doing my job
- Bitterness scraping at my thoughts
The stupid eyes of the world are watching
I will never cave in

In the cerebral abyss
The grizzly trade thrives
Unpleasant necessities
Uh, mandatory pain

I laugh at your distorted accusations
You're not worthy
See the blazing truth in these eyes:
You'll be judged by me on the other side


7. Hanging Out In Haiger

I'm in the air!!!
Hell bent for a Rockarolla trip
City lights wave beneath
This year it's Germany!!!

At the end of a dark ride
Guided by the general's eye
With of couple of die hard's
I'm hanging out in Haiger!

Well the party still ain't over
Checking' out the chainsaw cover
Another round in the bar in the cellar
- It's headbang heaven this night

8. Dark Thrones And Black Flags

9. Launchpad To Nothingness

10. Witch Ghetto

When... Comets crrackh!
Witch Ghetto attack
Remain secret - Brandish steel
Black Metal is unreal!

Witch Ghetto
Witch Ghetto
Witch Ghetto
Witch Ghetto

Bring me the ice of Mercury
Planets shrink, Universe expands
Wild roar of loose cannons
Break the Promised Land

Break the chains!

1. Those Treasures Will Never Befall You

Shaken and stirred in the dungeons!
Why is it you find yourself there?
Left in the mud - without a torch
(a fruitless endeavour) and no one cares!
...no they don't - ah!

Seen stumbling around in darkness - questioning honours and dreams
Those treasures will never befall you - they're out of reach

Crawling out at the foot of the mountain
Even weaker than when you entered!
When you have no soul and guidance is none, there's no use in being self-centered!!!
...no it ain't!

Seen stumbling around in the darkness - questioning honours and dreams
(then) those treasures will never befall you - they're out of reach...
...for you!

2. Running For Borders

Drowned in stellar dust
We create beginning and end
Crumbles constantly
We know the center of End
Who are you on stage?

Breathe deeply
Lungs filled with waste
Running for borders
Helpless heart
Pumping fuel, veins splintered
Thoughts divided

Building up chaos
Torn from haven
Answers never come
Floating wisdom

Ancient in its purest form
Gravitate towards center
Visuals fade
This is the realm of power

Stellar detonations
Universe is gloating, hovering
Judge, jury and executioner
Now freeze
Veins injected with time

4. Stylized Corpse

Walk around, like royalty
Just a stylized corpse
Life has reached the end
On the inside

Proud of what you have "achieved"
You'll soon see the truth, I'll show you
Grabbing my tools, I firmly believe
I'm your saviour and icon

Chain you to the wall
Blowtorch literally open your eyes
You feel superior now?
All you can do, is imagine my world
Let the chipmunks feast on your heart

Oh, this luxury life
All the juices of lies
Doesn't smell like a bowl of fruit
But I am strong and brute

Send you back among the dead
No one will see that you're born again
I'm your saviour, and I made your day
Sleeping in a pool of human debris

5. Circle The Wagons

You're scanning the landscape...
You feel like a true pioneer
As Romans you conquer
On top of your fear

(just) hope you awaken in time
And know that you are on my mind
Look over your shoulders - you're blind!
And circle the wagons

20 years later
I take you apart
You're asking - you're asking why?
I have no heart!

(just) hope you awaken in time
And know that you are on my mind
Look over your shoulders - you're blind!
And then!
Circle the wagons...

6. Black Mountain Totem

I am in a mountain cave
The night is playing outside
Seas yonder swim in starlight
Swirling fires grace the plains

There are treasures (the) night can't hide
And within me things no sun can see
This is where I stood my ground - opened gates for you and me

For each day that passes
I see more and more
Sometimes the universe opens
(and) the soul cries, hoarse and sore

Still I live for those moments
At least the ancient ones stand by my side
No matter how the human plagues weighs heavy
Night on earth can harbour eternal pride


7. I Am The Working Class

21 years of minimum wage
Got no problems with manual labour

You stepped up in the 90s, wanna show me how
Well, I don't need no fuckin' favour

I am the working class!
All day
So I don't have to
See your face

I am the working class!
Discipline
The daybreak is when
I begin

I am the working class!
Each day
I bust my bones to
Get paid

I am the working class!
Damn straight
The daily grind is
My fate

Through 7 seas of alcohol
And a jail of dank depression
Well, I turned my back and where are you now?
...and I've bucked up for that recession

8. Eyes Burst At Dawn

Struggled to awake for eons, merciless fate
Fingers moving, twisting sickly, silence is broken
Air is dead in this cave, dead as murdered
Only 10 feet crawling to get outside, black night
Hysterical laughter is hammering the stone walls

Ears bleeding... depressed

Overcoming psychical nightmares, starts crawling
Fingers broken, don't fucking care, move on

Outside the air is clean, cold and still
Eyes are open now, to see this dead night
Attacked by sudden fear, unknown constellations
Are threatening from above
Shivering cold, damaged brain, bleeding the blood
Alas, Deathstar is rising, finally to see this place
It gets brighter, hurting my eyes, can I bear this pain?

As my Deathstar is rising above the hills, my eyes burst
Pain so strong, havocing my head, it's dark again

1. Tundra Leech

In within circle unbound
Ripping roots from holy ground
Laying bare where needs sown
Caring nothing but my own

Can not cope pull the rope
Posers in breeding
Sown why bleeding
Damned ones destroy hope

TUNDRA LEACH!

Claim claims even forgotten
Resurrection carry back and forth
Begone stalemate and treason
Initiate the corrosive birth

The empty scraping
Wombs outbled, frozen
All terrain and no direction
(You) Crawl towards your own dissection

TUNDRA LEACH!

2. Burial Bliss

Against these files
You're necro civilization
The debris he makes

Chapels from the deep call my name
You will not understand
The age of sickness from beyond the wasteland

Breathe in trash clean and natural
I believe you to bask in confusion
Our answer will remain justified

Run, now run around
The circles will not be broken
A death of my own, your necro civilization
The debris he makes alone

Chapels from the deep call my name
Drink the drink clean and natural
I believe you to bask in confusion
Run, now run around
The circles will not be broken

3. Boreal Fiends

Against the mind, the boreal scepters
Hissing hollowly, gnawing rocks
Boulder shield dispersed by ice
Wailing souls threshed by nature's temptress

Where to find their shelter
Where to find their sparks
Where to build and live
And returns the sun's energy
...Once again
...Boreal fiends
Rest your shoulders and take in
Your cold and lonely dreams

Some witnessed the birth of pine
There was game to be had
Some died alone under the stars
For all this we are grateful

Where to find their shelter
Where to find their sparks
Where to build and live
And returns the sun's energy
...Once again
...Boreal fiends

Rest your shoulders and take in
Your cold and lonely dreams

4. Inbred Vermin

Weak minded inbred vermin
Call for the pesticide
Time will smoke out the rats
Breed like swarms getting weaker by the minute

People rotted on mountains
Running around with no clue
Freezing they're ice cold
Killed by their own plague
They will rot in the winds of the utter cold

We deny your rights to live
Vermin, filth, blood in streams running
For the edge of extension

People rotted on mountains
Running around with no clue
Frigid they're ice cold

Weak minded inbred vermin

5. Arctic Thunder

Yonder and forlorn
Lies the arctic thunder
Beneath the astral fires
Again the moon expires

Forgotten tomb sayer speaks
Here, above and under

(The) night shifts, sudden drifts
The destroyer
Paralyzed
Rest my eyes

Wallowing shores asunder
Arctic thunder

Piece these things together
Bear mark of atomic strength
Find those piercing ripples
Defy wretched lands and aws

Bring the thrive of glorious mornings
Bring sacrifice to life
Tear up the clouds at sunset
Merge the slow divide

For the arctic thunder

6. Throw Me Through The Marshes

Carry me through thick and secret walls
Wedge me into stone
Throw me through the marshes
Hide me in the dreams of the blind

Drag you screaming through my ignorant bliss
Fly you under each lake
Pedestal you in caves and dungeons
(And) engulf us in bone

These are the blue collared masonists
Yearning for transparent reign
Constructor of nine worlds
Built by force of bitter refusal

He had something to show you
(A) dramatic ancient slab in the mountains
A fragment of your life, it follows
Clings on towards that dying day

Deathbed

7. Deep Lake Tresspass

8. The Wyoming Distance

Once again roaming those plains of mine
You should not have entered
Control and lose control and rein 'em back in
I howl at the treelines while you see only night

I've built a Wyoming distance
A hole on the ridgeline this month
Every fiber all my life
Why am I the light to your moth

Angrily viewing the horizon smoke
Looks like I'll hunt a little (while) longer
I like it when (the) rays peer through the branches
Then tunneling back to the ranch unheard

I've built a Wyoming distance
Line them up - (it's) you and me
My every fiber all my life...
Made the fence you (now) taste

1. I Muffle Your Inner Choir

I muffle your inner choir
Rehearsing twisted screams
Level the jesters dream
Numbening your live wire

Click your shit boots together
We are not in hell anymore
In the land of the blind
The one eyed man is dead

Stew hack disagree
Brew the divine sweat
Eat the forest alive (you) unman
Pollute the entrails

Click your shit boots together
We are not in hell anymore
In the land of the blind
The one eyed man is dead


2. The Hardship Of The Scots

You buy your home
And follow a dream
No politics here
Just self esteem

A heart warms up
To where you feel home
No bastard rule of religion
Soil surrounds the stone

You get nothing for nothing
And souls do not exist
There is a concept of doom
Nature abhors a vacuum
the hardship of the scots
Uh!


3. Old Star

Der, Ved evighetens Utkikkspost
The old star dies for us all
An equator of tragedy
Stick out your fistfuls of hope

And out there in the fringes
The caravans are going in loops
Oblivious to the old star
while atlas cringes

Juggle your fears in the shadows
of altars to (the) diminishing beacon
No need to circle those wagons, even
The fingerless marble play ensues

And out there in the fringes
The caravans are going in loop
Oblivious to the old star
While atlas cringes

Paying for forests you separated
Atoning for hiding the rivers
Mankind dies
In a shroud of introvert mumbling


4. Alp Man

Half-hearted black-hearted rams
Interstellar fugitives
Doing their bit for the universal dam
Coined is the black metal prairie

Sharing your weapons
Will it lead to its dullness
Will you buy better (ones)?
Will they be forlorn?

Will you need a receipt, bounty hunter?
Your trade eventually took you to Swiss alps
Carefree void of everything, then might
High watcher; inner fear of scalping edges

This and these
Tear jerking calamities
Stuffed tightly with earth-like fears
Solemn shit no one hears

Prairie (seems like) a good choice now
The crimson sky is the limit
Although chances ahead are scarce
The racket is rigged as you die


5. Duke Of Gloat

Too old to wring the secret from the master
The well you encountered as a child
Merely acknowledging the beacon now
And now you are not well any longer

So this is the pact of the gloat
Double hell for all
All to repair and one to watch
No freedom in these domains

Hail the satan
Sinister duke of gloat
Wrap up the wretched fates
Intriguing eternal laughter

Encyclopedias
Of endless futile life toils
Shrapnel wounds
From shattered inner gargoyles

So this is the pact of the gloat
Brave beating hearts, But
All must repair while one beholds
No freedom in these domains


6. The Key Is Inside The Wall

The key is inside the wall
Every wall. Every way
Every minute. You don't understand
Dying reveals the wish

Wishing is the beyond
A seance is beyond
Talk to the four keys
Lock yourself in

Confused isolation heroics
Chilled concern fragments
Morbid kaleidoscope draws you in
Stigmata of satan pulls you out

Downbeaten souls, bowed heads
Competance of guardians impotent
Glorious idiots of the flesh
Stake out the danger in our heads

Walk free but mind your fingers
Thought you would fly away with satan
Fingers able. Just stumps now
The key is inside the wall

2. Blackest Ecstasy

With a crucifix - I smash her body
The deformation - is grotesque
My passion crawls - for your flesh
The ritual - can begin

Turn the cross - upside down
Into her - bleeding cunt
Urinate - in her mouth
Hack and fuck - for supper

Blackest
Ecstasy
Beyond the - boundaries
of pleasure

Sucking out - eating raw flesh
Fuck you whore - we burn in blasphemy
For sex I'll use her lovely head
Delightful orgasm - so deep in me

Blackest
Ecstasy
Beyond the - boundaries
of pleasure

I spill out - blackest blood
Prepare your return - this place you'll never leave
Evil thoughts - full of perversion
What a beautiful view - when I scratch your bones

3. Purity Throught Fire

Pushed down the stairs - built of coffins
Morbid fear - in the dungeons
Tied to the rack - knife across your breasts
Beaten and strangled - brutal shattered chest

Suffocate in blood

Extorted confession
Intense excruciatoin
Total evisceratoin
Await the execution

Nail driven into your eyes
Crucifix pressed to your forehead
Evil exorcised

Fucked by the bishop - in front of a laughing crowd
Forced down on your knees - Swallow holy cum
Torn out vagina - sawed off limbs
Glowing iron in your anus - broken on the wheel

Ripped to shreds

Extorted confession
Intense excruciatoin
Total evisceratoin
Await the execution

Now you are carried to the pyre
Soon to be released
Purity through fire

4. Behind The Black Moon

Walk the way of the hunter
Not the fucking victim
Take your own decisions
Follow your path
Hail misanthropy - hail nihilism
Behind the black moon
We praise satanics rebirth

Extreme extinction rages on without mercy
Battlefield chaos distor their souls
Behind the black moon

Taste unholy water and scream
Apocalypse will return
The sun turns into everlasting blackness
Dark centuries will arrive soon
Awake them and glorify
Their purebred blood
Behind the black moon
We praise satanics rebirth

Extreme extinction rages without mercy
Battlefield chaos distort their souls
Behind the black moon

Nail - the christ
Blood - above us

Black crucifixion of their god
Fesselt und geiþelt den Dornentrager
Black crucifixion of their god
Man effnet ihm die Seite

Nocturnal orgy of flesh -
the sabbath of blood
Mighty ritual of honour -
The sabbath of blood

6. No Ressurection

Desecrating - with possessed burning eyes
hell has risen - the gods of pain
Pull the veins - tear out the rotted soul
take the last breath - snuff out the life

No resurrection
Massacrate the lord of the weak
Buried blessings
Destroy the remains of Christ

In the burnt out chruches
They stand awaiting their doom
Indulge in their blood
Sepulture of hypocrisy

Light of holiness
Forever now extinguished
Edure eternal pain
You foolish ghost of god

7. The Requem Of Hell

A dislodged angel glide onto
Cold replacing blindness
Wash the rain away
Yearning for spraying posion

The requiem - of the antichrist
Far away - from the sun
The requiem - of the antichrist
Create hell on earth

bath in warm blood is her promised
Renounce the frosting death
Icer at the enslaved
Crying dying fearing gods

The requiem - of the antichrist
Far away - from the sun
The requiem - of the antichrist
Create hell on earth

Take these almight wings and fly away

9. Path Of Sin

Again and again and again
You bring me to ecstasy

You have died but I don't care
Burial place is not your true relief
Fistfucks in your backdoos hole
Necropenetrating lust takes command

Path of sin - sin
Create the sin - sin

In darkness we'll always be together
Forever your body belongs to me
Wrapped in pleasure we will burn
In eternity we shall be reborn

Path of sin - sin
Create the sin - sin

1. Necrodaemon Terrorsathan

Mutilated on the cross
Blackness covered the bastards flesh
Hear the trumpets of hell
See the fire through my eyes

Black winged angel
Reborn in chaos
Necrodaemon terrorsathan

Unholy sins inside my other hell
Praise the lord of disrespect
Let them die in their own curse
Because they don't feel

Black winged angel
Reborn in chaos
Necrodaemon terrorsathan

Necro-daemon
Terror-sathan

Blutsathan - Herrscher des Stolzes
Das Teufelsmal - Zeichen der Erhabenheit

In the purgatory of sin
Swear the oath of blood
The black mighty raven
Picks for the eyes of jesus

Black winged angel
Reborn in chaos
Necrodaemon terrorsathan


2. Vomit Upon The Cross

Gloriole on your worm eaten head
Foul air escapes your lying mouth
Tyranny throughout the centuries of pain
Blinded zombies followed into the decline

Kneeling... in a stinking church
Crawling... before an image of god

Obliteration of adoration...

Burn the scriptures - fuck your obnoxious sermons
Shove the host - up your sanctimonious rectums

Son of stench - oppressor of vice
Castrated savior - king of imbecility
We press the thorns deeper into thy rancid body
Perennial torture - get raped by our sins...

Deride the martyrs of their crumbling dogmas
Devoted vermin poisoned with impurity
Shoot the servants of this rotten kingdom
Abomination is the wages idolatry

Shed the blood of christ - vomit upon the cross

Kneeling... crawling...
Praying... Dying...

3. Diabolical Possession

Oh, unholy wings of death
Ceremony of darkness
Feel the kisses of the whip
Carnal excess - evocation is done

Diabolical possession
Wrapped in blasphemy
Diabolical possession
Deny christian slave morality

Adore my mighty sin
Drown the host in excrements
Immortality of dark desire
Adore my mighty sin
In the sing of the antichrist
Immortality of dark desire

Defecate on the altar of lies
Spoil the back of the goat
Voluptuosly vaginal explosions
Premature embryos - dancing in fire

Diabolical possession
Wrapped in blasphemy
Diabolical possession
Deny christian slave morality

Adore my mighty sin
Drown the host in excrements
Immortality of dark desire
Adore my mighty sin
In the sing of the antichrist
Immortality of dark desire

Crucified image of god
Extreme unction nears


4. Lust Perishes In A Thirst For Blood

I deserve your warm blood
Fuck your holy flesh
Use my cock anal
Lick my unholy cum
Submit your juicy hole
Beg for fresh urin

Bleed for sathan

Lust perishes in a thirst for blood
Lust perishes in a thirst for blood
Lust perishes in a thirst for blood

Swallow my unblessed piss
Beautiful nazarene whore
My dick spreads cold disease
Seduced through passion
Of the sinful snake
Ass and cunt breathe no more

Lust perishes in a thirst for blood
Lust perishes in a thirst for blood
Lust perishes in a thirst for blood

Lust perishes in a thirst for blood
Lust perishes in a thirst for blood
Lust perishes in a thirst for blood

I consume - your bloodred - delightful breast
Your magnificent - toes - are my dessert
In bonds - kneedeep - you bath in my sin
Necrofuck - is your - destiny

Contempt for christianity knows no limit
The so - called chosen people can fuck off

Brutal treatment - is now unleashed - SBSR
Annihilation - of the christians - SBSR

The man who has never been in the clutches
Of a crushing riper
Can never know what its poison is - its poison is

Sirens roars - cruelity impress - SBSR
Bullshit culture - leat them into ruin SBSR

Every crossing between two breeds spreads disease
Holiness responsible for lies and weakness

We rape your will - dominate with shudder - SBSR
Pillage the prophets - soon nothing will remain - SBSR


6. Sadism Unbound / Lechery On The Altar

Reign of violence - behind convent walls
Diving into - vile debaucheries
Cock craving nuns - degenerated clerics
Mortify the flesh - united in blasphemy

Divine pleasure through infernal pain...

Incestous orgies
Meaningless torture
Anal excesses
Wanton cruelty

Sadism unbound - screams of torment
Passions of murder - dagger plunged into the throat...

Drunken bishop - screwing smelly vaginas
Lechery on the altar - flesh crazed sanctity
Asses whipped to shreds - cum decorates the cross
Captive virgins flogged - with the scepter of sodomy

Divine pleasure through infernal pain...

Incestous orgies
Meaningless torture
Anal excesses
Wanton cruelty

Sadism unbound - screams of torment
Passions of murder - dagger plunged into the throat...
Sadism unbound - screams of torment
Passions of murder - strangled with a rosary...

Near the black forest
Enemies lost their lives
Bloody dews drips from the trees
The goal is nearly reached

Near the black forest
Faith turns into blasphemy
Cover the cross with excrements
Speak the words - we are free

8. Cremation Of Holiness

Christ has died - squealing like a pig
Hellish torment - seething flesh
Mocked and spitted at - his lies now ignored
Kill his minions - exterminate 'em all

Behead the disciples of god...

Turn their churches into abattoirs
Wade in desecrated blood
Bomb the vatican - crucify the (polish) whore
Cremation of holiness - destruction of faith

Profanation - Blasphemation
Fornication - Bloodperversion

2. The Goatchrist

Bloodlust - on the altar

Cruelty is – your life that binds
Insanity is – your flesh that blinds
Mighty is – your teacher this pain
Your prison – your wish to attain

Burn my moral – restriction
Beyond excruciating constriction
Beyond the flesh – to wander free
Beyond the flesh, the soul of me

A cruel master – I hearken unto thee
Disease and suffering – shall set you free
Let death – dance as a knife
The steps in time – to bleeding strife

Burn my moral – restriction
Beyond excruciating constriction
Beyond the flesh – to wander free
Beyond the flesh, the soul of me

Burn my moral – restriction

I am the endless desert
The burning horizon

Beyond the pitch black night
Time and space collide in me

No god be compared

Oh, so bright

Unmatched by man on earth - I play my spell
Collecting souls - from my trance
My appetite for flesh - boundless

Thousand hearses - gushing out
The fiery eyes - of the dead

Abhorrent human race - you are disease
Death, misery and plague - upon the earth
I dance with demons - through the night
As floods and fire - make things right

Spell of reflection

Their bows shall be broken apart
And their swords shall enter their own hearts

I mirror your hate - vomit your disgust
Put your blade - against my throat
Decapitated - you shall fall
In ashes and dust - your bones will rot. Eternally.

Spell of reflection

Their bows shall be broken apart
And their swords shall enter their own hearts

Et arcus eorum confringatu

8. Embracing A Star

I embrace a star - the pentagram, it illuminates
The cosmic energies - of the eternal divine

Lay before me - flesh to adore!
The body below - only a tool

Primal force of nature's core
Fill me now, gimme more

Instincts must yield - to the magickal rule!
I am rooted
I am perfect
I am ready

I open my arms - legs wide apart
Touch the five points
The shape is complete

Every man and every woman is a star

Sex-Magick, self-creation
I am the giver
I am the taker
I am the receiver

Bigger than life - I embrace a star
Fueling its core - to burn ever more

Emotionless passion - simple and cruel
I enter the flesh- to please myself

Creating and growing - within my own skin
