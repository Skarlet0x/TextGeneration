In the Devoid of Sorrow
The Air and my Heart full of Luster
Behind the Mountains
There must be a key to the Gates
Right passed easy Talk
We can once again walk the Path of Sorrow
Let the Turn of Search bring you away
Two Shades of the Midnight Fire
In the Night Sky
You waiting Child walk with me
Walk by Side of Fall
The Essence to open those Gates
And still we must walk the Path of Sorrow
The secret Lights in the Sky
Vision
All one
It seems
The Blades are sharpened
They will all learn
Yes, Destroy your Dream
Your Desert of Dreams
It's undeserved
For Dark Medieval Times
Here, upon the Hill
You all find Wisdom
Waiting for a lot of
Endless screaming
Desert of Dreams
Eternity in your Dreams
Here you are
Dark Medieval Times
Into The Mighty Forest
As I walk
With a Spirit
Into the binding Forest
In Fog and Darkness
I walk
I disappear
Into the mighty Forest
It's beyond the sweet
And tainted Landscapes
The Shadow walking
Your Sanctity
Soughts the Story
Of Generations
Dark Forest Trees over the Funeral,
All day the Army ride
They moved in deeper
So Dark that they weren't even
Too lead us passed this wicked Dense
I can fell the Presence of the Shadowthrone in the deepest Dark
When cold Winds Freeze
When Night came and dark Fog came over me
Let that Horde come to me
As they walk right by
When all the Death is near
I wander eternally
Invincible Fog is near
We walk the Fields of War
The Cloak of the Moon it can slip all them through
And the Flame is the Wrath of his Sword
In the mist of the shadows by the river of the fogpalace
Two great spears and a flag of dominion and hate
Over the chasm riders of doom
And sometimes the water dares to reflect
As days pass by and the light is becoming weaker
I can watch the death of the sun from my enormous view
Still sometimes I thought my own eyes were deceiving me
Many a misty morning's battle 
Further on more experience
Soon it's time to hear the sound of the horn in far distance
The deathtone call for war
In the mist by the hills the day darkens
In this forest death rules
Over this chasm riders of doom and face him with a deadly pale spectre face
Grim as stone, ride to the deathfields 
Blackness and doom
A total eclipse of the sun
Die by the northern triology in the mist by the hills
In grey depressive autumn times I wander the woods to eternity searching for
him trying to remember while the same shy still rules the night
We knew then 
That these were the children of god
The ones who betrayed me and my desire
This must be the desolate land 
this is the kingdom of the shadowthrone
centuries have gone beyond time, 
and we in the land beyond the forest, 
we burnt them in the purgatory, them the children of god 
Barely forgotten these times are, 
but not for a soul whose rest hasn't been found
From beyond come the storms
Landscapes turn to ash before my pressured eyes
Nothingness turns to nothingness
And my imagination fades like dustclouds over
This deserted land feel to now satyricon
Wonder how stormclouds rage
And all you can feel is the cold winds of
Funeral times, timeless they are
He saw lived and died
In these dreams of demons
Wondering how he could open the gate to
Dark medieval times and bring forth to the domains
of satyricon, two great spears and a flag of dominion
And hate
Above it all creations fall
Living for the quest and the search
Dying for the key, living for the domains
Arise northern spirit and come forth under
The might of the castle satyricon
Summon thy hidden wisdom, gather the unholy hate
Winter is at hand, frozen my tears will be
Created by blasphemy
The edge of my sword, the powers of my mind
Winter is at hand, as two torches blaze in the dark
A warrior dressed in black, granted eternal life
Black winds blow my hair, as the voice of the night
Whispers my name
Blackened ground, misty sound
Hear the call for war, the master calling his
Warriors to explore by the sign of the horns
As the dawn arises the souls of a thousand
Young men shall go wild
As the fire shines into the night they're sitting by
The campfires awaiting the dawn
Through years of knowledge, 
man rode the wings of evil
Through the enormous winter, 
three years without summer
Prepared for the battles of the north
I sat on my throne and watched between
The skies of a cold northern light
Knowing this was my ground, 
but those who turned their backs
Against my throne, 
only got my sword on their back!
I rose from my throne, and walked away with the wind
Through centuries of weakness
Only the strong follow me, on my crusade of darkness
In this land where the forest is my throne
I have come to re-hunt
Come come infernal war awake beasts of hell
free yourself from the chains that have been holding you for 666 years
We await sodomy and destruction
It is the night of the triumphator starts the burning of heaven
On this night in the pentagrams power we shoot the angels down from the sky
and we sodomize the dirty whores of babylon on christian ground
On this night we torture the betrayers
Night night holy night of the triumphator
rape the nuns, hang the priests, 
cut the throat of the crying christians
He wander the fields of death 
In eternity wandering our own path
Which has been the quest of immortality
Yet to conquer for me, but dreams shall not be torn
He is spirit
He is stone
And he is immortality
The king of the shadowthrone
And even the conqueror of death
Fell as a stone from the mountain
And time led to destruction
Once he left, he knew then in the past
That the seeds should be worthless
Spirit rise from your rest and return for them
I am spirit
I am stone
And I am immortal
This is Armageddon
And I looked, and behold a pale horse
And his name that sat on him was Death
And Hell followed with him. And power was given
Unto them over the fourth part of the earth,
To kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death,
And with the beasts of the earth.
And then again I saw and beheld, a black horse;
And he that sat on him had a scythe; 
And a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.
And there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black
As sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood.
And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth,
Even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs,
When she is shaken of a mighty wind. 
And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together,
And every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
Almighty mountains and rocks, I beg you fall on them.
For the great day of wrath is coming, and who shall be able to stand?
Mother north 
how can they sleep while their beds are burning?
Mother north 
your fields are bleeding
Memories
The invisible wounds
Pictures that enshrine your throne gone?
A Future benighted still they are blind
Pigeonhearted beings of flesh and blood
Keeps closing their eyes for the dangers that threat 
ourselves and our nature
And that is why
They all enrage me
Sometimes in the dead of the night I mesmerize my soul
Sights and visions prophecies and horror
They all come in one
Mother north
united we stand
together we walk
Phantom north
I'll be there when you hunt them down
I am the beast in passionate pain
I am the grim being of the highlands
Of the other side
I am winter when you freeze
I am the hammer and you are the anvil
Forever in warfare my heart is
With my passion of despair
Still though I was there when the hills were born
And when the wind blew for the first time
So there are reasons for my existence
Seems like I dwell in a circle
Somewhere in the Nordic Hemisphere
Where the howling winds rage
And the mountains are majestic
I can breathe and where there is
Human flesh I feel strangled
Open the gate to immortality
I stand proud awaiting the glory
Of a new morning... darkness
I am the one Orgasmatron
The oustreched grasping hand
My image is of agony
My servants rape the land
Obsequious and arrogance
Clandestine and pain
Two thousand years of misery
Of torture in my name
Hypocrisy made paramount
Paranoia the law
My name is called religion
Sadistic
Sacred
Whore
I twist the truth
I rule the world
My crown is called deceit
I am the emperor of lies
You grovel at my feet
I rob you and I slaughter you
Your downfall is my gain
And still you play the sycophant
And rebel in your pain
And all my promises are lies
All my love is hate
I am the politician
And I decide your fate
I march before a martyred world
An army for the fight
I speak of great heroic days
Of victory and might
I hold a banner drenched in blood
I urge you to be brave
I lead you to your destiny
I lead you to your grave
Your bones will build my palaces
Your eyes will stud my crown
For I am mars the god of war
And I will cut you down
Without beginning, without end 
our lifeblood
the road for the spiritual outlaw is never ending
and so is the hunt for all those answers
the devil may hold your truth, what a fucking relief it would be to know
bluecold and the grim truth stands before you, all you ever wanted
Descend and fly away to another day, another night
sleep forever or serve to justify
The brand that you wear speak of what you are made of
It leaves you like an open book for everyone to read
Is this it, is this what you wanted?
The eye of the rest on your back
To be a part of the masterplan is the only way to spiritual hell
drink to that and never forget where you came from
cause there's no such thing as one way ticket to hell
what a fucking relief that is
Descend and fly away to another day, another night
sleep forever or serve to justify
They say that you've born to the eternal kidness
And that was conceived by divine grace
That came to finish with the pervertion and evil
And died on the cross to humanity save
The pervertion and evil only start after you came
Because you was only a crazy lier
False saints were with you on your insanity
And the more stupids belived on you
Thieves and corrupts
Now eleited priests
They sellet pieces
Of cloth saying it were yours
The chief of insanity
Now is reigning at home
The pervertion and evil
Only start after you came
Salvation 
A merciless hand
from below holding the melancholy of
a million strangled souls Part 
melancholy
So warm and glorious
embraced in a black mass
a mass which holds
the pain of oppression Part 
oppression
I'll reach out for that salvation hand
and accept its shinig blessing
so that I can bear their pain and longing Part 
longing
Sinful woman walk with me cause I'm the wolf on your shoulder
but complain not to me, cause I'm the accuser
If you dare to withhold the immense power and the greed
you shall walk among us to subterranean fields
Why don't you come with me
and dance the snake pit dance
rhythmic moves to the eerie bells, the boiling blood
evils breath on your neck, the morbid rite
I'm tied in bronze chains
so where do all the flowers come from
I am tired, should I care anymore?
The rusty claws who reach for me are too far away
sense no anger for that, be at one
The sleaze on the Wall is all gone anyway
it's just flowers, flowers
Come, come let's join the orgy
decay and wine, sodomy all the way
no rest for the holy
forbidden fruit is always best
dirt 'n filth tastes so good
I see the cross of Peter overwhelming their coward countenance
Oh you're so damned clean, now take my dirty whore, hell fire is inside her
contaminate the clean, woman. Let him feel you're venom
It's the only way to release the chains
My candle is burning at both ends, I just want to be released before I go
It's a harsh voyage, to the land of sin
I had to make sure to bring 'em down with me
I am the last of my kind and I'm tied in bronze chains
Filthgrinder, no-love machine, cleaner
unknown to remorse and pity
cynical, electric fuckin' murderer
What a scenery, 
the heavy pulse beat of the Unholy Alliance and the white fear
Take a look around and understand, 
that your days are numbered
the demon on the Wall and the ticking clock
closing in on that final grasp for air 
do you still believe?
The future beast is rising and tyranny has come for 777 years
reach out for mercy, it's just a bygone anyway
Filthgrinder
practice aggression
Filthgrinder
protect the wealth of the Elite
Filthgrinder
tremble upon the ugly
True-born creature, twist that Firm grasp of yours
like in days of old
He can feel it, he knows they can't
to be in league with the underworld can't be mistaken
you don't believe, you know!
He chants a primitive gospel, so very hard
The mechanisms of destructive behaviour can be an art form in itself
The beast risen represents no so called dark mercy
evil knows no good, good knows no evil
but a saviour he is in all forms, but religious
a Grand engine carrying years of built up Hatred
and Powers. You know that, isn't that why I can smell your fear?
Your heart trying to rip its way through your chest
Filthgrinder a beastified being risen from the collective
hatred of an oppressed people.
A people representing Pride, Dignity and Honour!
Wonder how it would be to be the great Redeemer
the one to bestow upon you life and death
the one to poison you when you're down
or to be the one to hand you the crown of thorns
when your hands are sore
and to save you from the everything you care for
Are you bitter when you see how pale you are?
Do you feel hate without direction?
A kind of seed inside you that never blossoms
It is at the gallows end one forgets that everything
has to have a greater meaning
An unrecognisable call drags you towards the unspoken word
to suffer Martyrdom for the others
The Saviour cut off your wings, somehow just to remind you that He exists
Those who wait for His salt with open wounds have a way to go
the shadows of your must rest first
Though I ask, why do you dig your own grave when others do it for you?
The force behind the hit can not be mistaken
'cause He's the saviour with magnanimity and
a light in the dark
Maybe it is intimidating more than lighting the way,
where is the road going? 
To a place where you can wash the blood of your hands?
Where did the knowing go?
With a saviour to transcendental kingdoms
or to the valley of the forgotten?
behind the vault of the sky's mystery lies a dream
damned or saved, how could we ever know?
He would kill the white-draped men
He would kill all holy men
He would kill the powers in control
to waste these jokers in this pathetic game
He would choke the sleaze pig
He would shepherd the sheep off the cliff
He would crush all organs of speech
to start the process of renewal
He would avenge the dead
He would crave divine protection
He would sing the songs of darkness
to call upon it to manifest
He would "mirror" himself in the tundra frost
He would rape its virtue
He would disable its ways of hurting him
to give him that advantage
This would be the way of the misanthrope
in order to create you must destroy
We would greet the nuclear morning mist
We would smile at all life dying
We would cherish each and every moment
and celebrate the return of Sin
We would bow to the planet's Iconoclast
we would march under the flag of Dominion and Hate
we would burn all conspirators
and their works with 'em
We would reveal the only truth
we would make them really sorry
we would show them Sovereignty in true fashion
and then be a reflection of their loss
We would soak up the last joys of our lives
we would Hail that grotesque destiny
we would walk on to the last glory
and hope for blessing to come
A rotating silver-colored plateau, drops that dance down the columns
Blue, cold and the raging star wind
glowing colors at fearful speed
indistinct pictures of prophets and visionaries in a galactic fog
in outer space on an axis
In another reality on a supersonic journey
inevitably he can see it, the lights are going out and he knows
if he just could make us understand
In the emptiness there is nothing that can draw the picture you want
just a stillborn child on hands that fumble
Raging, raging at incomprehensible pace
the colors blinding, the plateau falls in outer hell
They disclose that we had to die 
We bit the hand that fed us
in outer space on an axis
In another reality on a supersonic journey
Is this what is yet to come, or a madman's reflection of the soul?
As when his heart cried out in pain when he perceived what
burdens we were to bear
Without beginning, without end our lifeblood
the road for the spiritual outlaw is never ending
and so is the hunt for all those answers
the devil may hold your truth, what a fucking relief it would be to know
blue-cold and the grim truth stands before you all you ever wanted?
Descend and fly away to another day, another night
sleep forever or serve to justify
The brand that you wear speak of what you are made of
It leaves you like an open book for everyone to read
Is this it, is this what you wanted?
The eye of the rest on your back
To be a part of the masterplan is the only way to spiritual hell
drink to that and never forget where you came from
cause there's no such thing as a one way ticket to hell
what a fucking relief that is
Descend and fly away to another day, another night
sleep forever or serve to justify
Break down all conventional forms and create chaos to reinvent order
Rebel against all circles and dead ends
fight your way with your mind set on the masses
execute with mechanical aggression
arrogance and extravagance
march on unapproachable
shut out the outside pressure
or are you too weak?
when shall they see the real darkness?
In a world where our justice is replaced by mercy
mercy for the inferior
The serpent's maelstrom is already here
just waiting to be unchained
so feed the fire with the vile and let sincerity rule
why can't you see that the armoured hostile aura is meant to keep you away in all your primal simplicity
it seems like fright procreates the downfall of the mind
such a sin isn't it
the stagnation of it all
You must collect your instruments of battle
and protect, to emancipate that which lives within you
Rebel against the chains
Break down the embodiment of your pain
Attack with robot precision
Rise and Shine under Wings of Divinity
Now pick me up night and whirlwind
and let me ride with you
to peace of mind and nothing to Rebel
On my signal, unleash Hell
Who made deceit into the ultimate award?
Who told you, you're not poisoned?
I see the snake coiling inside you
I see the venom in your eyes
You can't stab me, or even touch me
You can't betray me, it's just an illusion
I built the pain inside you
I spawned the snake
It will gradually tear you apart
It will eat you from inside
No longer sweet revenge
No longer emotional triumph
Pity you, led to believe in own willpower
Pity you, resting on withered laurels
Can't you see, the world's on fire
Can't you feel, you're getting burnt!
There's a day coming, for me to rip and to rape
There's a winter coming, for you to be swallowed
Swallowed by emotional cold
Swallowed by a power much greater than yourself
Who made deceit into the ultimate award?
Who told you, you're not poisoned?
I see the snake coiling inside you
I see the venom in your eyes
You can't stab me, or even touch me
You can't betray me, it's just an illusion
I built the pain inside you
I spawned the snake
Born into a field of flowers, to slowly wilt away
Sheltered by wings, delicately smothered by blindness
Released among the wolves, thus molded by resistance
Ridden by the clawed hoofs of tyrants
The fruit of other worlds, but grown by loneliness
Concealing a black soul, and but sensing the beyond
Uniquely grown from within
Shimmered by a darker night, but left to solitude
How can one disclose a darker night,
If one but rests?
Or evidence the suffering,
By wordly gauge?
Or comprehend the long-drawn agony
When pain and evil never trod one down
Like a warring sun, from a better kingdom
Beautiful, free, of different steel!
Dearly prized, and equally broken
He should have gone free of you!
An emotional tumour, gnaws from inside
Of heartless, spineless treason
The darkest night now weaves its loom
Soon to release its spawn
Scornful, relentless memory
Ripped of all but drive
Undressed by betrayal
Zero tolerance for the souldead
Wish I was the violence,
Inflicted upon you
Fuel for Hatred, air raid siren to mankind
Little you,
Still like a claw in my eye
Pulsating organic rage
I should have let you off of the hook
Mind drifts
Into dynamic pain
Universal onslaught
I'm on my own
One soul, one hate
Fuel for Hatred, air raid siren to mankind
Damnation, holocaust
Devil horns for you to ride
Time for the angel
To spread his wings and fly
World opponent,
Wishmaster of gruesome pain
Stormtroops' frantic fury,
Demoniac spitfire!
Abortion of religious life, distinguish the rot
I hate you
To a level of intoxication
Don't feel alone,
I've got enough
I wish you slow death,
Slow death by grinding
Fuel for Hatred, air raid siren to mankind
Crawling down the road of life
Another hopeless speech
Gruesome soul numbness
People stare, do they know
I am suffering the tyrants
Every gesture is a malicious attack
A firm fist of misery
But it shall not coincide
With the Lion's downfall
There are no tears
No feeling of guilt
Nowhere to channel the anger
Nowhere to leave the pain
How can they feast upon the Lion without knowing?
He will eventually rise again
Hunt him down when He is at his weakest
Tempt him down on His knees if you can
Stronger than all so it's futile
All there is left right now is personal pride
Enough to return with rays of light
Mourning the decay
Bitter ungodly enemy
Cast into heavy woe
Left in the corner of the world
we are possessed
Out of the maze, with clearsight 
at the brink of one's abyss
Out of the maze, with clearsight 
cold eyes at the world
Out of the maze, with clearsight 
disbelief and scorn
Out of the maze, with clearsight 
not poisoned by your fraud
we are possessed
The realisation of the position
No longer vulnerable
Having played the music no one could understand
Serenade to the devil's den
He, the final frontier!
Defaming judgement
Upon the starving souls
Mourning self-made pestilence
Cannon fodder for the
Apocalypse
A haunt for every unclean spirit
Lord of the flies or kingdom of death
Circle the prey, show them your eyes,
They bear witness of centuries of might
Predecessor who blessed us with grace
In sempiternal fight
Excessive aggression
Fire is the definite sign of rebirth!
The elders' electrons channelled through you
Carried by thy night Supremacy
Born to win this battle, defeat is the tongue
Of the whore
Do we need another bastard nation
Another force-fed disgust
Do we need another bastard nation
Aiming at us clinically
Like an insect-swarm
Towards the shapeless mouth
Of a dead whore
We need the spirit, the voice, the angel of light
Arising from melted mass
We need the spirit, the voice, the angel of light
Taking invincible shape
To standing ovation
Repossessing night and her hand's godly touch
The unbearable feeling of hitting that
Dark wall is a scene that must come to an end
Eartly decay in front of our eyes
Now, now it's killing for a living
No more repined bastard nation
A generous gesture to a people so blind
No more repined bastard nation
Fumbling, descending, away from the light
It takes a non-poisoned creature
To withstand a monster that has grown and spawned,
A darkness, I can not tolerate
A darkness we must bury
Do they feel, do they absorb our pain
The search to justify one truth
Do they feel, do they absorb our pain
The greater understanding
It takes a non-poisoned creature
To defeat and destroy a monster,
That has grown and spawned
A darkness, a darkness we can not tolerate
Past tense icons
Locked up in cages
A disgrace to us, and a vital sight of impending doom
Upheld by insane aggression
No tender repentance, just denial of ugliness
With the rain come their conquest
Behold those who ride black winds
Satan, the kings are heading home
No harmony on the horizon
When our haven burns silently
An image of absolute mutiny
Against those who pertain to the dearest hell
Monotonous graveyard plains
The soul exile
Quintessence of pain
A higher form of suffering!
Why should man be protected,
What has he done to justify it?
This is why we embrace animals;
They represent the innocence man doesn't have
Monotonous graveyard plains
The soul exile
Quintessence of pain
Satan, the kings are heading home
Grey heavens, no light shed
Bleak day, change is ahead
Oval mountainside, naked cold
Unreleased powers, no fright
Slide down sorrow, smell what comes with the breeze
Cold chambers, punishment awaits
Hollow tone haunts, anticipation's choir sings
Turn around, face the depth of inner sanctum
Autumn in the air
World moves, in mysterious ways
Body onwards, mind drifts
You die, then we hail to our relief
New age dawns
Face all wrath
Sickness won't understand,
Burning first
Grace falls
Volcano shaking
Fates are being sealed
Heavens blunder,
No turning back
Will you or will you not
To heroism walk
Black Lava, drifting down the mountainside
Black Lava, you can't fight
Pernicious flow, redemptive perpetuity
Unholy drive, the gods arrogant grin
If my world's a joke, do you see them smile?
Hellbound me
on a throne of gold
Wastelands prey on dying cattle
Desert sucks on poor man's thirst
Glimpse of glory, walk ahead
Slaves of Nazareth, can not be fed
Black Lava, drifting down the mountainside
Black Lava, you can't fight
Gods of the land remember him
For he has served the purpose
And sworn to thee
Master of the mountains
Spirit of the sea
Bringer of justness
Lord of the dark ways
Flee from him, for he is pure
As any soldier can be
Fighting a cause
Free as any wanderer
Armed with flame
Blazing force
Risen from time
Rebel's son
Remember the fallen
And what they did
Memory is how to
Understand the future
Troubled by those
Whose spirit is torn
From mind and body
Never surrender!
Destined by the elders
And by them acclaimed
Ascending from the abyss
Sunset for the Triumphator
The soul when stripped of all
Lies in the hands of what?
Inner chaos roars, nerves boil
Now, where to go
A lifetime of slow inner death,
How torture is that?
Chocking fear, is life real?
And what is dying?
What if void is a shellshock's aftermath?
What if Eden is all poisoned fruit?
What if hell is forever pain?
What if life is a blindfold, and death is punishment?
Global puppetshow, made by hands of transcendental divinity
Blood rives cascades, could be virtual reality
World war slaughter, could be the final act
And graveyard paradise could be eternity's curtain
Who are the ones with the keys?
Will they lead us
Life is nothing but untimely answers
To our existential fear-questions
Fear reared its ugly head
Death came to me on a somber morning
Bloodshot eyes
metal skin
Serpents tongue 
dagger claws
Dragon wings
crooked horns
Beholding the might
In its dawn of grace
In its beauty and light
In its pride and glory
Rushing torrent
time and space
Elder lords
crack the soil
Gone or dead 
you've never been
Kingdom come 
hear the roar
Climbing down
To rule the earth
Bloodshot eyes
metal skin
Serpents tongue 
dagger claws
Dragon wings
crooked horns
Upon high places
With their heads up high
With their lives at stake
With their blades at hand
Triumph come 
beyond the gate
Giants rise
from the pits
Worlds collide
chaos reign
Dawn of gold
age of gods
Climbing down
To rule the earth
Bloodshot eyes 
metal skin
Serpents tongue
dagger claws
Dragon wings
crooked horns
Lightning strikes 
wake up now
He the fourth
hate the weak
Summon all
make the signs
Legions march
earth to void
Climbing down
To rule the earth
Bloodshot eyes
metal skin
Serpents tongue
dagger claws
Dragon wings
crooked horns
Overture of evil
Aggressive force
Stamp of authority
The world is his stage
Always rise when down
Never bow to doubt
Pain is temporary
Pride is forever
The Destroyer
Resisting fire
Firm as a rock
Smelling fear
Unleash the storm
If they lust for death
Give them death
What they want
Is what you'll give
In the house of lords
We control the movement
Of your limbs
There is endless beauty
In the might that we possess
Dragons are creatures
Of our own imagination
And dragons
Dragons breathe fire
We throw stones in the water
And see the waves
That we create
We push
Push hard
Predatorial instinct, built for the kill
Commando
Stones in the water
Commando
The Age of Nero
Keep looking for morning
In the shelter of night
While we renew our strength
Transfusing my blood
New layers to the core
I am ready now
As the world kneels
We push
Push hard
Predetorial instinct, built for the kill
Commando
Stones in the water
Commando
The Age of Nero
She's roaming free
Tucked with a lifeline
She's haunting me
Rocked by the netherworld
Consciously comes to me
Down on her knees
Painfully she moans indeed
Rapidly aggressively
Daggers shine and daggers kill
Nightfall 
the nights that gods can't undo
Chaos Alive
looking for the faith I had
Demonic
their faith brings me another battle
The Wolfpack
Your path is lit
Look for the alpha
Drugged to the bone
In the devils grip
Consciously comes to me
Down on her knees
Painfully she moans indeed
Rapidly aggressively
Daggers shine and daggers kill
Nightfall
the nights that gods can't undo
Chaos Alive
looking for the faith I had
Demonic
their faith brings me another battle
The Wolfpack
Warcraft of the witch
Ceremonial ritual
This is the dream
That came to follow me
Nightfall
the nights that gods can't undo
Chaos Alive
looking for the faith I had
Demonic
their faith brings me another battle
The Wolfpack
Hidden under its wings
The darkness you wish to hide
Bearer of ugly truths
Grey
Somber morning
Through blurry glass
The black crow
Here comes the messenger
Found bringer of dark days
Here comes the messenger
Black crow on a tombstone
Stare
That reeks of death
The posture
Makes you tremble
Here comes the messenger
Found bringer of dark days
Here comes the messenger
Black crow on a tombstone
She'll seek
And find you
Make you remember
Here comes the messenger
Found bringer of dark days
Here comes the messenger
Black crow on a tombstone
Hidden under its wings
The darkness you wish to hide
Bearer of ugly truths
On a grey
Somber morning
Through blurry glass
The black crow
Here comes the messenger
Found bringer of dark days
Here comes the messenger
Black crow on a tombstone
They ride the winds
Avoiding resistance
Choosing not to fight
Wanting to live
To lie another day
Pale figures in life
And so in death
A painful existence
Wanting so much
Yearning to be
You know you lose
And I'm glad it hurts
Die by my hand
As close as you'll ever get
Die by my hand
Accept defeat and find peace
You seek the truth
That you define
Waving the flag
Of the pitiful kind
You could never prepare
For my battle cry
Die by my hand
As close as you'll ever get
Die by my hand
Accept defeat and find peace
My skin is cold and the birds fly free
Over my head, where winter grows
A heathens call, stand up or fall
This world is yours, for you to rule
This, the blood of sin
Flows freely
This, unstoppable force
In the naked flesh
My skin is cold
your skin is cold
Black metal rock and a scent of leather
And bloodstained gold
With rain and wind come times of change,
and dream come true
I go with you, on the path we make
This, the blood of sin
Flows freely
This, unstoppable force
In the naked flesh
My skin is cold
your skin is cold
Snow covered mountain
I gaze in awe
Wondering who and what was here before
I made my mark on that sacred soil
This phoenix rose from a pit of pain
This, the blood of sin
Flows freely
This, unstoppable force
In the naked flesh
My skin is cold
your skin is cold
One nations man carrying the weight,
of a peoples disgrace
This is the turnaround!
Driven by birthright and godsent will
The time has come for you to rule
This, the blood of sin
Flows freely
This, unstoppable force
In the naked flesh
My skin is cold
your skin is cold
Axis of faith
Raw, and untamed in spirit
To do and undo
We chew this world
And Spit it out
Opinions rise and opinions fall
At the end of days
The trident stands tall
With limitless range
Illuminates all
Answers to no one
Certain and bold
It makes us
Stick to the cause
The wear and tear
Of agony stretched
It makes us
It makes us stick to the cause
The dustcloud left
From a charging bull
Broken bones and bridges burnt
Fuck them all
It never stops
The Sign of the Trident
Stands paramount, eternal and tall
With tears in our eyes
Above them all
Answers to no one
Certain and bold
It makes us
Stick to the cause
The wear and tear
Of agony stretched
It makes us
It makes us stick to the cause
Nothing, no nothing can challenge this call
Larger than life, soul and sound
Of undying tribal war
The cracking whip
Held by and iron fist
Determined and loyal
A constellation of bright shining stars
Answers to no one
Certain and bold
It makes us
Stick to the cause
The wear and tear
Of agony stretched
It makes us

Nocturnal flare - hallow cries
Nocturnal flare
The grave of our kind, lies open to us
And nothing can hold us back
Nocturnal flare - hallow cries

My long suffering friend
We'll be reborn again
Right here where everything ends
Face to the sky
A trail of smoke in the air
Pass into emptiness
New life's awaiting you there
Slave to some wretched old imagination of yesteryear
All that grows in the skulls of the living are flowers of fear
The morning red
A sun god calling you back
Down through a thousand years
White embers whistle and crack
Await the dawn with her kiss of redemption, my firebird!
You were the queen of the souls of men before there was the word
The morning new
The morning red
The fiery promise
Mad swirling smoke
Wheels round her head
Dedication to the queen of souls,
Her lost disciples
And when the fire's work is done
Our time to be reborn
By pagan streams
A wind whips the leaves from the trees
And it is revealed to us
That we are dreams within dreams
Born from some wretched old imagination of yesteryear
Now all that grows in the skulls of the living are flowers of fear
The morning new
The morning red
The fiery promise
Mad swirling smoke
Wheels round her head
Dedication to the queen of souls,
Her lost disciples
And when the fire's work is done
Our time to be reborn
The morning new
The morning red
The fiery promise
Mad swirling smoke
Wheels round her head
Dedication to the queen of souls,
Her lost disciples
And when the fire's work is done
The phoenix now reborn
In darkness
Underneath
The above
Swordbearer
Son of a tornado
He lies in the slumber of dark clouds
Born by a thought
He flies through the thunder of wars
Swirling
Ripping
Ultimate destroyer
Unspeakable avenger
Walker upon the wind
Hunting, piercing
The ultimate, roaring
Walker upon the wind
Son of a tornado
He lies in the slumber of dark clouds
Mourned, feared, adored
Accursed one, torn one, marked one
Ultimate destroyer
Unspeakable avenger
Walker upon the wind
Hunting, piercing
The ultimate, roaring
Walker upon the wind
I gave you a sign
with my bare hands
from the underworld
I drove you around
with no remorse
and now I´m dead to you
You saw my head spin
with your own eyes
I´m not immortal
it´s broken you down
and torn you apart
and now I´m dead
Find me
take me
to the void. To the crooked nest
to Nekrohaven
The bestial screams
a life devoted
to the occult
the flickering lights
my dream came true
and now I´m dead
Find me
take me
to the void. To the crooked nest
to Nekrohaven
Now all men weep
in my bare hands
´cause the lion
no longer roars
and now I´m dead
Find me
take me
to the void. To the crooked nest
to Nekrohaven
The winds
Sing their song
And I listen
They always sing
For those who listen
The lonely dark
Morning haze
Mountains who speak
Of time before time
Scattered snow
Hold the fort!
Winter, wake me
Fire, burn me
Fearless with horns
Ageless northern spirit
Faint cries from ocean birds
Rays of light down the valley
Tore me out of my rhythm
Listen
Winter, wake me
Fire, burn me
Fearless with horns
Ageless northern spirit
Introspective and grateful
Winter, wake me
Fire, burn me
Fearless with horns
Ageless northern spirit
To the front!
Stand up!
With heart
Tuned in
Ageless northern spirit
Take me down to the core
Of the innermost deep within myself
Show me and help me capture
The seed of my existance
And understanding of my purpose
Guide me in grasping the nerve
Of my own melody
Golden star
Shining light
With power to dissolve
The most scattered mind
Into a state of contentment
Hunter, warrior
Crawls his way through the universe
Hunter, warrior
The stage is yours
I can no longer rule
Who made who
A few naked trees in an open field?
Or something with a higher purpose
And sense of being
Dance with me
And try moving
To my rhythm
You and I
We can move together, together
Hunter, warrior
Crawls his way through the universe
Hunter, warrior
The stage is yours
I can no longer rule
Make the world spin and heads bow
Know that devotion is our daily bread
Faitful ye, hear me now
The golden star is here
Hunter, warrior
Crawls his way through the universe
I must carry this torch with him
Bring us all together to the finish line
Our hate shall win
Our evil shall grow
To fix itself in young souls
The final war shall we win
And the blood of the good shall fall as rain
Their short souls shall be gathered together
We shall reign over chaos and everlasting night.
We shall forget our feminine absent mothers,
And end all
A kingdom shall raise itself
In the ash of burned homeland
There is only one master ruler
We pay tribute to you Satan the king of the strong
Your time is has come
At last the raging wind of the storm
Makes the tide crack
Makes the ocean overturn a treasure
Has soon frozen every forest pond
And the snow covers every peak
Stripel's warrior stout he was
Who placed his trust in an ancient time
Wanders off to Dead Island rift after his bane
Grand battle
Howling bleakened far-away lands
Over-abandoned and dark earth
And good for fathers who are victorious
The Norwegian ocean's twilight fjord
The journey through the dim is gray
For me it is a shell of forefather's life
Howled bleakened far-away mountains
Into a gray-turned night
I journey over bleakened far-away mountains
And here in the darkness I am abandoned
Soon snow has burdened every branch
Soon King Winter will have conquered earth
Here where the old ones once fell to the ground
To lay the island deserted
And make it clean
Over bleakened far-away mountains
I sojourn into its dim darkman's* words
Over lands where fathers' struggle has been victorious
Where viking swords left a clear mark
Forgotten times on Jotuns path
There over high cliffs and mountains
Has marked it with dust and ashes
From when Alders' herds wandered these grounds.
Here Gandviks Cave trolls stamped forth
In an evil and large goblin-herd
Where rangers found a big wisdom
About the lands forest-life and dark sides
Here on the path who creeps eternally forth
Between banks where they difficult still
Can be seen in the horizon
So great it must have been
To look out over all this
And to wander so alone and free
An autumn evening in cold and light mist
Like many before me have experienced
And many before me have appreciated
But memories are forgotten as time passes by
And little is here that once were
Here like elsewhere leaves have wizened
But fallen down on a collapsed earth
Where dreams and lives have passed away
But maybe between a rock
Or behind an old buch
Sits still
And waiting
Every tear is frozen
Our soul is linked
Our hate is bloody
All happiness is gone away
All laughter is gone away
All life shall end in death
In a cold and deserted landscape
Shall the black horde step from
Our lord shall rise
Up for all time, rise his kingdom again
Our struggle shall be rewarded
Our names shall be written
Our minds shall pull the bough
All morality shall be cast away
You want but you die of shame
Now is the time come
Yes break the word of the good
Let us for all time become rulers on this earth
Endlessly you fought on the steppes
Unmercifuly you ravaged in the montains
You took you victories with storm
Cruched your enemies with your hand
Make me your servant
Take me into your army
You lived in the darkness
You wandered in greif
You plundered with steel on horse
A proud and stubborn king
Which conquered each fortress
To so hoist the banner to feast
Attila, king of the Huns
King of warriors, our father
You gathered your strength from the darkness
And on plundering I now with you go
Long there away in darkness
Through treetops there moonlight shines
Long there away in all mist
Inside my soul the black anxiety tears
On the moss-grown stones they show themselves
When night-darkness has fallen
Echoes from their horror-full moanings
Endless you can hear
In the horizon far away
Is glimpsed the talking mist
Hordes of fire ride in a flock
By daybreak they gather by a hidden-away headland
The ice-cold snow
Has come
This time
In everlasting snowfall
Glimmering moonlight drifting up above us
Paths covered with frost leads the way
Black souls now travel through the night
In through the valley of fog
All has blackened
All light has faded away
Pure we now enter the kingdom
Remembering that our tracks will be followed
Surrounded by sorrow's haze
The journey moves on
As a band of corpse-dressed ghouls
We wander the wolverine's home
The breeze takes us over Norwegian marshes
Past every misty hamlet
With the hate in our angry minds
We now leave for never to return
Come young brother
Give us your pure youth
Lay your life in our hands
Fight our war with us
Let our sorrows darken your mind
Let our soul be torn apart
Feel the night wrap itself around you
Forget all love
No tears shall fill your nights
Enter the ring of Brotherhood
No weakness shall be found in your soul
Strength shall wander by your side
Come
Share your hate with us
Leave your weak body
Do not be bewildered by enchanting words
In death lies all power
Follow
Follow us
Through the hall of evil we travel!
Where the inverted cross leads the journey!
From the Omnipotence of darkness!
On the flesh of Christ we spit
Let it rot!
A symbol of disappearance of goodness
A play that is ended
Bring forth our inner anger!
Show the way for our hatred!
Give eternal suffering to God's souls!
In the paradise of evil they are yours!
The echoes of silence sets the hour.
Gagged in the chains of depression, I fall away.
No more I will be bolted fast in the anchor of melancholy.
But finally get my longing fulfilled or leaving.

Did I drink too much from the goblet of lifehope?
Did I take the vanity of joy for granted?
For my battle against the pain of emptiness 
this intoxication of the angst of death,
Is all that is left that is mine.
In my loneliness I still know,
That I have none to thank but myself.
This is why I remain calm,
As the rope is tightening around my neck.
Silent witnesses can not give comfort.
The ordinary man in the assembly of the gravechoir.
Tha land of perdition
I created by my own hands.
This intense attraction to the portals of death
I have as A wandering study of tearful black mass.
Controlled since the dawning of time,
But something I never would let go was the sorrow.
My soul did glow
And my mind did yearn
To get hold of a Christian fuck
In the cold darkness I waited with the wind
It howled as if possessed by the devil
I waited
Ahh, I waited!
Time seemed eternal
But finally I got sight of a poor one
I raised my clenched fist
And screamed
Weak Christian!
Die tonight!
I shall tear your soul apart!
You will feel the poor I was granted from darkness!
Your time has come!
So has your faith's time
so has your faith
Pray for mercy you pitiful fuck
And my laughter shall once again resound
Loud in the cold of the night
Where frost will freeze your last
Tear
Weak Christian!
You died tonight!
With a might blow I cracked your skull
A bloody slaughter
From which voices will forever resound in the Kingdom of darkness
Through timeless, decayed dreams
In a moist autumn wind over deserted plains
Against Sorias mountains
I come, a Devil's Knight
Smooth is the rune on the high mountain
Washed away by rain and winds
Enchanting force of evil lurks
Here at Trollhome's moudly gate
Perplexed by the dark building
Made of stolen gold from the pact of light
Used as mockery to make their walls fall
We ponder over this kingdom
So beautiful, filled with timeless dusk
As a star in the gorge of emptiness
Brings forth a nightly wondering
Over thoughts from a long gone time
Straight to the sky it is erected
From the endless black memories of time
Storm blown out of the black inner
Has rock rolled from heath to bottom
Wondering and anxiety gather in the night
In the darkness looming about the spire
For no day knows the way here
No light can sneak in
Where sorrow has conquered all joy
And built a land on human's earth
Filled with ice-cold splendor and glory
Step on to my throne pale corpse
Fall to your knees in respect before my feet
Accept my cold kiss on your forehead
I've laid the path leading to hell
Lift your swords for battle,
Proud men
Let the massacre begin today
Decapitate every Christian
And rape their women and children
Every Christian cross you find, you shall turn
Every building under God's name shall burn
Every Christian man's grave shall be desecrated
Every night you shall awaken human beast
And feel the blood burning like fire inside you
Every night you shall rave like a mad in the streets
And annihilate every sign of life
Hear my speech human beast
My words are your future
I am the embodiment of Satan
I am your master
I am evil
I am Antichrist
In the darkest of darkness I intone
In my halls silence steps forth
Fallen angels are guarding my gates
In the beauty of valley of death
My soul has gone astray
While darkness and sorrow ruled
The fire of hate was lit
In the black silence of the night
My silence self steps forth
In the darkness a corpse burns
Another black soul has returned home
In silence we observe the journey
The journey of our sorrow-black brother
And no tears fall
When ashes are united with dust
We shall all share his fate
We shall all follow our friend
When the bells of judgementday chimes
We shall all return
To rule
A proud knight returns home
From heaven to heaven on a self-made bridge
From the endless battle against the pries of light
And now he shall rest
See into the inner of the mountain breeze
Where its life has sought shelter for a sun
Which in end will go dark with the eternal night
And prevent our world from blooming and growing
See the satire of the eye
Where remains of good is chased away
And is blown away in an open grave
Until the last light has been put out
With powerful blows to human's heads
The knight rejoice in a dark mist
High as the sky, wandering over his own star
Glaring at a world covered with ice
Over innumerable fallen man
Who sowed the growing seed of life
He wanders away from the last war
The might prince, the bloody thorn
Devoted are we
To the emperor of the dark
The power of the almighty
Which leads our minds
Into battle
Against the good and their lies
Though the enemy's army is poor
It is big
But we shall take them all
Gather them up
One by one
The hope they saw in God
Shall I disappear in an ocean of thorns
The thorns their fake messiah
Once felt nailed to his skull
Heaven shall be torn
And a fucking thunder
Shall boulder and roar
His powers will go weak
Where the front of dark
Conquer the plague of light
Eyes will run in sorrow
When they realize that their god
No longer can help
The hope they found in God
Is gone and so it shall be forever
Now they follow their fake salvator
Who still carries a crown of thorns
But king he never became
The stench from the mysterious way,
Where preach and false hopes are bait.
Pierces through like a gift of bitterness,
And fertilizes the human rot.
Like a slave in the state of impotency,
Advises nothing but confession of defeat.
Retreat!
You are not worthy the gift of life.
Retreat!
You are not worthy the gift of life.
Because if the sign of the animal and the idol is ignored,
Great punishment will eventually come to the guilty.
This pious pact's harmful inbreed,
Seeks shelter in the garden of Eden.
Where a proud, pure and upright master
Is not as easily pleased.
So when the thunder of armageddon finally roars,
Can man's fantasy image be shown.
Every man with god-fearing hunger,
Will lose face and be devoured.
Daylight has finally reached it's end
As evenfall strikes into the sky
Far away in the dark glimpsing moonlight
Sickening souls cry out in pain
Whispering voices summoning screams
Waiting for Satan to bless their sins
Blackhearted angels fallen from grace
Possessed by the search for utter darkness
Hear the cries from the Mourning Palace
Feel the gloom of restless spirits
Hear the screams from the Mouring Palace
Feel the doom of haunting chants
Eternal is their lives in misery
Eternal is their lives in grief
Abandoned in a void of nothingness
A chain of anger, a fetter of despair
In this garden of depraved beings
This unsacred place of helpless ones
Satan blessed the creatures
Inswathed them in endless night
Whispering voices, summoning screams
Waiting for Satan to bless their sins
Blackhearted angels fallen from grace
Possessed by the search for utter darkness
You have returned to the torture-chambers
To find peace among the rotting corpses
You have returned to the execution place
To inhale the smell of blood
Death and terror rules the land
We have been spellbound
You have returned to the hidden graves
Only you know about
You have returned to to face your victims
And feel sensation of violence once again
Death and terror rules the soul
You have been spellbound
By the Devil
Murderer, you have returned
To create fear and sorrow
Death and terror rules the land
We have been spellbound
By the Devil
By the light of the moon
And the beings of the night
A curse has been laid upon us
To seek and tear celestial gloss to pieces
By the power of death
And the shadow of the reaper
A call has been brought upon us
To complete the infinite fall of heaven
Without the wit or will to end this journey
We continue travelling towards our faith
Harvesting helpless Christian spirits
Raping the sanctity of saints
The heavenly father is stretching his hand
Pathetically begging for mercy
We spit and piss on his sacred flesh
As we breathe the breath of the unholy
For with the sign of the pentagram
Hellfire rage is for us to come
As we shall wander the pit
Unhallowed by the infernal one
We are forever captured
By the embrace of death
King of tempests and storms
Lord of innumerable figures and forms
Blessed with thy cold I am
As I upon the shoulders of mine
Bear the burden of Thine
Once I got touched by a fire from beyond
An invitation to darkness of which I could not resist
Caressed by the feathers of the fallen
I took the fate in my hand
My raging Commander
My constant Shade
My soul's Persecutor
My eternal Divinity
Revealing Thy powers in visions and dreams
Invoking your magic at night
Honoured I am to mission Thy word
Within a creed is sworn of majestic might
An infernal allegiance in which I pay my share
An unholy awakening inside of which I intend to bear
Beholding Thy commotion
I entreat You with devotion
I subsume Your might with strength
I will carry on with You as my guardian
Against the lambs of the light
Possesses by the true god of earth I am
Possessed for eternity
A scarlet sunset
The threshold to nightplay
A sinful oath is to be sworn
A beckoning bloodlust
Among the seekers
Tyrannic hunger yearns
A gathering in flames and fires
Devil's daughters dance
Scourged in filth obscene and lewd
Longing to dark desires
The nocturnal beast appears
In an evil despotic shape
Expectant watching gracelessly
Before demanding the sluts of lust
Come forth harlots, let's begin!
Rise and give praise in front of Me
And receive eternal life from Me!
Welcome my spirit in honour of Me!
So drink of the blood I provide you
And you shall all forever wander in
The shadows of death
Oh yes, Master! Let us receive
Thine offer and drink with thee!
And become a part of Thy realm
With lust, sex and sodomy
For we are those who seek life eternally
Blood is life and it shall be all ours!
I could drag you to my chambers
And strip you naked in darkness
I could pull your fingernails out one by one
And rape you till you find no hope
I could rip your guts out
And let you watch me
Sacrifice your unborn child
I could leave you to starve
And even bring you to total silence
but I won't
For I find no pleasure in your physical pain
I want your Christian soul to crumble
Your fucking soul
When I have seen your church go up in flames
And you are weeping I will laugh
When I have seen you mourn over loved ones
I will feel bliss when your mortal soul is in ruins
I will grin in the shadows
For that gives me pleasure
tormenting a Christian soul
Soul on departure six six six
Onward onto another existence
A trip far beyond all pleasant dreams
A voyage through desolation sights
Inner transformation
Subconscious flight
In the glance fields of fires
In the distance meadows of might
Where minds being enshrouded in a complete night
The fading of love, life and light
Wandering an endless journey
Dead within a trace
Entering a lost dominion soulless and free
Visiting a foreign place but yet so known
Another dimension opens for me to see
Heaven sure ain't made for me to be
Soul on arrival six six six
One short step from unhallowed ground
The ground of a Kingdom Come
Dead spirits communion
Unorthodox profane void
Gardens, temples, palaces
I have seen them all
In search for insanity, sanity slowly drowns
In trance
Master of disharmony
Welcome my tainted soul
Take me from the hordes of the living
Into the blessed darkness
Master of disorder
Take my impure flesh
Lead me unto the path of temptation
Save me from cowardness
Master of sin
Take my cursed heart
Bring me where I can find salvation
For I am the damned
Master of death
Take my pitiful life
I am enslaved
I shall never forget the pain
Master of sin
Take my cursed heart
Bring me where I can find salvation
For I am the damned
Master of death
Take my pitiful life
I am enslaved
I shall never forget the pain
He became the swarm, indeed a pitiful imitation
To the verge of a quiet glance, an oracle without eyes
Darkness
My precious companion, even thou cant see his face
Salvation turned to bleed despair, compassion fled
Sadistic delight flowed, like Hell burned brighter
Existence woven into darkness, prudence did fall
In Satan's beauty, life was found
A flow of orgasmic fire, swept through the cosmic night
I enthroned darkness triumphant, with the searing trident of the Inferno
Gaze towards the Heavens, an you might catch a glimpse of Me
Illness and plagues, torture and blight
Is what she brings
Mocking holy standards, deceiving feeble fools
Is what she loves
Granted with powers, gifted with magic
Watching the world through raven eyes
Damned woman mischievous whore
Heretic princess
Devil's own
Her seductive elegance
Excites your weak flesh
Her diabolical beauty
Enchants your bewildered mind
You damn woman
You mischievous whore
You heretic princess
You are Devil's own
A serenade made out of black magic
She has learned to set souls afire
And makes sure that you never
Will leave it's trance
Her diabolical beauty
Enchants your bewildered mind
Glowing eyes, staring eyes
Manifest of evil presence
With entities swept in disease and decay
A fall from paradise beyond redemption
Wrathchild's afterglow
He who speaks of nightly treasures
He who wraps the serpent around my neck
He who pours poisonous wine in my chalice
He who lets me serve and slip away
and so i will take shelter
In the absence of the light
Hiding like a masked miniature in the dark
A revenant without relief it seems
For the art of becoming a progeny
and to be raised in such curse
Is to forever creep among naive mortals
Infesting the dead in herdes
His grandeur of guidance in roundtrips obscure
He who immerse my hands in sullen thrills
His paths on wich domination linger
He who dares to prove the sanity of mine
He who speaks of nightly treasures
He who lets me serve and slip away
Black unearthly void creatures crawling
Forbidden forgotten fairly underrated
Bastards in the shape of angels holding my hands
Passing me what is left of the wine
A mental inner vortex
as possessions through a wolf's eye
Envisioning the eclipse
No longer to be blinded by a sunrise
In this final benediction
Confronted by mirages of imminent mortality
Time's set to end the suffering
So follow, I will cherish the secrecies of hearts
Chased by the black sheperds
Behind the curtains of night
Been found as a tool in their seduction
Fatal haze
An escape into abomination
Perished to phasma
Asindrome of another aeon
Soul-obsequial inhesion
Resurged in torrents of abyssmal thoughts
Lost in a helix, blackest might
In stealth i do seek deliverance
In phantasmagoria, vortex utopia
When the ghastly mourners awakens from sleep
And the volant funeral crows are watching
Like evil omens in shadowed murmur
They welcome me again
Agonized and flattered to once become
A part of this horror scenario
I descend with arms open wide
Armoured and filled with painful pleasure
Reflecting streams of monstrous mirages
I will not hide
Losing control in seductive madness
Spiritual revelations, apocalyptic hypnosis
Dead colours appear within unshallow graves
Alone in awe I face abhorrence below
Trapped inside to suffer in silence
Torn apart in mind and sense
Baptized in this nightly glamour-
Rites of splendid essence
Agonized and flattered I once became
A part of the horror scenario
Armoured and filled with painful pleasure
I did not hide
Now when the gates are no longer shut
I withdraw from the light of the sun
Unfolding her carnal desires to me
With tempting eyes she does receive
A hunter of the night devil's whore
May her cursed beauty haunt me forever
We embrace the madness gathered as one
Mourning dead passion
she comes to me
A fate awaits us in the night
In the ruins of creation we will unite
Unfolding her carnal desires to me
With tempting eyes she does receive
A hunter of the night devil's whore
May her cursed beauty haunt me forever
She comes to me
a shining beacon
Confused by the sensual innovation
Passion 
towards the image of mortal evil
Passion
embraced by the image of united death
The enigma lies broken
Searching for those precious moments
Reaching for a higher state of existence
Like a newborn migrant in the void
I am smitten by the forbidden fruit
Possessed by moments of dark splendour
To walk the nightmare terrains forever
The enigma lies broken
Possessed by moments of dark splendour
To walk the nightmare terrains forever
United with new unhallowed grace
This cursed beauty haunts me forever
Erotic and dreamlike still in its mortal disguise
A passionate ritual in the ruined gardens theatre
The painted angels
Shadowed high above
Once they gathered to worship at the picture of me
Like a whisper where there are no words
Appears the perplexed
The statue of might
In the cradle of the next generation
A spiraling ruin
Lost in the gathering dust
the faces you saw in the withering garden
I witnessed the flickering
made to look like stone
Quivering like little figures lost in broken flames
Never to forget again the names carved in horrid flesh
Those words drawn in water
Become our legacy of fantasies
Burn the pictures
So unexpected in this strange deserted place
Once opened its secrets would become the world
Its attributes would continue to unfold forever
Through the fabric of the promised future aeons
I offer this suffering of my unwanted father
and the stars did wander
Separated in the forbidden universe
With hearts of midnight, brightened by His infernal light
We stand as a monolith of wrath, united under the goat of a thousand young
Two horns thrust upwards in defiance, three inverted as the trinity denied
A phalanx of mourners in black, falling towards nightly terror
Unleash the tempted beast, raised your horns in prideful blasphemy
I'll be your guide into the glorious darkness, and enchant you like a taste of sin
Unleash the tempted beast, chant theron in words of blazing scorn
Grant me my dark desires, strengthened through the power of Satan
Take pleasure in the torment of the wretched
and rejoice in the delight of the flesh
Behold the face of Satan
and walk the fields of erotic fire
Hunt the heavens
Godless temples beckon
Through gleaming scapes of horrid nightmare
Gathered between symbols and signs
A glow of new light is born out of the night
Give into your lust and carnal desires
In twisted blood-dripping ecstasy
In the name of Satan
I lead you into temptation
Passenger on confessional course
Unlock with the key you behold within
Repair the shadow of your mind and come awake
Oh, dreadful angel of mine
Enrich me with the vastness of being
Rigid father, teach me how to comprehend
I'll commit myself to understand
To be faithful and the instrument
So that the ones with blindfold can see what I have seen
That there is nothing in between
For I am the accomplice
Aghast and tender, indulged in sin
Embraced by loneliness, legions who grin
I blunder into the realms of slumber
I collide with the obscure
And see the last fraction of light go by
Plundering the sanity from the insane
And providing appearances in black
Carefully swept in decadent spheres
But faces in this world always remain darkened
In circles of dominance, emotional deeps unite
Fiction and transcendence woven together
In the essence of purity lies wisdom
Join the forces, the spiritual black dimensions
What more do you need of proof
Human hands conforming cloven hoofs
For I know the secrets and lies behind all truths
Knowledge is power and the power is mine
It's all mine
So let the children come to me
And share the limitless ways to infinity
Escape death and disease
And behold youth and vitality
Oh, dreadful angel of mine
Enrich me with the vastness of your being
Rigid father, teach me how to comprehend
I'll commit myself to understand
For I am the accomplice
In the shadows of my gallow
I'd rather absent the hallow
For Thy presence made pleasure of pain
and Thy madness turned sanity into vain
Profoundly wicked owner of souls
The mysteries of Thy creation beheld by ghouls
Diabolically disguised heavenly bodies
and its atrociously desired primordial elements
Plunging through the confused heart of sulphur
In all this darkness, how can man see
Pour misguided fool
It is not God you are talking to
I am not impostrous, hiding behind pearly walls
However, I am still yet to be found, known
I shall guide you on your midnight-ride as the sun fades black
and beyond your grotesque imagination
my name will be revealed
The blod of Christ can't heal your wounds
Give me all of yours, and I'll give you mine
I am the hidden fantasy
In the secret of my knowledge
There is no God but me
In this shadowy world all are nameless
Outstanding, dresssed in majestic splendour
Touched by the flames of eternal fire
How I long for your embrace, uttermost desire
In perplexed dementia, where sanity is my vanity
With honour bear the mark of Satan
Triumphant beast in heaven defeat
Disguised in gloom, wear the mask of Satan
Ride the beast through paradise
Still vipers these mortal burdens
We arise as the portals take form
I leave my feathers again
Infidels and scarecrows all fallen from heaven
Captured by the sin of the beast
Mesmerized in total chaos
Engulfed in an overflow of selfish might
Swept through arcane mysteries
Forlorn in a maze of torment
Raped by the sanctity of the unholy
Reveals a Hell I never dreamed of
Bewildered by the arcane lifeforce mysteria
I shed my skin once again
In massing darkness we stand united
Raging above inferior sheeps
A convoy of souls swept into the night
Hearts strengthened with black fire passion
In us is fulfilled the prophecy of satan
Evolution of the inner shrine
In us is mantained the revelation of satan
Innocence brought to an end
In honour of thy unearthly creation
We bring forth thy divine form
Vanity throughout any conceptions
Blazed and bound for the days are coming
Infernal madness, unholy ascendance
Christian death abound in mouring perversion
Cherished sacred icons torn to pieces
They'll chase the serpent in everlasting nightmare
Disharmonic illusions of strings bending loose
Wrapped,penetrating skin
Listen to the music of their agony
Eyes made of glass, mirrors within
Infected by invalid behaviour
While capturing the stench of divine putrefaction
Confess to slavery for the world saviour
Give praise and inhale the corruption
The Enfeebled provides the fool
The Disabled provides the tool
The Apathetic demands the affection
To those suffering from their own satisfaction
Devour in self-deceit, conjure the righteous plague
Testify today's contradiction, glorify tomorrows deed
Inconceivable moral priest, hide in preferable dress
Invite to another pleasure feast, the concealment of joyful laughter
The decrepit innocence of your correctness and well-chosen
Elicits the source of the need for immediate forgiveness
Submit to no grace but the spiteful of your disease
Apply to join the unlimited disgrace and a settlement in the skies
And turn the confusion among your children into self-stimulation
The incarnation of your prostitution, the true Evil in disguise
With the ignorance from your cross as the witness
The truth of your tragedy make you justice
In your mirror the high spirit of kindness
Looks like malice
Condemnation of life by the living dead
What a premature judgement, contradiction to the core
How unfortunate I am, cursed to spend time on a battle already won
The shame that will be guarding your grave says it all
Retreat to the crypt and make it worthwhile
Recall my sins furthermore but still be watching yours with a smile
Incarnated marvels simplified
Effects from such a disconsolate kind
Impotence of the once so perfect living
Erase and rewind
Stand rigid for the next battle
Peace means reloading your guns
The love for life is all hatred in disguise
A carnival creation with masks undone
In search for the guidelines to the gateways of sin
through mires of misanthropy with wrath in mind
Sophistication as cruelty and perfection as virulent truth
Confidently dawned, to pick the best of enemies
An abyss womb stretched wide open, exposed to retaliate
With the stigma feasting upon your flesh I wish you well
Thorns from the fountains of fate licking lepered skin
Worshipped by anyone's mass on our planet hell
What on earth possessed you
Consuming illusions made from hysteria and swallowed tongues
Devoured by doubt, conducting arts of misconception
Testimonial sufficiency declaring numbness of all perceptions
Glance into the blackness hidden beneath your surface
And enjoy the suffering, sanity drained in disrespect
With such bedevilled faith in good, subsequently trusting evil
Next step for mankind will be the last seasons in sin
Left are the kings of the carnival creation
Carrying out the echoes of the fallen
Sense the withering eternity as it fades away
The ultimate graceless voyage of all times
Only death will be guarding your angels, silently
Cripples joining arms in clamour
Institutionalized for the rebirth, the herd will be hunted
The apparition of two faces in disgust
Invisible but yet so clear
Reflections seen by a fugitive
Trying to escape the looking glass
Blood runs from open wounds of false flesh
The one in front of the mirror exceeds the image
Eager to leave further but chained still
To crumble into such nothingness
A despairing fate, for your lies
To pretend is the lunatic's legacy
Privileged to bolt the nails of heresy
Born lifeless into a world of coma
As the chronic sufferer trapped in paradise lost
Missing insinuations of what life was meant to be
Angels and demons, a march man's bewildering hosts
The charlatans and deceivers walk the line in prejudice
The narrow slits the veins in search for the crown
Profound impatience makes the blind struggle in stupidity
The paradox of the daily prayer, diffidence is Confiteor
Phenomena of ironies, cast the litany aside
How intelligible, blessed be the forgetful
Holding the banner high, unrestrained
Slowly abandoning the surface in contempt
Still in costumes to please the ways of living
Witnessing the details of defilement, intoxicating
Make sure to be pleased with the ways of your death
For in days of reckoning and when the twilight torn is ticking
Elysium is halfway and as an answer to the plea
You're destined to yield fragments of Hell in return
Leave unnoticed with the perfect conscience
With the strength of the spiritual eye
Spirits of the token unchained and free
Recover from the philanthropic macabre frenzy
The pale dove grins, black at heart ready to flee
Demon to some, angel to others
A dismal universal hiss, the sound of public scorn
The brush that sweeps across the spectral fields
This landscape is not without a sense of epic wonder
A vast scale that places this sprawling underworld
Into a realm of frames
With a blood-storm fading into the distance
Floating without directions over this smouldering landscape
Caught in a moment of transformation
These shades of anatomic malignant nature
Approached on another in an unpleasant way
Frozen in the act of speech, desperate to express it's state
Created in a shape to accommodate a wide variety of demonic forms
The realm of the benighted aristocracy of evil most pure
This is where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep
Emerged from the depths of the earth gasps
It rages against mankind, to annihilate the earth and worse
It spills the blood like rain, the beauty of death it represents
Devouring their flesh with a razorblade smile
Genes would still blindly carry on smouldering ember of hell
Limned with gold leaf, the scarlet brush
That sweep all traces of time, place and pattern
Total death in every nation
Monuments of vanquished civilization
Just as brilliantly removed ruthlessly eliminated
The cornerstone of human emotions
Has now been drained away
I saw death of a most uncommon nature
We do away with your kind
Countdown to exterminate the human race
Let chaos entwine
On defenseless soil
Remove errors of man
And sweep all the weakening kind
I am war, I am pain
I am all you've ever slain
I am tears in your eyes
I am grief, I am lies
Bygone are tolerance
And presence of grace
Scavengers are set out
To cleanse the human filth parade
I am pure, I am true
I am all over you
I am laugh, I am smile
I am the earth defiled
I am the cosmic storms
I am the tiny worms
I am fear in the night
I am bringer of the light
Earth successfully erased.
Oh, look at those lifeless leaves
All their precious pride is taken away
A lost creation for a graven image
Trembling of nothing but their own fear
On behalf of water made to wine
Elements of deception must entwine
Righteous greed and derangement divine
Vacuum is given to the blind
To surrender to a faith so fake
To not comprehend while you're awake
Thrive on your deity for heaven's sake
Do loose your battle before actual birth
For some sheep need the company of a shepherd
To face the scorn of the earth
Existential parasite drama across the lands
What a relief never bother the why's
Investing illusions and folding hands
The passion for mankind's ignorance feeding you lies
All those naked faces, empty shells
Procreation of the mind put to rest
Crippled and caged, anaesthesia adjust
The lambs of slaughter preoccupied in disgust
Ride the vortex winds with the beast inside
Cast down all memories from a past and future world
The cynic icons and the cryptic writings
As a picturesque creation in force and spirit
Against their reason and will, it is time
Give darkness it's passion plea
The venomous tongue
The inevitable poison
Paralyze the angels
Freeze the forgiven
Baptize in fire
Unleash the devil at heart
Unleash the maelstrom mephisto
So sinner, mourn well
Make all the swans suffer in hell
The maelstrom of the mephisto left the trace
To revel and feast in undelivered grace
Pledged to judgmental arrogance in
Drawn principles of ignorant falsehood
To comprehend that the sin of life is life itself
A tyranny in torment, an inner-sanctum stealing sleep
In the dimness surrounding the towers of the castle
Where the ravens spread their wings out wide
Dwell in depths of the darker self at any shore of infinity
And watch the relentless paint the soil black
What is being formed echoes throughout eternity
As the painter chooses color no more
Hold your shadows close when the comedy is over
As the days of mourning seem to be the days of joy
Fragments fell from the sky in order to penetrate the eyes
A convict wallowing in a lifetime of lies
As cyclones detach from the world above
And all the other worlds beneath them flow
Time winds caressing the dust of cold memories
Sought, to strive in twilight mist and penal fire
As daylight suffers, night time recollects
For what wind hath drawn near, so near:
Death has a contract on life and hell in-between
What was once not certain is now foreseen
When the pendulum is in it's reverse factor
Rivers run red and skies turn black
Accuracies of bloodbaths liberate from within
Conquests of a crooked cross and its coming loss
A magisterial maintenance of diabolic education
Where the opposite of innocence paves way for intelligence
Where pearls are chained for each tragic event
The glorification of deviance in progress
Liars in wait tries to quench their thirst for more
Drowning victims of a parallel universe
The scum of the earth, a rejoice of fouls
The world hates you for being precise
Chains of despair
Cloaked by darkness
The thundering echoes of great destruction to come
Mankind's mysteries
The dying world
Madness in it's sweetest form
What shrivels and dies must face the tempest
The angelic heaven bows to the ultimate truth
And melancholy grew
Anticipation mender through madness
Condemned to the same horrid fate
Insanity applauds
How sharp the awakening
Pale as disease
Mocking
Maddening
Give up the ghost
Cease the gloomy awakening
History foretold
The hidden stigmata
Totally annihilating the ecstasies innumerable
Materialize the vision
Give up the ghost
Cease the gloomy awakening
Thousand different paths
So many sterile ends
I chose the Devil's path
Never shall the sun kiss my face
And caress me with it's burning light
For I dwell in the shadows
And sleep side by side with death
In dark desire I embrace the whore
Giving her an escape from an unworthy life
For with the appearance of the Fallen Angel
I serve Satan
I serve Darkness
I am a prince among the damned
As I've been for eternity
A monarch in a dark paradise
Cursed by life and the living
Oh tremble not my immortal heart
Though you beat in the shadows of death
Eternal life is the blessing
And I shall rule for another thousand years
I blew out the light
Abandoned Jesus Christ
Christian life forms' grief's
We buried their belief's
Waiting for their saviours rebirth
The dawn was soon to come
The dawn would soon be gone
There in that formless abyss was I made
A partaker of the mysteries averse
Welcome to the abandoned land
Come on in, child; take my hand
Here there's no work or play
Only one bill to pay
There's just five words to say
As you go down, down, down
You're gonna burn in hell
Oh, burn in hell
You can't believe all the things I've done wrong in my life
Without even trying I've lived on the edge of a knife
Well, I've played with fire, but i don't want to get myself burned
To thine own self be true, so i think that it's time for a turn
Before i burn in hell
Oh, burn in hell
Take a good look in your heart; tell me what do you see?
It's black and it's dark, now is that how you want it to be?
It's up to you; what you do will decide your own fate
Make your choice now for tomorrow may be far too late
Hear no evil, don't you
See no evil, don't you
Lay no evil down on me
You're gonna burn in hell
Speak no evil, don't you
Think no evil, don't you
Play with evil, 'cause I'm free
Cuddled through a cold womb he was
Pitch black and without sunshine rays
Hell patiently awaiting him on blood spilled soil
A noble grief stirred heart, always ready to die
In sinister systematisation, submission is golden
As an apprentice to violence, slaughter and bloodshed
He was like an object that is being processed
A force-fed destructor ready for abomination
The vast solitude in him witnessed it all
Those self afflicting eyes
And their fear painted faces
Made out of utter discipline, failure unacceptable
Hosts to oblivion
Exploring the darkest of places
Stench of rotten flesh breathing down his neck
Every day seemed like an endless night
When would he ever wake from this void
No other voice than his own will ever tell
What was real and where he had been
What he had done
Did you bleed for the cause
Like the rest of his men
Did you capture the euphoria
How it was like to kill
Such a necromantic force behind it all
They sure did battle till the end
But when came all the glory
And who got spared to carry his body
Just pure death and too profound to be shared
Was it all a fabricated vision in his memory
To serve the wastelands of insanity
At the front
Life forever lost its innocence
Never to see the light of day again
He pondered his last few steps
Into the realms of death
With his hands bloodstained
Courage and consistency
Bravery and valor
Honor and pride
For what was it all worth
The battle raged on and on
Fuelled by the venom of hatred for man
Consistently, without the eyes to see
By those who revel in sewer equally
We, the prosperity of the future seal
Cloaked by the thunders of the north wind
Born to capture the essence of
The trails of our kind
Zero tolerance must be issued forth
Behind the enemy's line
So it shall be written
And so it shall be done
Discover and conceive the secret wealth
And pass it unto your breed
Become your own congregation
Measure the sovereignty of it's invigoration
We, who not deny the animal of our nature
We, who yearn to preserve our liberation
We, who face darkness in our hearts with a solemn fire
We, who aspire to the truth and pursue it's strength
Are we not the undisputed prodigy of warfare
Fearing all the mediocrity that they possess
Should we not hunt the bastards down with our might
Reinforce and claim the throne that is rightfully ours
Consider the god we could be without the grace
Once and for all
Diminish the sub principle and leave it's toxic trace
Once and for all
Annihilate!
The commotion breeding the perverse
For bloodbath is on your doorstep
A mass impending threat
The perfection of religion
Becoming our death
Do not respond blindly
To growing gardens in decay
Stand guard when visitors fall silent
Blow the candles out, end the road here
No solace will be found
Within elements of the tribe
When covered with filth from all sides
Compassion will fail
Their promises are honored
In a mind controlled state
The absence of reality, reason and logic
Prove failure of faith
Enriched by the presence of it's clarity
Darkness descends, everyone dies
For wisdom aligns in our favor
Illuminated before our eyes
Uncover!
A new beginning, the inevitable dawn
Justice will be given where justice is due
And guide the righteous ones
Back to the final resting ground
To perceive the truly hellbound
Demonstrate superiority
A grand gesture of liberation need no judge or jury
Demons rate inferiority
Scatter the remains of the prey
Rise up
Let us fight
The thought away from our backs
And seed
On a cursed land
A lineage of pain
Then to burden
The of the merciful
Who believe in
The bread of the soulless
For the faith you posses
Is nothing but disgust and arrogance
And your need for knowledge
Is an abundance of mockery and desecration
The pain in my heart is not thirst
For a heavenly body
Nor is the failing search for angelic power
It is the fire and it burns
It's just that you
Are in its way
Take part in the shadow of guilt
Please your soul with the wonders of sin
For where will you be
When the lamp is extinguished
But death comes not
With our message
Reverberations from the splendid inheritance
Will redeem the eternal corruption
Bring judgement over heads other than your own
Where you hide your shame in songs of praise
Then you shall taste the fruit
Of your own passing away
Like a flock of hellspawns
And stewards of the son of despite
We parry their guile with the magnificence of disgust
By the evidence of our heavy burden
Lies their mind drowning
Left dessicated without power
Let us sit by and watch
Death and destruction's devotees revel
Let us sit back and witness
Innocent semen being poured
Into the arms of Armageddon
Let it pour, more and more
Pure fucking Armageddon
Let it pour more and more
Reason faithfully defiles
On bloodstained hands
Where graceful motion
Are lost arts
There are only battles to be lost
In the kingdoms of the blind
For those who seek salvation
In the dust of the earth
Will only find wrath
In the sands of time
Engulfed by the desert
We taste death in the dry heat
The disciples of prophetic ablution
Had sworn to let the skeptics bleed
For great are their love for warfare
Henchmen of the disastrous creed
Watch us all celebrate in their name
The lambs of our time being slain
Awaiting the final perdition
Defeat against all and everything
For whatever adorned righteousness
Justice never wait for the guilty to speak the truth
For mankind so hated the world
That it gave all it's begotten sons and daughters
That whoever believed the lie
To perish and receive everlasting hell
Man and his faithful ethics
Intoxicated by the fruits of the earth
Diabolical fanatikism, so cold and grim
The perfect perversion, bestiality incarnate
As instruments of torture
And leaving no room for sympathy
We bring forth the monstrous birth
To the worlds light
As all great art is made from suffering
So are we
Good in nature, but evil by our own free will
Incestuously created by the will to kill
Time is here to walk the final abyss march
Bound to the force of the last holocaust
Pour free the gifts of grace
And slaughter the entire human race
Not permitted to redemption
When pain rises high in purgatory
A reality so convincingly justified
Feeding from Death Cult's gown
We bring forth monstrous birth
To the worlds light
Unclean is the unfolding and thought of the act
Without limitations in unknown ecstasy
Nor a justified wish of giving birth to offsprings for God
Voluntary infected and soaked with acid
In fleshy sweetness
Imprisoned by lies and disobedience
Man's fragile behaviour
Must be strained with honor and glory, it's told
But goodness brought nothing but eternal evil
When the tyrant of Eden granted the fruit
Wisdom is freely enriched in the multitude of the Beast
When heaven's glorious injustice
And pompous mercy
Invokes discardment as we are seen
The spark has started a fire
And suffering in the will of pestilence
The pathetic slaves kneeling in shame
Born with sin and mercy
Descendants who swear the oath
With a promise to undo the peace
To crush the richness of heaven's slaves
And triumph in coldness in honor of the Beast
The chalice of wrath is flowing over
Strengthened by rioting devils' sulphur winds
Glowing, from the region of Belial's children
Bred beyond the defying mountains of indignation
The last signs of Christ's losing angels
Burning inexorably in the fire of the raven
Painful and pale is death
With haematemesis from the guild of light
Death's presence spares no one
The devout life is suffocated by its own tongues
The most precious soil is garnished
With poverty and hunger
Wings spanned over Darkness' deep abyss
Brought to life to devour
With pestilence and death
Indulging on sin and whorery
The supremacy of the bastards of the pole
Finds pleasure in the hierarchy of sin
An eternal life in paradise
Is perfection in Satan's dynasty
Are you born from the abyss
And have you sought the creed
That drape the shadows
Of your own thought?
Is your heart mesmerized
By the fire that burns forevermore
And do the secrets from the flames
Hold the mysteries over which you preside?
Reveal the infantile wound and regain strength
Free your spirit from those who lead in praise
Recollect the anger and the hate
For not shall your morals dissolve in pity
Righteous warmth accompanied
By deceitful tongues
Stay away from processed promises
Let them fear what you know
A malicious smile on their lips
To keep us all under control
Now it's time to rise and demand our due
The whores and their illusions left us bitter and cold
Drench them in their own poison, spit back the scorn of their ways
Out win their defect morality, and the words they pray
Consolidate the troops and expose the lies in their eyes
The ones deprived from the ecstasy that binds the neglect
Better lead than being led, earn any victory
For you stand superior above the plague and it's mass
The burden of proof rests on your shoulders
As mortal manufactured waste
And part of the commonly infected
You prevent the ones worthy the gift of life
To surface on once a prosperous soil
As superficially bewildered whores
And succumbing to fictional truth
You are taught to preserve and profit
The life institutional lie
You worthless piece of shit
May we all depart from this world
And dissolve into nothingness
Compassion will not be granted
When life's value
Is point below zero
Human depravity is at our disposal
As the perfect tool to destroy mankind
The worst kind of them all
Modern times' ignorance, the world disease
Appeal to death of every man
A living hate smoldering abyss
Nurtured through centuries with quietly exercised wrath
Seeks the easiest way to the feed the engine
Praising the final bloodbath
Uncertainty and guilt
Will no longer endorse our fate
There will be no remorse, we kill to kill again
Killing all
Go ahead end it all, we deserve no better
As a forever unblessed detonation
The great plutonium chord fulminates
Blinding the eyes of creation
Cutting off all life support
Sweeping away existence instantly
Iced desolate ruins linger
Leaving traces of our lovely humanity
The memories far beyond the reckoning
Have begun to lurk in the distance
Like visual objects dearly known
The grace of devils hands
As they walk with me like a medium
When I choose and require a burn-out
Resting in expanded malicious force
Drained for murderous weapons
Knowing where you stand
In the magnitude of this thought
Looking at the spirit of fire and flames
Enduring on the throne of the black heart
A bringer of evil I am
And therefore also a carrier of light
As I use this focus through the dark
And face the sunshine in the dead end
Limitations do not exist
When you are ahead of the crowd
With the art of confidence
I reign at the throne of my soul
The value of this darkness unwinds
Travelling the other path
A hidden triumph
But obvious to the strong and wise
By understanding this reality
I remain in a twice-coloured cloud
With feet connected solid in the ground
And thus I get peace of mind
A bringer of evil I am
And also a carrier of light
As I use this focus through the dark
And face the sunshine in the dead end
Devoted to your own opiate
In escapades from discontentment
Are you shutting off from the outside world
To reflect on your mind shallow gutter?
For this is your empire, this is your intrigue
Here you own them all, here you seal the deed
Contaminated from the spree of self salvation
To keep the fever flowing in the veins
Prominently manipulating heaven and hell
Does your sophistically discreet interlude
Maintain stories not to be revealed?
In your search for redemption
Greed and lies become the savior
Through the lecherous eyes disgust withstand
For are not these the windows to your soul?
Fatherly fornication of sweat lips in dismay
Repeatedly unlocking the vaults to the holocaust
The dormant prodigy seeks it's reason for rebirth
But it will never, never gain the strength
A surrender in superficial scorn
The rape of an ever unborn
Seeds have been planted in the name of the son
Until this day, ungodliness is yet to be gone
Sacramental suicide amidst the flow of virgin vine
The only way to comfort the defeat
Regrets can no longer find it's ways
Streams of innocent bitter tears flowing down the drain
Mirrored in the haze of a partaker's eyes
My descent is the story of everyman
I am hatred, darkness and despair
My descent is the story of everyman
I am hatred, darkness and despair
Evoked and entertained through centuries
Wrathful and sullen
Dormant still
The ferocity pervades everywhere
Waiting to be released at last
Hear my offering
Ye bastard sons and daughters
Share my sacrifice
Share my sacrifice.
My descent is the story of everyman
I am hatred, darkness and despair
Reconcile not with the fear of the snake
But embrace it as your own
Inject its venom into your veins
And replant the seed that gives growth
Still shrouded in mystery
Until you arise above perception
A veil of ignorance is in motion
Continuing throughout generations
A veil of ignorance is in motion
Continuing throughout multiple generations
Let me be the one that deliver you from the deceit
And back into perfect accordance with the laws of nature
The snake is notoriously tempting
But the snake is fair
What is worse than not knowing?
To live or disappear?
The ferocity pervades everywhere
Waiting to be released at last
Hear my offering
Ye bastard sons and daughters
Share my sacrifice
Share my sacrifice
Hence I will anoint
And whisper wholeheartedly
The creed of Hades and beyond
As I succumb to inevitable sin
For I cannot enslave myself
With imaginary words of salvation
The hypocrisy that surrounds my temple
Is assisted by pretenders to the throne
The winds that blow purity
Signify my chosen legacy
I was born to opposition
A contender to creation
For my sins
I will ask no forgiveness
For my sins
They are not to forgive
So never speak of me quietly
Stand by my confession
I voice your rebellion
Against the traitor of the world
I am the first creature of this Kingdom
I will be the One
To out live His time
With the triumph of free will
Fallen I have, Fallen I am
Cursed and destined to burn
Fallen I have, Fallen I am
Cursed and destined to burn
My loyalty towards a liar ceased to exist
Once misled by an empty fraudulent face
I will never turn my back on you
And deceive the flesh of our race
I will always speak truly
So you can understand
No riddles that manipulate
The words and symbols of man
Do not believe false promises
Conspiring to cover up the truth
Find solace in darkness within yourself
And have your legions unleashed
Do not withhold the air
Of your very last breath
In the end of days
You will transcend life and death
Let the one who is fit
Be the King
Of the Heavens above
And all worlds down below
From who or what have I
Received this gift?
For what purpose do I
Seduce this craft?
I know these answers
Lie hidden beyond
The powers that be
The power that is me
I will continue to decipher
And make it easier for you
Behold! Let it be told
Try and understand
That all and everything
Which I have done
I have done for you
I will continue to decipher
And make it easier for you
Behold! Let it be told
What is fiction and untrue
I will not leave you behind
With the burdens of belief
And divine misery
That means restless grief
For it is written
The times of old will come anew
And have the universe reversed to its origin
When the ancient winds blew
Have I not
Been too long in the shadows of invention and creation
As I rightfully behold the flesh
Fear of the conscious mind will have you facing away
My word and world holds ground and is real
Your word is like floods of poisoned water
A language spoken with spit from different tongues
It all seems like an eternity
This battle between us two
Good and evil
Me and you
Time has come to step up
And take back what you took from me
My word and world holds ground and is real
Your word is like floods of poisoned water
A language spoken with spit from different tongues
You can never corrupt me again
Time has come to step up
And take back what you took from me
You can never corrupt me again
I protect every man guilty of sin
The ultimate sin being me
The vapor from the plague
That infested my mind, body and soul
Obscured my view from wisdom
The mist that had me wonder in resentment cleared
And troubles me no more
Vengeance is mine
Neither sweet nor kind
Vengeance is mine
No longer am I held responsible
For the error of your ways
My conscience
Stand defiantly proud and rigid
So take my advice
Meet your opposition
Profane and disciplined
Take back your pride
With a pounding hammer
No longer am I held responsible
For the error of your ways
My conscience
Stand defiantly proud and rigid
So take my advice
As long as my icon has flesh
No one puts me to the test
And as long as my spirit permits
There will be no fucking rest
Vengeance is mine
Neither sweet nor kind
Vengeance is mine
Vengeance is mine
I owe you nothing
But scorn and contempt
From all that is holy
I will have my revenge
Vengeance is mine
No longer am I held responsible
For the error of your ways
My conscience
Stand defiantly proud and rigid
So take my advice
As long as my icon has flesh
No one puts me to the test
And as long as my spirit permits
There will be no fucking rest
With wisdom and fate
I design darkness
You keep feeding me denial and hate
And from that I will create
Arrogance and deception
Torment and bliss
How I envy your lack justification
When mine is so sincered
I sense the darkness
The desire overtakes
My devotion endeavors
Habitation changing course
Repentance oh not
No name or remorse
Will I ever authorize
On this treasured path
I am warm by this fire
And its flaming desire
For what I can not fulfill
My destiny completes
I believe my truth to be
A much greater thing
Than a manufactured lie
Too great to comprehend
Where I come from
There's no higher authority but me
Being my own god
Is all I was meant to be
My eyes got blinded
And conned by the light
Like a fugitive on the run
I sought perseverance in the night
Deceptive icons were finally
Taken out of my sight
As the contender to origin
I will forever unveil His might
They say I am the cancer
On the back of the Inquisition
I may well be the cancer
In the heart of the Inquisition
They say I am the cancer
On the back of the Inquisition
I am the cancer
In the heart of the Inquisition
Through my years of sacrifice
Evolution came with lessons learned
Respect and fear
Is what I earned
So underestimate not your vision
Or you will be taught
Calculate your intuition
And you will teach
You all have been conned
And I always take the blame
For you do not understand
You are all the same
Fear Tomorrow's Adversary
And the wealth of uprising
The final storm will be released
And the unmerciful will erect
Hidden from the eyes of your God
I will proclaim original sin
And have you all purged and purified
From the lies that remain within
Cleansed and draped in sulphur linen
Black and pure since the Beginning
Mercy is not truth
Your sins are next to mine
Mercy is not truth
All your sins are next to mine
My soul's ablaze
Inflamed with rage and isolated
In whirlwinds of hate
My soul's ablaze
Yet camouflaged in the haze
Why did He not see this coming
What did He not understand
One time forsaken
But forgotten I am not
I will win this war
But never the peace
I am my own free spirit
Hence I will not rest
Sparks fly and fire licks my wings
Tied to this wood
I was born for burning
I rebelled against the flock
Declined to submit to slavery
As a token from my legions of the chosen few
I reveal the secrets to the world's most famous forgery
As flames devour my skin
Flesh melting, peeling off
My days as an earthbound entity
Are outnumbered and have come to an end
I will never be laid to rest
But be free from oppression
Those of my kin
the black flame
Those of my sin
hail my name
Those of us that have been given eyes to see
Will never be laid to rest but be free from oppression
In this hour I finally separate
Carnal knowledge from divine will
In this hour I finally separate
Myself from your tyranny
Still our enemies will keep hiding
In the shadows with betrayal against reason
But with my reprisal I shall endure
And uncover the magnitude of this treason
I will arise from perdition
And let me presence known
I will author a new era
And have my Beast shown
My stigma is of damnation
I am from beyond your God
With defiance and resistance
I burn the bridges and their names
Will I ever comprehend
My own spells and games?
Let me keep my world
Let me have my slaves
They all do wonders for me
So I can leave things be
Let me keep my world
As I'm too blind to see
When I lay in bed at night
Wishing well
When I pray for recovery
Feeling hell
Suffocating in my own filth
With no fresh air to inhale
Born treacherous!
Insanity keeps me away and free
From the core of responsibility
But once the pace quickens
I'll be derived from myself
In total mind captivity
The core principle of freedom
Is the only notion to obey
The formulae of evolution and sin
Leading the way
The rebirth is near completion
As we slowly awaken from slumber
The malpractice of the spirit ends
Gateways!
When the gift is once again attained
Gateways!
No rules or restraints are longer valid
Gateways!
When the ancient future is reclaimed
Gateways!
No rules or restraints are longer valid
Gateways
When the ancient future is reclaimed
Gateways
It is all there for the eyes that can see
The blind ones will always suffer in secrecy
For it is the omen of what lies submerged - Breeding
Untouched within us 
Bleeding
The core principle of freedom
Is the only notion to obey
The formulae of evolution and sin
Leading the way
The rebirth is near completion
As we slowly awaken from slumber
To receive the light that shines in darkness
The light that shines forevermore
Be the broken or the breaker
Be the giver or the undertaker
Unlock and open the doors
Be the healer or the faker
The keys are in your hands
Realize you are your own sole creator
Of your own master plan
Be the broken or the breaker
Be the giver or the undertaker
Unlock and open the doors
Be the healer or the faker
The keys are in your hands
Realize you are your own sole creator
Of your own master plan
Old dreams return
Disillusioned I yearn
Am I buried beneath sand and clay?
The caress of cold soil
With limbs crippled to the coil
Locked inside a nightmare womb
Tarnished and grief stricken
Emptiness within a void
Longing for the sun to shine
To discourage the demonoid
Salvation!
Darkness reborn!
We seem to keep fading away
Holding on to that last final sway
A doctrine of self salvation
Darkness reborn on resurrection day?
Stagnating in dead waters
While circling above the surface
Of the deep pale desert sea
Cutting that other life of lines
Salvation!
Wish we'd never met
Salvation!
And rather gone our separate ways
Salvation!
All times spent together
Salvation!
Are the darkest of days
Salvation!
Darkness reborn!
Forces of the northern light
Assemble
Forces of the northern night
Call to arms
Summoned by the secrets of sacrifice
Meeting destiny on the road we took to avoid it
As we only compete with ourselves
Left is that of a confident union
What bridge to cross and what bridge to burn
Deceit is everywhere you turn
We weed out the weak and their weep
Evolving compulsively
Behaving inconsistently
Yet the pulse is pounding
Restoration is the name
For those who are left in the game
Invocation in the name of our flame
The deviants seek but one place
Forward onward march!
Forgive we shall not
Forget we shall not
With trickery and treat
Enemies will face defeat
No place for dreamers
As our formation is lava
Fire is with or against you
And so it burns
Constant retribution calling
From the shadows of three consecutive sixes
Merging with the cold dark vacuum
Talent is worthless unless exercised
When the world is turning
You'll find your true nature
When the first is last and the last is first
You'll be where you choose to be
Forgive we shall not
Forget we shall not
Fire is with or against you
And so it burns
Shedding the old skin
Procreating new sin
Incubation and isolation
A new storm is brewing
Ritualist!
Shedding the old skin
Ritualist!
Procreating new sin
Ritualist!
Incubation and isolation
Ritualist!
A new storm is brewing
Away with obstacles to progress
Those deficient in ambition to prosperity
Yearning but what already is gone
The remains digress
And start anew
Ritualist!
Aligned with the continuum
Ritualist!
Expanding the source at hand
Aligned with the continuum
Expanding the source at hand
Altering the past and the present
The future changes the chain of command
Transfusion of new blood
Congregation of the true blood
With no chains attached
We're letting the past rest
And things will never quite be the same
Transfusion of new blood
Mobilization of true blood
What's leaving is already left behind
What's leaving is already left behind
With no chains attached
We're letting the past rest
Things will never quite be the same
When we are in charge of the game
Dispatching the chained ones
While being watched by the eyes of time
Everything is clearer now
The search is on for the next horizon
Ritualist!
Moving forward with silence and rapid pace
Ritualist!
Since the horror dawned upon our immediate race
Ritualist!
The veil has once again been extracted
Ritualist!
From the mist that dimmed our eyes
Synthetic residue touched upon
Scars and wounds frown upon
While other wounds are closing
Stars and losers reassemble
Within thy own abyss
Sought through internal pyre and wind
Not ready to remember where to begin
For another day is yet to come
Before the night takes us home
What will remain
What will leave trace
While travelling through
Time and space
Arcane perfection
Arcane illumination
Arcane perfection
Sweeps away darkness of the old ways
Arcane illumination
Welcomes the birth of another
Haunting visions dawn upon me
While time is standing still
Lost far beyond the imaginary
Out of reach for the soul
Through moors and mists of deception
The uninitiated are conjoined
Illusive bliss feeds obsession
A feeble orientation is provoked
Inflammatory bonds will be broken
Being the shepherd no more
Yearning for that ever glowing token
In ongoing lore
Images appear before my eyes
At any given time
Burdened bearing all their lies
Leaping laughter and secret smiles
Inflammatory bonds will be broken
Being the shepherd no more
Yearning for that ever glowing token
In ongoing lore
The treasure lies not in regression
But in reaching the levels of becoming
That harboured within us for centuries
Centuries of long lost knowing
Spirit and matter defined
Spirit and matter refined
The upper planes accessed
Insight and co-alliance addressed
Spirit and matter defined
Spirit and matter refined
Dare not to inflict upon my wishes
Dare not to obstruct upon my path
Dare not to pretend to lick my wounds
When all it means is opening another
Purity comes with rebirth
Reassigned through the slit
Spawned out of the shadows
The light is once again lit
False regrets
Deepest of despair
False visions
Reservoir of grief
False regrets
Whatever presence
False visions
That graced my spirit
Whiffs of clarity
And universal understanding
Come and go
I'm too young and too old
To continue this worthless fight
I've seen through the darkness
To understand the value of light
Though I seek validity
From the Ides of March
I watch the darkness
Open its jaws
Whatever presence
That graced my spirit
Is for whomever
I choose to inherit
Ages of the past
Forever to last
Enter the supreme unknown
From within the chambers
Comes expansion of thy own free will
From the outer rooms
Comes extensions of thy own free will
Through the confines of tomorrow
We reappear still
Timeless and elemental
From the ancient future
Comes the seamless and the endless
Ages of the past
Energies eternal
Forever to last
Seeing
Evolving
Willing
Achieving
Beyond the next worlds
Flee the cage of insecurity
Enter the supreme unknown
Expand the inn er and outer horizon
For it is as obvious as it is shown
Can you remember remember my name
As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown
And cold spirits of ice
All my life
I am the echo of your past
I am returning the echo of a point in time
Distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known
And laughing as the spirits appear
All your life
Shadows of another day
And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect Strangers
I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow
A strand of silver hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see
The voice of ages in your mind
Is aching with the dead of the night
Precious life your tears are lost in falling rain
And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect Strangers
I know I must remain
Become through earned
And granted liberation
Rise above the secrecy
And silent deception
Clarity is determined
At the depths of murky waters
The potion of black earthed blood
Is the sludge draining the conscious
Essential learning
Corrupted and drifted
In this deceiving world
The modern savant has ignored the soul
Expose the dreamworld
We all believe to be real
Forgotten, forbidden
All the knowledge that is hidden
In the shadows
Our eyes are blind with confusion
The curtains hide the present
Leaving only rays of disillusion
Expose the dreamworld
We all believe to be real
Forgotten, forbidden
All the knowledge that is hidden
Mired in illusion
Lost in the masters game
Silenced by the idea of time
Nurtured with lies and deceit
The silent seeker, the seer
Travels beyond the veil
The silent seeker, the seer
Fleeing the dense womb of ignorance
To the trained eye
There are no coincidences
The more you see
The less it makes sense
To the trained eye
There are no coincidences
If you can not see
You can not truly know
We are the current sum of all the ages
Leaving a trail of burnt pages
Thrown into darkness as stars
We travel alone as one
When the dust settles on the tavern
Is when we're liberated from illusion
Taking our first and final breath
Realizing life is always after death
The word that has been spoken
Through time and time again
Is the light that inhabits our voice
The light that keeps us aflame
All retrospection is invalid
As we've been fed disdain
Confined to the fence of knowledge
We need to die, die again
To govern thyself
You must know your darkness
To govern thyself
You must know your past
All rise and fall
All is internal
All eternal
All rise and fall
Controlling matter with will
We withstand every storm
In and out of exile
Spirit, matter and form
To govern thyself
You must know your darkness
To govern thyself
You must know your past
Nomads plunging into the vast abyss
Unattached, fleeting through the chasm
Naked in pure darkness
Embracing the new dawn
We are gods here for the taking
Yield to the dragon's embrace
We are gods
Yield to the dragon's embrace
As pawns in this secret game
No one knows nothing
Yet, in the realm of sacred play
Everyone knows everything
A winged and secret flame
Leaving this paradigm
A dimension we are set to flee
We are gods in the making
We are here for the taking
Yield to the dragon's embrace
We are of transcendence
We are wolves and snakes
A winged and secret flame
Leaving this paradigm
A dimension we are set to flee
The arrival is in the departure
We are sculpted into life
By the hands of death
Legionnaires of degradation
Ridden with disease
Disguised as martyrs
Preaching counterfeit peace
Unbound, glory forever untouched
Unbound, from its inception
To its final round
Through the tunnels
Darkness dims the vision
Yet, the light is kept guarded
Secretly
Unbound, glory forever untouched
Unbound, from its inception
To its final round
Risen anew from its humiliation
The fire has been awoken
The crossroads many
The highways few
Through desert storms it flew
The spirit of the phoenix wins
Restored anew
Unbound, glory forever untouched
Unbound, from its inception
To its last final round
Discover with courage
While facing the beyond
Uncompromisingly
Everything connects
As you detach
Truth foretold
Truth discovered
Truth always known
All growth comes at a cost
Moving forward means sacrifice
Enduring all paths crossed
The shadow is your dragon
Making the darkness conscious
Your wings open wide
Old souls becoming of age
Prosperity comes with a price
All growth comes at a cost
Moving forward means sacrifice
Enduring all paths crossed
Truth foretold
Truth discovered
Truth always known
The secrets of existence
Everything's within reach
The beginning is near
The end never draws fear
Undo me
And feel no restraint
Undo me
Pain is wanting closure
Undo me
The mind it needs to rest
Undo me
I shall be restored
Perseverance doesn't mean anything
Unless it's for eternity
The real powers that will ever be
Is freedom and liberty
Undo me
And feel no restraint
Undo me
Pain is wanting closure
Undo me
The mind it needs to rest
Undo me
I shall be restored
A lifetime worthy of awakening
Is a life worth transcending
We learn as we teach
We teach as we speak
We speak as we seek
We seek what we learn
Knowing when to end a journey
Is to recognize where it begins
What we really seek is not here
But on the other side of fear
We learn as we teach
We teach as we speak
We speak as we seek
We seek what we learn
Dead at nothing
Alive at everything
You travel time
And time travels you
As within so without
As above so below
When we set sail
Energy is our procession
The journey inward repeats
The horizon is our destination
Life is the trial
And the passage is death
Storming through oblivion
Life is a trial
And the passage is death
Storming through the veil
The transition from internal life
Repressed and unseen
Forgotten
Lurking in the shadow of your mind
Losing yourself is the key
To leave everything behind
Losing yourself is the key
The shadows become our past
The migration of the soul
Picks up where it leaves the flesh
And enters the finish line
Sustained through another time
Life is the trial
And the passage is death
Storming through oblivion
Life is a trial
And the passage is death
Storming through the veil
As within so without
As above so below
The inevitable exchange
Is when knowledge comes
Without judgement
The final transition
Is when knowledge becomes
The internal
The facilitators of darkness
Are the true providers
To the world's light
Ascending the highest mountain
Beyond the perception of reality
Forever free
From illusion of mortality
Open are all the doors
All will run its course
Leaving the former paradigm
Escalating, further the climb
Ascending the highest mountain
Beyond the perception of reality
Forever free
From illusion of mortality
The flow is ever present
Upstream and against the current
Ascending the highest of mountains
Free
I saw the virgin's cunt spawning forth the snake
I witnessed tribes of Judah reduced to ruin
I watched disciples twelve dissolved by flame
Looked down on son of god snuffed in vain
Blow your trumpets Gabriel!
As I beheld the bewilderment of Eden
Break the bread
and crumb by crumb into the Leviathan's den
Nations fall prey
Hail my return
Tribe of Judah decimate
Hosanna Hosanna
Root of David eradicate
Let wine of Sodom fill our mouths
May Sin of Gommorah grace our hearts
Veto! I vomited forth
From a throat choked by rope
As lunatic mob
Shackled maimed feet
Tore asunder both wings
Pluck my eyes out
Rip my tongue
Make me slave to gravity
Bleed dry of tears
Weep with blood
Leave to atrophy
I sought reprisal high and low
I spew forth plagues to taint their soil
I crept under the shadow ov purity
In my hour of pious wane
I turned to boundless catechism
Behold the anathema of benediction
Sacrilege in Gethsemane manifest
Anointed sin became flesh
Emerge The accuser of all
Hark the universe cries forlorn
Bleeds from black lungs of hell
Deflowered by the horns
And so I reversed the wheel of my fortune
Strike blind the eye of the lion
With every breath stolen from their lips
I raped and raped and raped the daughters of Zion
Raise the dagger Abraham
And slit the throat of thy only son
Reverse the history of man
Fuck and reset the world
Pluck my eyes out
Rip my tongue
Make me slave to gravity
Bleed dry of tears
weep with blood
Leave my cross to atrophy
I believe in Satan
Who rend both heavens and earth
And in the Antichrist
His dearly misbegotten
The anguish of our future
A Bastard spawned from lie
Born of a harlot nun
Reign high in luxury
Aloft the kings of man
I use words sharp as a sword
Three days risen
the grand deceiver
I bless the world with ire and woe
So, can you hoard host like Zion’s coin
Belie progeny of your pain?
Thou, disrupter, imbalance my creations!
Hence I transfix in bliss of flagellation
I burnt in rapture, wafted ash about
Became the law above all laws
In asymmetry of the horns
I cut loose the cord of life
Depart celestial source
Rub mould in holy pages
Let woodworms eat the cross
I prayed I’d die in you Lord
I pray you’d die in me
Who shall crucify the last prophets
And have them wilt on splintered stems?
Who shall churn hells across the earth
And reascend to seat himself
At the left hand of Satan
Be gaoler of the living
And of the dead
As it was in the beginning
Now and shall ever be
World without end
Amen
You alone have suffered.
The fall and torment of shame,
I'll smite Heaven's golden pride,
And never pity thee,
Immaculate divine.
None dare to stand in your way.
Thou bow to none,
Of Eden's feculence.
Conjure the serpent messenger,
Saviour order in world's decay.
Concord in temptation,
And in the fall of Eve.
For thine is the kingdom,
And the power.
For thine is the kingdom,
And the glory,
Forever.
Scholar of the unlight,
Great volcano of excrement,
Rippling eager to erupt,
Reconstellate the firmament.
Behold the great accuser,
A megalinga of throbbing zeal,
Raptor yearning to pierce,
To rape the seventh seal.
Destroyer of cosmos,
Implore the ungod,
Implode the sun,
There is none wronging the serpent's cult.
Untouched and ignored,
With the serpent's might,
And the trumpets blow,
In the shadow of the horns.
For thine is the kingdom,
And the power.
For thine is the kingdom,
And the glory,
Forever.
Lightning that stabs the heavens,
Thou quiver the mount Sinai,
Split rocks on tablets of covenant
Listen for the tempest's rasp.
The black sun never sets,
For it never rose.
The Caesar's wrath.
Empire's fall,
Petition the lord with fire,
Erect from pole to pole,
Hear the universe scream,
Bleeding from black holes,
Whom horns caress,
And whom God mourns.
Hail Mary, full of disgrace
The Lord has fornicated with thee
Cursed art thou among men
And possessed
Cunning as shroud of Turin
On the autopsy of god
Credo undone
Bitch of a sybilline vulva
Usurpress and liar
Witch of broken vows
Centuries wept because of thee
Where art thou now in the hour of trial
Cunning as shroud of Turin
On the autopsy of god
Credo undone
Wretched is the fruit of thy womb, Babylon!
Holy mother, mother of god
Pray for us not, the sinners
Now and at the hour of our death
Amen
I descended from the Mount Sinai
Unleashed the splendour upon a scroundel mob
To shelter where no messianic light
Drove one single ray into the pulp of life
O sweet Salome I beckon thee
Bring forth thy heinous offering
Without your love
So incomplete
Corrupt me with your dignity
I decompose in rapture of hells
Dissolve divide disintegrate
I am yours
In euphoria below
At faintest whim they would impale the sun
And thus the sheep in me became the wolf in man
I am the fly that flew forth from the ark
My thoughts like insects
Whoring wounds divine
Been bored with cosmos my dear old foe
This universe has never been enough
Compelled to liberate the spring of life
When the levee breaks gush forth of stream of ice
I decompose in rapture of hells
Dissolve divide disintegrate
I am yours
In euphoria below
I cast my halo from perdition’s clay
Behold my bliss profane
Born of a lie
Condemned to lurk
Live in denial
Yet coiled aflame
I am the great rebellion
Neath Milton’s tomb I dwell
An existence even sin would not pardon
No guilt, no reason, saviour, or shame
Thee I cast aside
Fetus divine
Free of thy lies
Hearken hosts on high
Fetch me your god
As my ambition prescribes
Challenge the sun
Ascend shall I unto the heavens
Exalt my throne above his celestial display
Sit shall I upon that mount of congregation
Far toward the north
Hearken dogs of Nazarene
Linger at St. Peter’s door
Partake from the well of nothingness
Bite the withered hand of god
Ascend shall I unto the heavens
Exalt my throne above his celestial display
Sit shall I upon that mount of congregation
Far toward the north
Boreal hell beneath my feet
Blistering Eden above
With prayer on lips
With freedom bequeathed
Thru fire we walk
With fire in hearts!
Every seme the Devil breathes
My steps never outweighed the gravity of hell
So I keep praying for rain of flaming rocks
To foster the symmetry of worlds
I had a vision of the impenetrable darkness
Never found on neither side of the moon
It wields composure of my soul
That comes as one with the odium below
Chant the psalm
Retrieve the pride
Within and without
I reject each order, each idea.
I trust no abstraction, no doctrine.
I believe not in god nor mind
enough with these gods.
Give me a human.
Let him be just like me, just like me…
Dull, unripe, unfinished, dark, and not bright.
So that I may dance with him, play with him, fight with him
pretend in front of him,
tempt him and rape him
love him, recreate myself through him,
grow with him, and sprouting this way,
wed myself, in the church of man
I imagined the most ardent ray of sun
Like vulture hovering above my neck
It burns with fever deep within my soul
Erect in glory to sink into shame
Oh lord, whence came this doubt?
Thou doth know I am all and everything
Let loose my shackles
Let chaos reign
Infecting moral arteries
Chant the psalm
Retrieve the pride
Within and without
Shine through me
Come forth in war
Come forth in peace
Bring down the sun
Extinguish all the stars
Let me remain
In splendor of thy light
Bornless One
As darkness bright
Found not in tongues
Found not in light
Bring down the rain
Drain waters of Styx
Faustian luminary
Redeem
Blaspheme
Like a day without the dawn
Like a ray void of the sun
Like a storm that brings no calm
I'm most complete yet so undone
Of plague and fever
Thy name is nowhere
Thy name is never
Liberate me
Ignite the seeds
Bind not to guilt
O Father
O Satan
O Sun
Let the children come to thee
Behold the morning star
Shine through me
Come forth in war
Come forth in peace
Like a day without the dawn
Like a ray void of the sun
Like a storm that brings no calm
I'm most complete yet so undone
O Lion-Serpent Sun, The beast that whirlest forth,
a thunder-bolt, begetter of life!
Hear me, and make all spirits subjects unto me;
so that every spirit of the firmament and of the ether,
upon the earth and under the earth,
on dry land and in the water
of whirling air, and of rushing fire,
and every spell and scourge of god
may be obedient unto me.
Thou spiritual sun! Satan, thou eye, thou lust!
Cry aloud! Cry aloud!
Whirl the wheel, O my Father, O Satan, O Sun!
From the dark ancient temples
Horrible palaces
From the land of dark forests
Kingdom of snow and frost
Where true evil dwells
Where flames are spiritual food
Where black satanic holocaust strikes
And people are baptized in blood
I come with the northern winds
I remain true, closed in icy heart
Cold, I'm standing in the moonlight
Demons return to me every night
Fill my soul with sacred power
Mystical whispers resound with hallow echo
Spread out my hands
Cold north majesty rises
Unsilent winds strike this pagan landscape
Where gods sit high on the oaken thrones
I'm the dark warrior, presented in flames
Carried on the hellish wings of fire
I discover the deepest desires, feel delight
I destroy all the god's laws
I am almighty immortal power
From the blood of the earth
From its sacred soil
That alters a spell
Contorting with the stars of revenge
Come forth, martyrs of the underworld!
Blessed, but thou are not!
Cruel godhead, thy child, and in the world for so long
Its expression I draw out and march towards the sun
Unleashing force
Can't stop me now!
Born of the seas
The setting tides confine reality
Between future ov the living, perdition I dwell
Anointed by blissful hypocria that never ends!
In unyielding expression of selflessness
Where I dare to challenge thy gravity
Thus, speaks the nature of my ways
Thus, the true light illuminates!
Here lie limitless sins of eminence
Where valiant boats implode, drifts the world netherwards
Standing with face of hell, lest we flog what's crucified
I shall layeth with my soul to rest, until I reach the sun's might!
I shall not forgive!
I shall not forgive!
Living God!
I shall not forgive!
Jesus Christ!
I forgive thee not!
I shall not forgive!
I shall not forgive!
Living God!
I shall not forgive!
Jesus Christ! 
I forgive thee not!
I shall not forgive!
O how thou shine in the realm above
As planets rumble when thou descended upon this globe
To walk this Earth like a shimmering god
Let it be forever heard
We lost our Eden to own the world
Let it be forever know
We lost our battle to win the war
Come all ye, Wolves of Siberia
We hail the flame, we hail the ice
Beyond bosom, beyond materia
We reject! We fucking deny!
Let it be forever heard
From Slave to king, from king to man
Let it be eternally know
We fled from heavens to rape the world
There's serpent coiling around my neck
The adoring crescent moon in blazing night
The holy river Ganga flowing through my muddled hair
In the ancient times before I learned of who I am
If I am a missing link between the pig and the divine
I shall cast the pearls before the swine
I am no good shepherd on an ox
But a solitude ov the loneliest star
Like a 1000 shrines subsumed into the void
Like a dead space in between the suns
Is a God to live in a dog? No!
But the highest are of us
Is a God to live in a dog? No!
But the highest are of us
I shall not forgive!
I shall not forgive!
Living God
I shall not the forgive!
Jesus Christ
I forgive thee not!
Thus sermonized the serpent of Eden
Thus struck the breath of the Earth
And thus flooded the blood of the soil
Slither into the gaping void!
I worship Thee, O vicious man!
Now mark my words ye mortal race
Feed my wrath with lion's gore
Feed my envy with the fat of lambs
As the wicked ways will flourish
Behold the monuments of God decay
I stamp to dust
I despoil the holy books
I desecrate the angelic verses
Like dead leaves wither they to ash
As I am leading the hosts of stars
Onwards, embrace the Sur
I have watched the birth of planets
I have witnessed the death of worlds
I've conducted the choir of stars
I have ridden the tail of the comet
As I've transformed
From God to ash
From dust to Man
O Purple flame!
O whirling wheel of life!
Appear! Move! Rise!
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the laws divine I quell
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the raging blood cells
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the spear, the sword, the spell
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the word that openeth Hell!
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the power of the panther's spell
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the circling citadel
Come unto me Bartzabel
By this mind of miracles
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the moon and stars, I swear!
Crawl with insects and feed on barren soil!
rise above the animal in you!
Find kindness among the unkind!
Slowness of decrepitude
Like sirens beckoning me to their ruined shores!
Impotent in the eye of the storm!
Cthonic ore forefathers!
Ravishing sires of the black hosts!
Feast on their bones!
Feed on their flesh!
Prometheus' Rebirth!
In constellations with dust!
And thus thou empowered me!
I am legion in company of seraphs!
At the threshold of this godless anarchy!
Malediction to all that is Angelic!
Pariah of collapsing truth!
Crucifixion was not enough!
The alpha of this mortal whorl!
Feed on their bones!
Feed on their flesh!
Begone!
Ye prophets of Eucharist
My praise shall climb to your decline
May rust corrode on Michael's sword
Recession of the progeny divine
Come forth ye!
Preachers of imminent death
Let loose the mighty beasts upon
Bring an end to this decrepit world
Countless my legions
Many my names
A thousand descendants
A goat of Mendez
Come forth ye!
Heralds of ruir
And mute to dust their anaemic way's
Futile relic of an utopian age
King of kings recrucified
What an ignominious end!
Countless my legions
Many my names
A thousand young
A goat of Mendez
For I am my Christ over myself
The accused became the accuser
For I am Satan incarnate
Serpent of old immaculate!
I am she who spits out the lusts
The root of sin derived from me
I am born of sacrilegious uterus
Magna peccatrix
I am she who cast the adversaries out
I am the spawn of her vulva obsolete
With the sound of trumpets!
With the pounding of demon drums!
Come forth within!
Come forth without!
With the roaring thunders
With the blinding light
Come to be exalted!
Come to be despised!
For I am Aurora's son
With no beginnin, with no decline
A progency of her lecherous cunt
Love me orgasmically
Fuck me estatically
I pledge my heart to thee
I bow down devotedly
With the sound of trumpets!
With the pounding of demon drums!
Come forth within!
Come forth without!
With the roaring thunders
With the blinding light
Come to be honoured
And to be despised!
Blessed be the destroyer
For she's the creator!
Our father, who art in hell
Unhallowed be Thy name
Thy legions come
Thy enemies begone
On Earth as it is in the Netherworld
Embrace our souls untraveled
Let us sail to the farthest sea
Ignite our craving hearts
Illuminate our ageless will
Dissolve!
Coagulate!
Our father, who lies in wait
Unhallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom enshrines
Thy phosphor blinds
On Earth as it is in Hell
Embrace my soul untraveled
Let me sail to the farthest sea
When I am Thou, O Lord
And Lord when Thou art Me
Dissolve!
Coagulate!
By thou holy name: Satan
At his command
Heaven shall burn!
By thou holy name: Lucifer
At his command
Heaven shall blaze!
By thou holy name: Leviathan
At his command
Heaven shall burn!
By thou holy name: Belial
At his command
Heaven shall burn!
Morning Star
How Thou shinest in the fiery
Empyrean above
How do I rejoice, for Thy apostles flock around
For Thou art Christ a rebours!
Limbo is stirring up Thy cells
Let the cold moon
lick the blood from my stigmatas
Let the burning sun
devour gore from my wounds
Limbo is stirring up in my cells
Deep down below my odium dwells
I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore.
Oh sun and moon beheld!
When we rose up from dust
No sound or song would dare dispraise
The might we have become
We hail to Thee, O avenging force!
We are the dawn of New Jerusalem
We are the ending of all days
We are the next 1000 years!
To Christ, falls saviour on the cross!
To the Emperor of Rome!
To Christ, falls saviour on the cross!
To the devil in our souls!
We go where no mortals dare to go
Explore that human flesh yet not explored
The tree of god shall not withstand the ruthless storm
We are the death that rides the pale horse
We hail to Thee, O avenging force!
We are the deportees from the Promised Land
Fallen, but we rewrite the history with blood
We are the next 1000 years!
To Christ, falls saviour on the cross!
To the Emperor of Rome!
To Christ, falls saviour on the cross
For devil our souls!
mystic voices lead me to suicide
I will unite my flesh with him tonight
blasphemous son in my veins
into the magic circle
lord of dark winds
obscure my soul
burn my eyes
make me see illusions
burning in black flames forever
the child of my morbid perversion
is screaming glory of darkness
sing the occultic psalm
with the book of eternal oath
I created the face of the goat
unholy psalm to lead the souls
blood means the pact with my lord
cold winds of doom prevail
7 horns sing the prophecy
glory to the darkest depth
revelate my eternal prayer
primeval god finally returns
comes a sound of triumph
I hear his voice
a dawn of evil prayer
a raise of million hands
revelation of our dreams
I open my eyes
I'm into the tomb
feel a touch of cool
carry beneath the gates
and now lucifer comes
rides on the wings of winds
opens the gates of ancient towns
leads us to eternal delight
among the thousand flames
from dark to black again
his eyes are dark and cold
like northern frost
and icy breath
is a wind for the faithful
bring me there
where daylight never exists
and people live on gloom
bring me there
where I will be free
from god's tyranny
my black face in the shadow
of the pentagram
among the silent forests
in the never existing town
my fingers touched the sky
I was god in forgotten times
jesus and his servants were
sucking my feet
lucifer, give me the power to rise
now I'm fallen
a down of misery
among the blurs of evil
hidden in morality
I had power to destroy god
my demons ruled the crowd
now I can do nothing
alone in black crypt
satan, give me the power to rise
but there will be days
when I shall rise
a dawn of my kingdom
slowly comes
I will fight again
will take your mind
to sit on the golden throne
somewhere in the sky
belial, give me the power to rise
satan, give me the power to rise
Pure paganism I worship in the woods
Forest's mountains never saw by human eye
Kingdom of the ancient and horned evil
Covered by golden wood and black thorns
My armor like a bark of old oak
I rape my wounds and blood flows down to the ground
Covered by the snow naked crowns of trees
Like crying mothers Slavonic worshippers
Pagan warriors hide in frozen wood
Like black statues born in the heart of winterevil
Ride on the thunders and moonstorms
Where the land is open for full witching moon
Mouth kiss the leaves fallen in the past
Fingers touch the frozen land
Pagan fears fall down on icy skin
Wild eyes filled with dark-red blood
Are staring into depths of virgin forest
Where my grave on unholy land
Covered by the snow
Winds carry me through Transylvania
Virgin evil hidden in the blackest heart
I joined the ceremony of wolves
Where unsilent gods sit high on their goathrones
Now the majesty is ready for pure holocaust
The feast of Babylon whore and her wolf
From the dark ancient temples
Horrible palaces
From the land of dark forests
Kingdom of snow and frost
Where true evil dwells
Where flames are spiritual food
Where black satanic holocaust strikes
And people are baptized in blood
I come with the northern winds
I remain true, closed in icy heart
Fire!
Cold, I'm standing in the moonlight
Demons return to me every night
Fill my soul with sacred power
Mystical whispers resound with hallow echo
Spread out my hands
Cold, north majesty rises
Unsilent winds strike this pagan landscape
Where gods sit high on the oaken thrones
Fire!
I'm the dark warrior, presented in flames
Carried on the hellish wings of fire
I discover the deepest desires, feel delight
I destroy all the god's laws
I am almighty, immortal power
In the night of full moon sacrifice
We are joining with the sign of drums of war
Freezing moon opens the gates of paradise
Our swords are raised up to the skies
Pure evil and hate!
Sodomy and pain!
Where the holy angel's dwell we'll burn it down
We'll turn on hate god's flower of love
Brain of lust we'll spread everywhere
Our pagan brothers will sodomize Christ's flesh
Pure evil and hate!
Sodomy and pain!
they came from the cold north
carried on the wings of waves
no one knows the cult
bloody acts were only a legend
eternal hate and horned sodomy
came to the lands of virgin's goodness
moonless night showed me their return
I saw drakkars between the silence, in the dream
when the witches called the spirits from forest
from hornedlands to lindisfarne
lords of the fjord, turned daylight
into december frost, fathers of ice
proclaimed the new century, marked the paths
which I follow now, enter the forest
like you open your veins
in the night of the pagan union
witches among the night, lead me to the horned moon
I entered my evil soul to fortify my frosty hate
freezing breath of the blackheart fill the interior
pagan wings rise me over the evil palace
massacre will be the beginning of iron holocaust
evil enters the skies for the return of sodomy
black snow covers the horde of christ
winterwinds destroy jehova's palace
ancient spirits proclaimed the return
coldnights await like hungry wolves
the powers join among the mountains
the oaks sing funeral songs of frost
I drink the blood for all pagan souls
enslaved in a cloud above the vast sea
I've finished my journey through the 7 incarnations
the blaze of my glory die out for this world
as the blaze of my rustly steel died
dark forests, unknown vast lands
were my home, my dream which came true
wild as eternal fear of the blackness
I live primeval life under the horned one's rules
steeps resounded with the howl of the wolves
searching alone for the victim
and from the deep forest rised you chant
about the god of coldwinds and desire
crushing the last wound of the crucified one
I stalked the path of the sword, fire and blood
my armies of the ships like dragons
spread fear among the holy lands
altars were burning with black fire
for the master of eternal spaces
born for our blood and fiery steel
victorious wave of warfare and mayhem
immortal, invincible, dark warrior
I leaded my troops through countless battles
and the scream of the dying was our pride
I split a lot of blood, stole human souls, cruel
now it's time to finish my journey, to rest
I fall into oblivion with weapons
no one will feed my razor with blood again
and the ships sing the psalm of the immortal
mystic voices lead me to suicide
I will unite my flesh with him tonight
blasphemous son in my veins
into the magic circle
lord of dark winds
obscure my soul
burn my eyes
make me see illusions
burning in black flames forever
the child of my morbid perversion
is screaming glory of darkness
sing the occultic psalm
with the book of eternal oath
I created the face of the goat
unholy psalm to lead the souls
blood means the pact with my lord
cold winds of doom prevail
7 horns sing the prophecy
glory to the darkest depth
revelate my eternal prayer
oh, cursed profanated thougths of glory return to me
receive my every fall, my every pain and misfortune
and wrath will born inside you
stronger than sounds of bells
primeval instincts will wake
pagan brothers of our blood
professing to the majesty of horned evil
the war we'll begin
will be the final fall of god's flock
we'll have a bloodbath and covered with gore
we'll praise the name of the highest
what's you fallen god for us
he had leaded people to eternal slavery
his angels falling into night like dead swans
to rise never again
pagan around the wooden symbols
transmitting the power from hands to hands
blood for god of gods, king of kings
unholy master
flames reflects in my eyes
the wildness and hate are born
I draw the magic signs in the air
the pride, act of holy bastards burnt
here's no more place for them
there's no day, only the moon and the night
I turn into ashes all the holyness
I destroy the altars of contempt with my sword
then I hide in a blackrain, naked trees
the depths of the forests are my home
as the wolf I appear this night
as the wild dog I'm howling with lust for blood and hunger
I'm the warrior of the night obsessed by hell
bringing hate, pain and desire
I observe the blackwitches of beauty
protected with the shadow of my sword
they gave me the wisdom, fed with blasphemy
they assist in my every journey, my heart belongs to them
at midnight I call the winds of mayhem
the power of the horned evil protects me
I see how jesus tears mix with angel's blood
in my visions I observe
how the skies turn to black, with the upcoming fire
I'm playing with the view of this night
I love the gloomy landscapes of my world
obsessed like an animal, old as the planet
I speak words of the ancient knowledge
I give you things, which in paradise
could be only a dream
observe the message from the darkside of the moon
spectral warrior all in icy steel
as I proudly touch my cold weapon
the pagan steel sighs with the fullmoon
so the war has just began
enslaved nations of the tombworld
can finally reach their weapons
evil arrives in glory, comes on the four winds
and the masters of hellthrones
ride the darkness on devilwings
forces of the earth unleash the storms
final day is here my children
lambs of christ, my believers
we must destroy the reign of evil
and the holy armies of heaven rode the sky
all the angels saw the abyssic fire
and some of them threw the swords in fear
and fell down into the pit
our mayhemic, bloody steel
with the thunders of the drums
will crush the weak holyness
the forces gathered down the haar-meggido
spilt with hate all the angels blood
in black chaos hell reigns
so we won together with the evil winds
streams of blood flow through the land
open for the sons of satan
Demonic laughter your cremation
Your lungs gasp for air but are filled with blood
A sudden crack as I crushed your skull
The remind of your life flashes by
A life that soon won't be
Smiling with axe in my hand
Evil's rotten hand you'll see
I come forward
Deathcrush
I'll send you to your maker
I'll send you to your death
Death nicely crucified
Death, heads on stakes
The barbeque has just begun
Deathcrush
Deathcrush
Crush
Deathcrush
Deathcrush
In the forest of the Eternal dreaming
Old oak lighted up by the fullmoon's light
The coldness of dungeon torches the inside of wooden maze
From the womb of the mother-wolf I was born
The witches foretold the coming of tragedy
They awakened fright in the hearts of my enemies
In the midnight wilderness I took a pledge
Quickly I fell in love with the taste of steel
For ages waiting for its donudation
The final triumph
The pure barbarity
I howl to the moon to support my battle
The moon, symbol of purity, the essence of beauty
I damn the sun, rising again and again
In brightness of bloody light, steel holocaust
I received hails from the northern side
Of snowcovered Carpathians
The light breath of nightbreeze, as a sign
I summon the iron powers, cavalry of my brothers
From the land of armageddish fields
I am bard of the eastern lands
I lead my brothers for death struggle
In glory of victory my armies rise
Barbarians tribes with fury of desecration
With axes reach the sky, hiding usurpator in their wings
Call the clouds, desecrating all the holiness
Hurt bodies on the snow, Pandaemonium burns
This battle is a rebellion, rebirth of old traditions
Mythical hell is the paradise to the true warriors
There they attain eternity and sit high on the thrones
Pagan nations became united
Mighty bards received their long awaited silence
Slavs returned to their villages and woods
Pagan frights of heavenly hell dispelled
I opened the door to the higher than stars knowledge
And took a long walk through the unknown dimensions
As the sign of the fullmoon, in damnations I shall rise
From the land which hasn't enter yet
Into the history
From the depths of swamps we are bringing
Proudly our name
At night, kissing the moonlight
rebel children living in twilight
Like wolves
some named us so
Union with people from the sign
Of the half-moon
To crush the golden walls of
Earthly heaven,
To strangle the pestilence
To the lands of the mighty Empire
Others even think about with fear
We invaded a state with sword
In our hands
Roma means nothing
In the land of Slavs!
Today forests sing about the legend,
Long forgotten spirits
Whose names nobody remembers now
Waiting their day to reborn
Their visions of the past
Are torturing our souls
Whispering in the dark
they will come here again
To reign supreme
Believe my words
From unremembrance
From Fire and Water
From the sacred woods
Ancient Wolves gather
From the burnt Arkona
From the Pagan Vastlands!
Black horse rides across the sky
With a sword we will open the amber gates of Nawia
Night in the mountains comes with the fly of a raven
Carpathians bathed in the light of the moon
In old ruins where the dying shadows
Are watching the shine from the stars
Nobody remembers days of glory
Several hundreds years passed in silence
Not a soul has been seen here
I am standing on a hill
So silent is the sky
I am drinking in the cold of this night
Old grey wolf lying upon my foots
Is licking the hand of mine
It is night in my heart
It is moon in my eyes
I am hidden in a fog of my own breath
Small village in a valley
Sleeping in a fear, in a fear of me!
Loathsome race of the mortals
Magic of wolfish teeth, wings of bats
Faithful guards of religion
Old as the blood itself
The Cult of the Undead Vampirism!
Frenzy of lust, frenzy of pain
She was only fourteen
No cry has bursted from her lips
Pity that she had to die
But how sweet was her neck
It is night in my heart
It is moon in my eyes
I am hidden in a fog of my own breath
Sometimes only my anthem of triumph
Echoes in mountainous landscape
Like blood from torn open arteries
Poison flows down the tongue
Somewhere far away a howling can be heard
Oh, how beautiful is the night of Transylvania
Frenzy of lust, frenzy of pain
Blood is life
ETERNAL
With a little fear I kiss the moonlight
How exciting is the thought
About having a taste of your kingdom
Which wakes up to life, at night
When the servants carry me to the gates of Helevorn
Dreams about unlimited dimensions
Float over Thy Golden Palace
Snowcovered majesty, damned
In nocturnal solitude I pace, deeper into virgin forest
Among sadness and depressive thoughts
Visit firmaments of dead nature
In the glare of black mirror, asleep
Forgotten temples of gods of forests
Welcoming the son of godly Teuton, father of fathers
The source of the deepest darkness and magic
The mightiest emperor, cammrad of war
With blessings I join the caravan of my brothers
Like a thunder I strike into the Jehova's armies
I dance with holocauststorms in this battle
I set the holy fire of aurora borealis
This fire, this flame, this redness, live forever
Since a long time I've visited those old dungeons
I spilled the first blood in the depth
In the darkness of the forest's maze
I found her, morbid beauty
I used to spend whole days
In the mystic places of Delduwath
There, where the light of the halfmoon
Fell as the dying sun
The wolf's howling was lulling to sleep
My young soul
How beautiful were the views of nocturnal land
How wonderful was the life in complete solitude
Away from villages and towns, mansions and palaces
The last moments give birth to memories in me
Who was that beauty, majestic and great
What were those views, beautifully gilded by leaves
Which were hiding behind them so many mystic wefts
They stole my solitude and independence
I lie crushed by the chains in a wet cell, bleeding
I am awaiting for mother, the last hope, death
Let the died out fire away in me, let it awake Aldaron
Black gusts of dust covered my divine person with their arms
The gates of nature for ages dead, opened themselves
Tears of soil filled the green valleys
Naked Carpathian mountains denudated its might
Rights which created this world
With fury strike heaven, pearly gates
The dark powers of nature unleashed veritable war
The last breaths of sun falling onto the snow
Turned into the scream of the dying light
Delightful night
When the fullmoon lights cemetery's valley
Winds of frost strike my tomb
When I am in eternal sleep
When wild storms dwell
Wind blows through the Baltic
Instincts unleash the war inside
And strike the sky with holocausthunder
Mountains sleep, the forest
Covers freezing land where I was born
Now I walk among the castles
Watch the streams of frozen tears
Spilled with blood of forefathers
Nightbreeze feed my spiritual form
And spirits gather, floating in the mist
My eastern empires spread wings of winter
Visions of destructions ruin and tragedies
Tasting pure sin, fade into the pit
And walk through my beloved, endless woods
I summon all the beauty Evil
To rape the bodies of your disciples
Too long I hide in shades of woods
And now I build my beauty Hall
Wallachian tyrant, I bring a winter
I come with frost and burning hate
Follow the Gods of Eastern Lands
Being the battle which blows the earth
There was only one long and terrible winter
Where icy blackness covered the sun and the grass
Dethroned light ended its existence
Hell brought there all thunders and winds
All the blasphemy from the four sides of the world
Gods have forgotten this land, where fear
Caught the throat with the bony hand
And the wolf howled gloomy song of cold, frost and hunger
The lakes enslaved in hard icy shackles
Wild trees covered the happy world
Which will never wake up again
Life has affected a new form here
Through the icy vastlands run wild
Hordes of wolves, moonless night, that's all
Moon is covered with fresh meat, threw by the hungry hordes
Darkness spread its dark wings
Whispers of woods were growing
With every moment
I felt them paying enormous tributes
Powers, which were still alive at night
In the battle of light with dark earth
Spirits of their own nature fight proudly
Live by my side, feed young heart of mine
But I cannot ever see them
I don't know her powers, but I know it's great !
Loves, gives birth, kills
it's powerful
She raises beautiful monuments by the Baltic
Lives when I sleep and lives in me
At night raises over dreaming forests
She awakes Gods and Goddesses, unsilently
The night cock she is, whispers wolfish spells
The chants of bard she knows and hums them
Goblins of oaks and denizes of darkness
Bathed in the wine of a delightfull night
And lives there, but dies at dawn
Dies in me with barbarous voice.
The dark forest enchant me
I've met in surrounding me nature
spirits and deities wielding the element,
in a field, in a forest, in rocks and caves
and I won their goodwill with sacrifices.
Horses carried me to the skies,
White, beautiful steeds beloved.
I was attacking brushwood violently
I touched motherland
Magic cirkles and black stones
Forest spells and damned souls
I find worship in you
They will return, dance like fire, as before
They will return, to the trees,
to the forest of mine, to the kingdom !
The thunderer demons
guards the sacred spot
during those cold nights
they found peace and consolation.
I rediscover the power and charm
to defeat like a sorcerer,
like thousands years ago,
Oaken castles from millenium before,
They will rise once again as a sign
Where the magic stream flows,
Through the shining woods,
Blue grass of wisdom grows
Around the oaken roots
Where golden dragons fly
And the sorcerers gather,
Four wooden statues stand
And the fog lays thick
Dreamthrone of amber cosmic source of might,
Reflection of wisdom, Power of the darkside
Ceremonial steel drinks the blood,
Painting pearls and gold
Mystic flames burn bright
Around the oaken lord
Forgotten sorcery storms from the skies,
From the golden hall of the ancient ones
The Pagan awaits for the equinox
Cosmic sorcery - the gift of the skies
Magic nature - stronger than your lies
Stone demigod shines proud
The cult of the barbaric seasons,
Pagan pride forever,
Born todie in honour, not to serve on knees
Snowcovered, wild vastlands
My beloved fatherland
I see the tears of the oaken one,
My heart is like a stone,
My sword became sharp
Crosses to break, bodies to dismember,
Flowers to burn
Fallen into oblivion
The last view inside my mind
Silver walls ofg the castle
Risen proudly towards the sky
The rebellion failed
Many brave ones went down
Hung on black trees they are
Blown by the four winds
I've been waiting for years,
Growing stronger
Blazing weapons,eyes burn bright
In the dark - as a King I shall return
Horns sing in the woods,
Hordes gather
Ancient gods of war
Ride on the sky
Old kingdom will fall
Like a moondust
Reflecting down the walleys
So pure, hungry for blood
The hearts of the dark ones
Thunders strike
Dancing on the black mirrors
The bards of war and venegeance
Came from forgotten realms
As a King I shell return
To proclaim my victory,
Return of ancient pride,
Laws of steel
Cold steel
I break the chains of unbelief
Burden of millenial slavory
Forest, eternat wander
Extending beyond earthly dimensions
Gods will return to their graces together with me
They'll find their oaken kingdoms as before
I free my powers when yelling silently
When I fight 
thousands of demons, follow me
And my strength, and my spell
And my beautiful pride,
Will find and wrap you will raise majesty to the skies
From the depths of the earth, deep and black
Through the forests, woods and shadows,
It Will penetrate lakes and wolfish mountains
On the wings of demons to skies
I denude golden gates of my Nawia
Shrouded in thick smoke of burnt bodies
I show my love I praise the might
And destroy with the power of thunders
constantly destroy
On my right hand 
fire, eternaly devoted
Together with the strength of thunders
Will dance as before
The conflagration, death and misfortune, let it beget
Rebuild what was ruined,
Destroy what was created by the cross
And my strength, and my spell
One eyed old man I am
Yet I possess the knowledge of thousand sages
An unborn child I am
Though I have existed for billion years
The invisible army I am
Though the won battle still to come
The father of ambitious and disappointed I am
Brother in sin and abasement
I was Judas in your dream
Who worshipped money above all
I was the roman warrior
Who wounded you and drank the divine blood
I was pilate on your trial
Who spat in your pale face
Each thorn was a sinful spell
Each nail the fulfillment of the revenge
For which I have been waiting for so many years
Hatred for thousand holy heads
And also that many daggers pointed at their visages
The fallen angels, mythical daemons
Triumphant in their blasphemy
I am Gordon, my name is annihilation
Extermination
I am the thousand plagues and afflictions
For ages travelled by the holy fire
Today free, free and triumphant
To no avail for the dungeons and chains of the inquisition
Poor and lonely are my adversers
Who serving the beast for million years
With the whip and crown of thorns
Shall be remunerated today
Wanderer, perpetual and restless
Master, equally hideous & beautiful
Loved and adored 
How simple it is
For many years my semen hath envenomed the races
Abomination to the earthly, to everything that is simple
And obscure at the same time
Therefore let us celebrate the antithesis of the eucharist
With the sacerdoral gesture you welcome us
I am your dazing threshold
Let us commence! We are void of our bodies
The night, that we are honoured to celebrate
Perhaps the last during which I satisfy my desire
Wanderer, perpetual and restless
Master, equally hideous & beautiful
The real world or the imaginary vision
Still perceptible to my chaotic thoughts
Nothing shall taste the same again
I am waiting for you to stab the world in its heart
Father!
Art thou blind and deaf?
Old man!
Decrepit and hideous
Hidden in woods of madness and anxiety
I am the beast, thou the refugium of love
Whereas your love as a cockroach
Under my own boot
I am the Gehenna of humanity, whereas thou art me mercy
And what shalt thou need it for
If the world shall fall asleep under my wings anyway
I am the blood from thy limbs, thou art the wisdom
Is it a great one, yes, vain fools do believe in it
They still go up in flames in anyway
Devils tongue is the tongue of fire
Yes, the same that burneth thine houses
Consumeth light and thy sheep damned!
And even their wool is shaddy, and the meat poisonous
Not for the hungry dogs at my table
I shall destroy everything, or not
I shalt throw it to vultures to devour, let them feast!
Devils tongue is the tongue of the night
Whenever thou delight in this beauty
Thou pour in thyself the wine of the underworld
And whenever thou crave for bearing it
There are only the whispers of trees thou can hear
Hungry of thy love, I am anticipating my time
Devils tongue is the tongue of my father
The one, who with universe constituteth an entity
Father who shall not sell thou out for any flirt
Forlove - affairs, kisses of humanity
Therefore give me his darkness
Power, might, hope and fulfillment
Give me his light
It is the time for the feast of hell
Sister of sin
Lover of my unwedden night
In blasphemy we bathe our unclean bodies
We find adoration in the filthy procreation
His will is our devotion
Giving in to the knight of the remote star
Falling in love with the darkest tormentor
The basic instinct, the obscurity of my soul
We hide our secrets damnedly deep
And these are the key to the sempimental glory
To the harmony of body and soul
Immortality, spiritual ecstasy and diableria
Sister of sin
When rich and when poor
On my way to the throne
Lay bare on your gems
The nest of filth and licentiousness
Of am I drinking your sweetest juices
The poison in the wine of asceticism
Down am I sitting om the fathers right side
And with his benediction
I am opening the Pandora's box.
Sometimes when I visit the landscapes of the shadows
Something that recalls the grave
Hides in the hellish depths and awaits
When I dream, it peeks into empty goblet
and becomes the wine of ecstasy and licentiousness
I know the one in a flock said 
Watch out, watch out
But I will not go away till I taste the sweetness of your body
No matter it poisons and causes death
The past is like an eternal funeral
Years, thousands of them, I rotted in a monastic cell
I resembled a stone, hiding my murderous self in silence and fear
I lasted in the infinity of meditations and contamplations
Waiting for the deserved dream, there on the holy land
And its taste and coldness I remember
Bare-foot digging my own pit
I was kissing it as if the sweetest lover and begged
But was the sand to become my salvation
Or worms the people on the court of light
The past reeks of an oak coffin, so wet and old
Burning dirty claws in the wooden eyes of Jehovah
I killed mercy, spotting on the laws of god
I celebrated the birth of power
I fall in love with freedom and the beast
And I spat out the Antichrist from my morbid womb
In order to give life to alvine grain
And concentrate the birth of human tragedy & destruction
I envisaged myself as a great magician
Although they called armageddon the whore
Today I celebrate my birth, though I am elder than the world
The past only sometimes is like the sind
That we grave-digger throws in your eyes.
Freedom, said I
And then the sun set and the dusk
Fell on my life
Transformations and metamorphoses
It was what I experienced there, on the south of heaven
I was striking with my fists at the heavens ceilings
Too low I fell, I did not reach the step-father's neck
Although his visage seemed so close
With bony fingers I desired to clench the crown of thorns
In vain, I have trampled the paradisical flower of love
And I trample its rights here, on the earth
Each sin, my soldier
A daemon of the several thousand strong cavalery
Not gods son I am, but the child of million stars
While each of them symbolises different human fraility greater than mine
I am the wisdom and the perfection of the universe.
How hard to fall asleep when I miss your majesty
How hard to live when I long for your devil's warmth
And livid skies over Wittenberg
And the empty streets and pavements of the town
Everything sinks into dead tears
And craves for charlatantry
Mephisto you are born inside me again
But will you speak my names in the ancient tongues?
Among thousands flames of profigacy
Naked bodies flowing in the stream of wild dreams
I strip myself of my sacred virtues
The picture of male domination and treat in blood
And blood and pride old and clotted already
But I can still see its drops on my bot face
And pain and candles everywhere and incense
And your dream which I wish to wake up in every day
Everything so ephemental and equally unreal
And this blood and candles burnt away; and they burn till today
Mephistopheles, thousands times I saw in sleep
The essence of the eternal life but have I found it?
If I am who I am, then I shall bombard the human race
with the spell of hell
I shall go deeper down the Dante did
And tame the snakes of mine
Phallic signs and symbols, the seed of truth
And belief in eternal life
We transgress the context of commonplacenes
We deny normality, trample morality
We destroy angels with sound
We destroy angels with silence
Currents of tantric anarchy seize our bodies
Into the cosmic dance of four scythes
The curtains of Absurd Theatre are raised
Synchronicity 
Mother Chaos on the stage
Wisdom saysm be strong!
Thrilling words are spreading down the spine
Vibrating
be strong!
Exhausted I'm running towards the last shines of consciousness
Which is absorbed by shadows of madness
Here are the star and the snake servants;
they rise the hexagram
Sun in the triangle hidden 
Sight, sacred visions entwined
And union with Nothingness body I'll find
Strength, go along the Mars path, fighting if we must;
Light, oh, you are Ahathoor, goddess of blue sky
There is might of dawn, in non-quality state I remain
Of commonness crippled time or sand
glass you don't see again
picture of myself I'm drawing
With life, venom and hell I'm sprinkling it
His name is Esial, I want him more
Children of technocracy invoke synthetic spirits
Plastic crosses choke perspiring necks
I cast dices, but curtain of future is still hermetic closed
Rise! Rise up my Soror, and you, my Father -
High! Towards the stars when the white fire
Which purifies and melts all false sacrament
Ashes' power equal thousands suns
Mysterys' structures are like chaos of known
Objectivism is subjective mandala of reality
Fractals, flaming spaces consume ego's order
Illumination in the face of thousand faces
Gnosis obtained by descending into the tunnels of self-knowing
When thunders of ecstasy strike black waves of unconscious sea
I swim, float, drift, scream
And barriers of self change in legion of escaping bats
Avatars of powers from four worlds
Bathed me in jewels of belief
I drink the nectar of Goddess, my eternal mistress
And multitude of forms surpasses myself
I kneel before Isis, I, her god and slave
Coiled serpent lifts up his head and looks in my eyes
Third power and third eye create The One
I am who I am not
I negate and confirm
I transgress
it is real!
Wheels of change turn with my breath
I touch the red-hot firmament of golden darkenings of heavens
And stars are falling down onto every side of world
With my tongue I penetrate scarlet abysses of Kteis
Overflowing my body with thrill and heart with warmth
Suddenly I'm shooting forth venom
'Cause I, I became a snake who rounds her flesh
Here and now, here and now
Madness creeps through arteries of Grand Cosmic Body
Higher and lover, towards all directions
It violates old laws, repeals all orders
And seeks infinity in holy letters
Child in crown its guide
Ever Coming Son
But it rambles suspended between emanations of Increasing and Descending
Thousand paths across thousand spheres
Mind is torn apart by Macrocosmic Snowflake
Death!
Prismatic trees grow from mad rites
The knowledge of geometry elevated to the dignity of living substance
The Fool in the Universe knows nothing as usual
Transubstantiation of excrement and Styx waters is done!
Carnal alchemy
Sephirotic transformation
In new body god incarnates
Beyond duality, beyond understanding
Castrated man, bastard, secret chief is born
He builds the bridge of agreement
spectre of his fall
And he is devoured by the fire of the Abyss
O, ye whose future is in other hands!
Foul feeders! Slipped, are ye on you excrement?
Parasites! Having the world lousy,
Imagine ye are of significance to Heaven
I, who enjoy my body
I would rather pack with wolves
than enter your pest-houses
Sensation, Nutrition, Mastication, Procreation
This is your blind-worm cycle
Know ye of nothing further than your own stench?
Heaven is indifferent to your salvation or catastrophe
Honest was Sodom!
Your theology is a slime-pit of gibberish become ethics
In your world, where ignorance and deceit constitute felicity
Everything ends miserably
besmirched with fratricidal blood.
I am thine own begotten
Divine Mars, thou call'st me son
And thou, Apollo, my begin gav'st me
That dream hath my mind inflamed
And everyone a star hath become
My brothers and sisters in cosmic ectasy
Millions of sins and virtues were they
And all, the whole wealth of my life
That neither the end nor the beginning had
I could bestow
Starspawn
Exploring our gracious flight, hiher,
We could make love to numberless stars,
With our tiny hand the world embrace
Learn it and forget it, be begotten and die
Forever exist, only mightier and absolute
Myself am Solaris
Universe and oneness
Nothingness and chaos am I
The last bow to thee, Earth, before
I ride a cosmic snake and devour the stars,
Before I become the beast
And no mortal man durst my magic defy
Planet Satan, receive the eternal possessor!
Me for myself I ascend thee
Me for the world
Welcome to Theatre of Absurd
When the world and rason are audience
And actor illusion and experience only
Here gleams shiny mandala
In the chamber of creation and annihilation
And Lingam links with Yoni wisdom stone make
There is neither space nor time
Books are read backwards or from all side
Everything Will sinks and tears down phantom of mourning
Picture of universe in this simple formula
Love is the Law
Proverb of juggler on the gate engraved
That life is delight
That death is also life
Fly, fly high my Black Eagle
Let golden thread bind our eyes
May our minds and hearts blood unite
On your wings carry me over the abyss
Beyond The Reason and across the burning seas
Then, with your claw tear the earth to the halves
And usher me into the secrets of her bowels
Down to the light of the beginning and the end which shimmers
Circle! Round and round my Black Eagle
Let our senses be touched by ultimate pleasure
May the passion of hunting become all-devouring
Slash! Slash with your beak
Remove all gods from my way, and thoughts, and sorrows
And let me trespass the barriers of fear
Scream! Let the whole cosmos tremble
May echoes become my the sweetest mantra
Spirit of Freedom! Eternal Wanderer! Joyfull Solitude!
Higher and higher towards the stars of Awareness
Let worlds of imagination and fact become one
Where I am you, and you are me
Been haunted be the paws of fear
And felt his breath upon my neck
I was granted with the pain divine
And my voice was heard no more in heaven
Great in power
Thus call'st me almighty
Un not be first archangel
I shall be the last among thee
Come over to seduce your angels
Been born to rape your mother's holy womb
Rebel
So call me now
As I stand above ye all
Leave me unworshipped
In the dens below forever I shall dwell
Malice in heart was bred and lives again
My legions hid in south Eden
My flaming passions
Oceans of love
And all thou call'st
The evil
I summon thee
Bringer of war
Bearer of light
Earth's son
Great in power
Thus call'st me almighty
In not be first archangel
I shall be the last among thee 
On fire of darkness

muting the foul angelic choirs!

none of thy weak brothers, shalt ever share my blood
my awareness, catalyst, of godhate I have spawned
in sinister ecstasy eternally I decompose

I am the most conquering One
I'm burning like a fucking fire
Mysterious Domain, Murdered Apprehension
glow like the Sun
in this final hour
ov Dawn ov the Dusk
I, heart ov all chthonic hearts
vulture eye, fallen one, proclaim:
this great world
is a mirror of my small self:
striving for infinity, shall I remain?
we cannot kill the time:
it is the time that kills us
and I'm the answer on my questions
and blood of my hopes and all prayers
mark the sunset, the last judgment
and my rainment
this is the night, just black damn'd night
as dethroned so enthroned, attracted, rejected
in this totality is perfection of Me in Thee
freedom of Nature, delight of Existence
so intoxicate me as I intoxicateth thee
slay me as I created thee
when reality is nothing more
than quantum vortex deep sleep
make it lucid dream
or hallucinate if you please
in exaltations of All, One, None
there Is No Difference
we are the First and we are the Last
Leviathan!

by the powers of the gods

gods ov all perfection
I command
come forth!
in company of Ur
all doubts and fears eclipsed
before the beginning of years
there came to the making of man
time, with a gift of tears
grief, with a glass that ran
pleasure, with pain for leaven
summer, with flowers that fell
rememberance fallen from heaven
and madness risen from hell
strength without hands to smite
love that endures for a breath
night the shadow of light
and life the shadow of death
and the high gods took in hand
fire and the falling of tears
and a measure of sliding sand
from under the feet of the years
and froth and drift of the sea
and dust of the laboring earth
and bodies of things to be
in the houses of death and of birth
and wrought with weeping and laughter
and fashioned with loathing and love
with life before and after
and death beneath and above
sounds of the night
are born from the stillness
censer scent of the sun
attracts the memories
dark shades eyes
moths
green pupils
burning echo of your words
appears
in the heart of possibility
in extra-real surroundings
there are my passions:
simplicity of stars
royal Art
and I transport
spell of self-love I weave
and I scream
in the fumes of antiquity
divine past
in solar room
filled with midnight hour
and midday power
inevitable, immovable
with names witch are Many
with secret meaning:
and I THINK, FEEL, and LOVE
we vibrate light
together
radiate life
on the path to City of the Sun
angel calls out
and I understand the Burden
ov this journey
I know, I will
I dare, and keep silence
the son of morn
what made me so divine?
I, transcending ecstasy through ecstasy
I who am eternally defined by my Will
behold I am the spawn of downcast Ariman
awakened, yet am no longer human
kindle me to Thy rapture
as I descend into Sheol
hear my call!
transform my flesh into flame
hear my cry!
sustain my being in million-fold forms
our creed: the living flesh
our law: trespass all the laws
all stirs within
this chaos in and above me
in the world of nether-nether
infinite space is all-consuming
behold! I am unending!
the conciousness of I shines universally
unbound by wretched dogma
I spew my will forth!
hell is democracy!
all things exist in me
I believe in naught save myself
my sermon steadfast and proud:
there is nothing but god in me!
all things stir in me
with joy and suffering
my sermon steadfast and proud:
there is nothing but god in me!
Father of Terror!
enter the pylon
thru' the galleys of past
catacombs of night
into the starry womb
slay, slay!
we have no fear
our time had come
our will is done
dance, dance!
O Mighty One
in the fields of Aqert
and spit
upon slaves of death
War God!
trample all weakness
this is your day of pride
draw Thy flaming sword
cut the umbilical cord
to set me free from eternal sleep
step by step
evolution
spiral vibration
can you hear?
can you touch?
can you see?
can you really see?
we charm all jins
automata, inprinted realities
they creep like snakes
and all we feel
is painful bliss
as we burn forth
like winged globe
like solar disk
and penetrate eternity
Slaves shall serve!
Slaves Shall Serve!
O Mighty Watcher!
Thou art all and all art in Thee
free me from mortals
intoxicate with Thy self love
O Mighty Sentinel!
Thou art the concious one
break the monotony of existence
that I may illuminate!
uncrowned in Tarterean Sulphur
elder than the Memphian kings
Thy reign so timeless and infinite
ever silent watchers, whom mankind yet aches to embrace
grand me Thy Promethean rays
blacker than light
cunquering lion-headed god
by the name of Legion dost Thou arrive
Thou hast seen the prophets in the desert
Thou hast bled for the fallen idols from beyond
prevailing stregth hath made Thee greater
than the god
from amongst the million dead angels army
Azazel, begotten not of human race
honour the divinity vision of victorious sun
open wide your glimmering eyes
bathe in divinity of loneliness
empowered in self creation
shine inward!
the profoundest one
spread Thy wings
the desolate one
Thy disease untamed within the sinister self
O Mighty Watcher!
Thou art all and all art in Thee
free me from mortals
intoxicate with Thy self love
O Mighty Sentinel!
Thou art the concious one
break the monotony of existence
that I may illuminate!
beyond all cowardness!
hast Thou no fear?
spit out the blasphemy!
strive unto sin
seduce Thyself
o mighty seer!
the ancient voyager
blind me with light
the sleepless ones
in aimless andering
Thou must first fall
to reign in blasphemy
Ascend as empires burn
Conquistadors of the promised land
Like the sons of Anak
They shall rise from beyond the dawn
Rise as victorious trumpets call
Chimera, Geryon and Thee oh Sphinx!
Accompanied by Mars
Jupiter's rays in fearless eyes unrestrained
Bring forth the iron rain!
Bring forth plagues on an ever failing race!
Thou shalt restore the splendor of Sodom
Personification of Gommorah art Thou
Iron-willed marching on ahead
With passion enraged threats torn asunder
Fill my veins with liquid iron
Armor chest and head with shining gold
That I may shake the fragile earth
May my will forever be unrestrained
Bring forth the iron rain!
Bring forth plagues on an ever failing race!
Great architect
Charlatan of fairy tales
Thou hast failed
Since the hour bastard spawn
Who was vomited forth
From a gasping wound of a whore
Father, forgive me not
For I have sinned
Now tremble and fear
And mercy have not upon me
Begotten son I am not
Adversary of Thy love
The outcast of Thy paradise
Despised
Nemesis!
As one we stand!
Divide and conquer!
And we shall own this fucking earth!
The all prophetic incantation
I was here before the beginning came
And I am the one to come after all myths and gods
Remain I shall beyond the end of days
I pity Thee not oh self despising slave
Thy self contempt filled with disgust
Cast aside Thy scorn ov the earth
Until I lay my wrath upon the Thee I shall
Eat the weak!
Fuck the flesh!
Slit the throat!
Consume the dead!
Drowned in empty black
Attempt to embrace my universe
I learnt how to crawl through knives and thorns
Drowned in alienation
I drag myself through the mud
Hatred injected, abhorrence accepted
When mankind fall prey
I shall arise!
And Great Dragon from my mouth emerged
And all the treasures of this world belong to me
In the sweetest inorganic embrace of my devotee
I pledge my dagger unto Thee
Blessed with the Promethean rain
Tranquility I may find in bottomless pits
I shall carry this darkness on my back
'Till the day all the suns eclipse I shall...
Eat the weak!
Fuck the flesh!
Slit the throat!
Consume the dead!
Oh, Serpent and Lion!
I invoke Thee!
Inside the shrine called life
By the seven wonders
By myriad mortals
That gone
And are to come
Outside!
Outside desert of restriction
In act of rebellion
On the sea of motion
Stability of matter
By serenity, strength and beauty
By the mighty chant of every breath
In serpentine dance of blood cells
In simplicity of spells
Divine names, meta-games
I greet Thy presence
Oh Snake! Thou art God!
Coiled underneath my throne
With Thee I reunite
With blood we make this covenant
Myself I redefine
Look in and above
There is more than the flesh
Look careful and Thou may see
The unextinguished flame
The nectar of Thy rage
I taste from the cup of fornication
And woman by my side
And scarlet is her skin
She's eager to rise
And so eager to please
Another day
Another eternity gone
And on the stairway to salvation
I walk alone among the falling stars
Looking for company
Where art Thou?
Oh, lacerate ones!
Arise! my sweetest friend
Or be forever fallen
We have finally arrived
From prison of this life
To Kali's womb
Down to the earth
As angels of almighty god-
Chaos!
'Tis our last fall
To touch our mother whore
The harlot of the saints
That spits on the rotten cross
Incinerate the icon
The symbol of all loss
To stand straight
At the left hand of god
be Thou my ally!
Join me among the bright hosts
Wondering neither way of light
Nor darkness
Of which seed
Sprouts dispassionately
In the summer of my life
From long forgotten aeons
At sunrise Thou shouldst come
Desired for so fucking long
Ascend at my command
Surmount the sea
Throw open portals of life
And scale this endless mountain
Of grace and of tears
Oh voice unspoken, mourn unheard
Abandoned heart so desolate
Rise!
Bow down before the kingless throne
When sun is yet to rise
Consume this putrid sphere!
Forever and beyond
When heavenly chants mute
Thy apparition did I behold oh Venus, the sweetest of them all
Let me bathe in Thy divinity
Descend! and Thou hast descended
Depart not yet!
I crave for warmth of blissful rays
And fateless eyes encourage me
The ancient dreaming
The wolf's unchained
Disobedience has such a victorious taste...
Rise!
Bow down before the kingless throne
When sun is yet to rise
Consume this putrid sphere!
Forever and beyond
Forever abandoned among gods
Since I have been made flesh,
And yet I challenge Thee!
Canst Thou hear my battle cry?
my friends.
There are no gods beyond those made of human flesh.
There is no more divine potential than a human potential 
and let this be the mightiest of all laws!
Behold the throne of burning gold
And all the evil that it shelters
Yet I be monarch myself
Offering more than others give
Materialize the ashes of Elysium burned
Not even angels dare to bid farewell
Annihilate this Eden now
Blasphemy gives birth to divine
Feed my flame!
Rape these wounds!
Raise me high!
Through Thy rage my will manifests
I truly am my own redeemer
Blindly I follow none but myself
Without fear I am
Unhallowed be my name
Myself am hell and hell I shall unleash
I laugh at Thee to scorn
Mock Thy majesty
Pour forth my chalice of victory
Hear my call!
Bless my path!
Lift me up!
Through Thy wrath my will manifests
Feed my flame!
Rape these wounds!
Raise me high!
Through Thy rage my will manifests
Hear my call!
Bless my path!
Lift me up!
Through Thy wrath my will manifests
What fool are ye!
From zenith to nadir
Through externalized purity
Dexterity
Sealed ye gates of your own paradise
Thou art pure in Thy sinistry
For those who cannot see
The Unconditioned One!
Thee who spits out sun
From thy mouth
In endless momentum
On road to immortality
We go against current
To the womb of Kali
Through the mouth of Bhairavi
To the final dawn of Chaos
How come we're still alive?
In these kingdoms of filth
When heaven's so abstract
And hell is so real
In my church of disbelief
It can get no better
When days turn from black to grey
In church of indifference
So innocent in their guilt
Perfect in their imperfection
Let my children play
In my church of liberation
When doubts and fears wither away
I stand alone vs. the world
In the church of man
Where god is trapped in human flesh
I never pray
In church of pain
I spoil none but myself
Yet my monologue's unheard
In my church of hope
Yearning for Thy sweet embrace
The waters of Styx I have crossed
In this church of sulphur rain
Flaming mouth of Sheol
In my church of broken word
It's so little that I ask
The brightest of the days
The darkest of the nights
What once was
I wish no longer be
Fear of separation is no more
One cosmic breath-the whole eternity
Unbroken flow of awareness conquers entropy
The voyager, bathed in venusian rays
Let them shine through me
Split the seas
Awake inner divinity
The flame of awareness comes to my eyes
Split my skin, fuck my wounds
Desecrate the Inner Sanctum in which I hide
Drag me through the mud, blind my whitening eyes
That I may see darkness in the tunnels of light
Pain I cannot deny
As I rot in this empty shell
Swamped in disaffection
Introducing to my newborn hell
Be it not so!
Thou shall see me not in agony
Failure was and is no option
'Tis my undying self
The ever wandering son ov the morn
Abandoned, yet never to be conquered
I never mourn, I never look back as long as Thy phosphoric rays
Grant me more pleasure than pain
I, who is evil can receive no good
Though I still crave, I'm yearning for
Thy healing touch of grace
Pain is timeless
When I question the laws of god
Drowned in everlasting confusion
Caress my hate against the mob
Be it not so!
Thou shall see me not in agony
Failure was and is no option
'Tis my undying self
The ever wandering son of the morn
Abandoned, yet never to be conquered
The opponent!
My life's work is complete...
Hark the howl of pestilential wind!
Atem, devourer of life forever blackening!
Sculpted in stone by the Assyrian wind
Semen of Hanpa has vomited Thee forth
Reveal to us overwhelming might
Release Thy rage destroyer of lies
Hark the howl of pestilential wind!
Atem, devourer of life forever blackening!
Unveil the primal chaos within Thyself
Daughter of Anu slain, Lamashtu annihilate!
Reveal to us overwhelming might
Release Thy rage destroyer of lies
Transcending the wrath of The Great Black
Slay the reptile!
Slay I command!
May 107 complete the cycle
When aeon of Seth emerges
The desert storms can not be tamed
When concubine of chaos begins her dance
Reveal to us overwhelming might
Release Thy rage destroyer of lies
Reptile!
Spreading sickness and disease among the men
Grubby creed!
What are ye but the soulless meat?
Lunatic!
Cancer consuming Thy race from inside
Beware!
No grace awaits Thee in the crying skies above
I'm on my way
Destination hell
By the power of will
I shall complete
The devil's work
Vultures attack!
May hell unlock overpowering might
Mourn not, my comrades!
Thou art fateless in the blinding light
Soldiers!
On the altar ov liberation crucify the whore
Rejoice!
Drink to crucifixion
For oppression is no more!
Slay the whore!
Make it bleed,
Make it weep
Let it die forever more
Slit the throat!
Let them rot
Let them pay
Let em taste their own blood
Make em crawl!
Upon this corpse
I shall feast
'Till no hope remains for the twisted mob!
Raise Thy sword of judgment, loose the iron rain
Beat the drum
No earthly power
May hinder nor stop Thee
Sekhmet!
Manifestation of Mut
Protector of Ma'at
I call upon the most divine
To spew forth this infecting dust of life
I'm on my way
Destination hell
By the power of will
I shall complete
The devil's work
I saw the virgin's cunt spawning forth the snake
I witnessed tribes of Judah reduced to ruin
I watched disciples twelve dissolved by flame
Looked down on son of god snuffed in vain
Blow your trumpets Gabriel!
As I beheld the bewilderment of Eden
Break the bread
and crumb by crumb into the Leviathan's den
Nations fall prey
Hail my return
Tribe of Judah decimate
Root of David eradicate
Let wine of Sodom fill our mouths
Hosanna Hosanna
May Sin of Gommorah grace our hearts
Ascending in sectarian rapture
We are an oracle of locust
Sanguine as yet anointed
We rave the pearly gates
Walk with me
Pilate, lead the way
I call upon Cains of this world
We are marching to the funeral of God
Illuminate
Adoration of murder,
Raise up the rusty knife
To pierce the heart of your brother
Cast your stones
Lapidate me
Cursed be the Paraclete
Pour salt into my wounds
So doth Lord speaks through thy deeds
I shall redeem my spirit
Just grace my crux with sin
If you give me the nails
I'll hammer them in
Illuminate
Exploration of darkness
I raise the rusty dagger
To pierce the eye
Thee I Invoke, bornless one
All woman, pure predator
Wherein conspiracy and impulse dwell
Like a seething fall from grace
Thou art pale hecate
Rising from thessaly
You're in my dreams
The Darkness in my heart
The rapture in their screams
Black Goddess Rise
A celebration of the damned
The unfettered few who choose to roam
Sharing more than sexual excess
Sowing more than vexing stones
Favourite haunts of depravation
Where the morning fears to tread
Covenant revere the sullen cain
Strike the tethered liar dead
Dark solstice fever burns in me
Like the tugging of my veins to feed
Ravaging Raven-Lust
Unbridled at dusk
Flowers lift your precious head to me
I have come to her warm embrace
The gentle touch of surreality
A sweet kiss from beloved faith
The gardens swim with fervent life tonight
I sense the beauty that waits for me there
Dancing with the statues in the pale moonlight
The velveret whisper at play with her hair
Thrill, kill the black cult
Walk among the weak by night
Affliction
Deep as any burial
Take their worthless lives
Pour submission into me
No church shall bar our paths
Seductive evil drink
your fill of the bleeding christ in your arms
Where scorn is fed in the blackest fucking soul!
From the primeval mass
Let precious chaos vent
Sacred flesh drenched in fornication
Beloved by Set
May the winds gather her together
From the secrets of men
After thousands of years of terrifying silence
She comes again
All Destroyer
The abolition of the yeshua begins
Shattered are the icons of the worthless
The Goddess scorned is a Valkyrie born
Scattered are the wings of the virulent holy
Leave their husks to be the prey of vultures and dogs
World without end
Cherish the lissome wants of pernicious evil
Dusk in her eyes
Torn bloody weeping skies
Darkness will hasten to devour
And the weak will flee or die
I slay the lamb in the fervour of thine
Abandonment unto Our Lady
With a quenchless thirst for the infinite
For Her that exists beyond all knowledge
Storming from tired centuries
Under the glare of a waxing death-moon
Terrible beauty of love severed
Rip the baby from the virginal womb
The blood of Jesus
Is the wine of the dead
And the drunken angels
Bleed with incest
The Liliot suckle on Her fruitful breasts
And yield the swords that sever and stain
There will be no act or passion wrought
That shall not be attributed to Her names
To the name of Baphomet.
I yearn to thee who art darkness in thy rising
Black candles dance to an overture
But I am drawn past their flickering lure
To the breathing forest that surrounds the room
Where the vigilant trees push out of the womb
I sip the blood-red wine
My thoughts weigh heavy with the burden of time
From knowledge drunk from the fountain of life
From Chaos born out of love and the scythe
The forest beckons with her nocturnal call
To pull me close amid the baying of wolves
Where the bindings of Christ are down-trodden with scorn
In the dark, odiferous earth
We embrace like two lovers at death
A monument to the trapping of breath
As restriction is bled from the veins of my neck
To drop roses on my marbled breast
I lust for the wind and the flurry of leaves
And the perfume of flesh on the murderous breeze
To learn from the dark and the voices between
This is my will
The forest whispers my name
again and again
The forest whispers my name
I walk the path
To the land of the Dark Immortals
Where the hungry ones will carry my soul
As the wild hunt careers through the boughs
Come to me, my Pale Enchantress
In the moon of the woods we kiss
Artemis be near me
In the arms of the ancient oak
Where daylight hangs by a lunar noose
And the horned, hidden one is re-invoked
The principle of Evil
Evolution has been recalled
Beneath the spread of a Magickal Aeon
I stand enthralled
In the whispering forest
Thee I invoke, bornless one
All woman, pure predator
Wherein conspiracy and impulse dwell
Like a seething fall from grace
Thee I worship
Thou art darkest Gabrielle
Lilith who rode the steed
Thou art pale Hecate
Rising from Thessaly
Crush their unworthy idols
No church shall bar our path
Seductive Evil, drink your fill
Of the bleeding Christ in your arms
You are in my dreams
The darkness in my eyes
The rapture in my screams
Black Goddess arise
Nothing will keep us apart
We could kill them all
If our desire tore free
Our union is one, sweet, sinful Eve
And the night draws in beside her
As we embrace the dark side by side
I pour my soul to those eyes full of fire
To harvest the seed ploughed inside her
Archangel, snare the flesh
Suck dry the ebbing wound
Leave them lifeless and broken
My beloved
Oh, how I have craved for you
You so pure and other-worldly with your scent of Winter
Am I to bleed myself dry just to see your delight?
And the fear retreats forever
Come to me
Black Goddess arise
When my secrets are buried in thine
Come to me
Black Goddess arise
Under seven stars we came together
Come to me 
Black Goddess arise
To plot the new age's decline
Come to me
Ishtar my Queen
Come forth to me
And help me seize
My future from the House of Death
That in the release of immortality
I should slay their fucking Nazarene
Hidden lusts will break the gates and swarm
As love secretes the thrill for war
The virgin raped shall seek to whore
She-wolf bare your snarling jaw
Caught in thy net of shadows,
What dreams hast thou to show?
Who treads the silent meadows,
To worship thee below?
Spells lay daggers before me
Passion speaks in grue vehement stabs
Trance my eyes, fix my focus to pain
The tumour grows until the enemy is slain
Gut The Church
Slightless storm
Knee-deep in hate I seeth
My purpose here has woken to breath
Total war on the brethren of Men
Millions regardless
Dying by my hand
A Black Age Of Fire
Brief in its vicious eloquence
Removing the dross
Love will arise from the ashes of your loss
Then and only then
Will the pleasure of Eden be mine
And the sinews of life itself will be tied
In the very veins of my bloodline
And their tears taste like wine
I will rule as a king
And the Goddess will sit as my guiding Queen
In the glory of the earth our crowns are studded
With the jewels of blasphemy
The blood is the life!
I seek to evoke a new order in Man
A flood of compulsion to resurrect Khem
The lion is vexed to uproot and descend
Chaos my steed in the thick, clinging dust
Tempering weapons of criminal lust
I hold sway from the East to fulfill prophecies
Thinning the cause as fresh cells to disease
The blood is the life!
Even the moon will not lend thee her light
The darkness serves will to snuff out human life
That I might reclaim the world as my right
I kill without scruple or silent regret
In haunts of the sinister lunar aspect
For I am the pleasure that comes from your pain
Tiny red miracles falling like rain
The incessant pall of death surrounds me
But this is not the part of me that wishes to breed
There will be no dread thereafter
The mysteries I reveal unto thee
I stir the hearts of the wisest
By the fools I will always be feared
My Kingdom feeds off their slaughter
A crescendo of passion bleeding
On the pale reflection of dawn
Devour The Sun
The Great Man of his time
Is He who expresses
The Will of his time;
Who tells his time what it wills;
And who carries it out
Crawl in awful stealth to me
Forever a voyeur I've been
Nocturnal Goddess of the Moon
So she comes, unseen
Thus speak
The burning seed, is thrust in Eve
And yearning keeps me, captive of desire
Make me as a flower that grows
Forever in your throne
That I might pollinate the world
With darkness as your own
Embrace me in spellbinding eyes
The fire of life that never dies
Tear deeper through my paper wounds
And never leave inside
Love shall consume and bathe the Lady
Whom I worship and ride thereon
She will greet me as a serpent
In her dark, secret Eden
And I will always want
For her witchcraft is
Desire
My soul is poisoned from within
I crawl with languid guilt to thee
Forever flushed in sin
Lamia, latria I give
My soul is poisoned from within
Wisdom breeds, fecundity
And her cunt she feeds, to fulfill her desire
To Eve I cum
Sevenfold my passion wrought
To ransack Eden, and to taste the whore
I cling beyond her sabled court
She is a gateway, to that darkness lost
Now dream
I am the gentle stream
That trickles through the summer glades
Of ever green peace
Therefore we will drink my sleep and dream
I am the bleeding sky,
The snatching wind of war
Blowing through the savage garden
My crown is fire, the erotic sinews of lust
Like strings to be pulled, and cut
I will make my puppets dance
The men will bow down before me
To take my flesh as lucid thoughts
Of dark, unbridled lust
I am all these things and more
Thus I await you, nemesis of restraint
The code of life, and the bride of evil itself
Oh, the fevered need for Her
When greed and lust are sharpened in that one desire
The all-consuming fire
Reveal to me your mysteries, Witch
The tree is plundered but I have the seed
To be sown in thee
We, the nocturnal few
Bound by other laws
To the service of the enemies of god
Are silent and hidden
Yet our exquisite fire burns on
Poised to engulf
Tie a man to his god
He may not walk for fear
Of falling foul to temptation
Where once faith stood her ground
Renounce the guilt, ignite the flame
Cast the fetid virgin back from where she came
Drink deep of the promise in my eyes
Of mist and midnight skies
I drown in fathomless dreams
And in the reeking mire of virtue scream
I yearn to sell my very soul
And you shall
For none so dark & sinister
Will arise to embrace the Arts
Do What Thou Will
Until the stones in my heart stand still
Regardless of the cost to your repugnant god
The last May frost may blight the crops
And will never be ascribed to be heavenly dog
Or nature, but infernal tasks
By your cursings and imprecations
You wrong both Man & beast
By whatever whim you serve
Of the Devil your leige
Tie belief to the trinity, and seven ways
Will be wrought to condemn thee
Conspiring to cull the pagan ways
Twist back their lies, personify their needs
The war begins by Satanic decree
If Evil we be, we will our lives
To mist and midnight skies
I will avenge the deaths of a thousand burning children
Be bound to a covenant with us in our hellish league
And bring the host of the Nazarene to their knees
Breath the life of an entity never-born
Darkness now descend in raven form
The words, the burning rasp, vibrate the cosmic thread
Arcturus is risen Queen, hold forth the severed head to me
I pour my lovelorn kisses at your feet
Raper of all my worldly enemies
Lycanthropy, please poison me
Send acausal instincts crawling through my brain
Take me, Mistress, until perversion is fed
Dark Magic pleasures weaved under the jewelled moon-head
The cross-stick will fade when the usurper hangs
For now we congregate where once my angel sang
That night they came and took her away from me
I lost the woman I loved and I learned how to curse
And to spit in the face of their Jesus fucking God
We will ride again
In the midnight skies
Oh, listen to them
The children of the night
What sweet music they make
May dreams be brought that I might reach
The gentle strains of midnight speech
And frozen stars that gild the forest floor
Through the swirling snow
Volkh's children come
To run with me, to hunt as one
To snatch the lambs of Christ
From where they fall
Through acrid clouds of summer flies
The garden swells with a thousand more wise
Forever flung to celestial dreams
Clawing at the grave of the dead Nazarene
I watch the storm approaching
The darkness calls my name
The trees are growing restless
They feel the season change
Their fruit has putrified
Forbidden once and bound to die
The thread of life lies severed
On the brink of paradise
Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Dash towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch her veil
Reclamation, our time has come
Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies
They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?
Will they know of majesty
Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their "god" of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from Chaos roused for war?
WAR!
Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end
We are what we are, what we shall be, again
Appear; draped in terror
To the comfort of your kin
Stain the milky sunset red
And let the others in
Summer's dying
Swords in hand at the bloody fields of history
We rend our blades through dogma and humility
Carve the future according to our will
Set worlds ablaze with our seething fire
Let you all acknowledge that we are here
As masters to rule this failing humanity
Our beings formed in rage and defiance
With strength to trample the weak and the foolish
And so we march with burning brands
Temples of flame on our path to glory
Rise, ablaze, libidinous
Ascend to smother the light
Chaos is spat
From the black eternal sea
Serrated mountains of mad shadows
Carving towards misdeed
Stormchoirs gather
A pestilential hiss
Sunset evokes Luciferian fire
The skies are ruptured like a knifed orifice
Supernal vestments hang tattered
Cathedrals shriek to pulpit oratory
Invasions scale Babel's ivory towers
Poised to sodomise a world upon it's knees
Victory spent
Breathe deep benighted scent
We are as a flame born unto the darkness
Desires burning in palatial glades
And virtues once aloof, now worming beneath us
Shalt see their children, pleasuring as slaves
Attack!
Wreak atrocities on those we have despised
Judgements be riven, from the skies
Darkness empower let us master prophecy
Fulfilling destiny
the promised fever
Bedizens eyes paralysed with blasphemy
Written in flesh across the howling ether
Artemis
Spread the bliss of this Lupercalia
With stars erased, throw wide the gates
The infidel soon unmasks her face
Neath silken shroud she waxes horn
Sharpened to skewer dawn
I am as a plague, born to the priestess
The secret amour of her archangelic rape
Jaded-eyed when my lovers, possessed
Screamed out their agonies, upon the stake
The most August sorcerers of Hades
Darkly seized for me a throne
And the upraised scythe so terribly scribed
Vengeance in Jesuit blood on stone
From this ransacked celestial temple
I hold the prophet's severed head unto all nations
Tremble before us
Lords of the star-veiled red sepulchres
Rushing deathwards, our Tartarean fires
Kindle pandemonia to furnace the earth
Our voices are opened graves
Through which the never-dead escape
From dank, abyssic dream
Pursuing ascendancy
The enemy has held three seasons
Imparadised, whilst we writhed
To psycho-dramas penned by aerial decree
Now freed to plunder
Heaven torn asunder
Candelabra snuffed prey
silhouette wedded
Nightfall take my hand
Seduce me with silky timbred limbs
Grant me thy dark command
Over the peaks framing tapestries
Of thick forest, dusk has filled
With Lucifugous kisses enwreathed in mist
Creeping like violations from the shadows
to kill
Lucretia
is my love in vein
When thy tears bleed sweeter
Thank the midsummer rain?
Bewinged, infested belfries
Toll o'er the sobbing throng
A writhe of lethargic, terrored nudes
Whipped and welted neath the barbed windsong
in saddean paradise
Ancestral legacies linger on
I am He
The crowned and conquering darkness
Satan robed in ecumenical filth
This wintry eve when the snow glistens deep
And sharpened turrets wed the jewelless skies
I shrug off the shroud of preternatural sleep
Enbroided by these words Malaresia scribed
Beauty slept and angels wept
For Her immortal soul
In this repose, all evil chose
To claim her for their very own
Carpathia
The pleasured dead speak of her
In necromantic tongue
When ambered daylights are done
Masterbating in their graves
On her zenith to come
This catafalque night when awed stars report
Their absence from the heavenly brow
Crippled seraph shalt cower in illustrious courts
Whilsts the cloaked maelstrom resounds throughout
How the storm it fulfills
My heart though unhealed
Celestial knifes ebonied
And wild woods thrill
Yet far fiercer still
Her lustre eviscerates me
Carpathia
Priapic lovers twist in concert with Her
Covenants are struck, jagged lightning fellates
The path towards the castle weary innocence takes
I rule as Master here
Where feral hordes impart my temper
Love sank wounded when I, betrayed
saw death etch cruelly, upon my lineage
Usher the spite seething Draconist
And commit this world to thy ancient
sovereignty
Erunescent veil descend
Psalmed sunset thus portends
And laid to rest, I now am blessed
With this darkness
Forever more
Supreme Vampiric Evil
Evening minuetto in a castle by the sea
A jewel more radiant than the moon
Lowered Her mask to me
The sublimest creature the Gods, full of fire
Would marvel at making their Queen
Infusing the air with Her fragrant desire
And my heart reeled with grave poetry
From grace I fell in love with Her
Scent and feline lure
And jade woodland eyes that ushered in the impurest
Erotic, laden fantasies amid this warm Autumn night
She lulled me away from the rich masquerade
And together we clung in the bloodletting moonlight
Pearled luna, what spell didst thou cast on me?
Her icy kiss fervoured my neck
Like whispering waves upon Acheron's beach
In a whirl of sweet voices and statues
That phantomed the dying trees
This debauched seductress in black, took me
In a pale azured dawn like Ligeia reborn
I tore free of my sleep-sepulchre
On the sea misted lawn where stone figures, forlorn
Lamented the spectre of Her
Bewildered and weak, yet with passion replete
I hungered for past overtures
The curse of unrest and her ardent caress
Came much more than my soul could endure
I, at once endeavoured to see Her again
Stirring from midnight's inertia
Knowing not even her name
On a thin precipice over carnal abyss
I danced like a blind acolyte
Drunk on red wine, her dead lips on mine
Suffused with the perfume of night
For hours I scoured the surrounding grounds
In vain that we might meet
When storm clouds broke, ashened, fatigued
I sought refuge in a cemeterty
Sleep, usher dreams
Taint to nightmares from a sunless nether
Mistress of the dark
I now know what thou art
Screams haunt my sleep
Dragged from nightmares thou hast wed together
Spawned thee leche
To snare my flesh
Portrait of the Dead Countess
Deep stained pain that I had dreamt
Flaunted demise, life's punishment
Leaving little strength to seal this wretched tomb
But poised nectar within my stirs
Up feverous desire and morbid purpose to search
Through cobwebbed drapery to where she swoons
Goddess of the graveyard, of the tempest and moon
In flawless fatal beauty her very visage compels
Glimpses of a heaven where ghost companies fell
To mourning the loss of god in blackest velvet
Enrobed in their downfall like a swift silhouette
Fleeting, enshadowed
Thou art privy to my sin
Secrets dead, wouldst thou inflict
The cruel daylights upon my skin?
Dost thou not want to worship me
With crimson sacrifice
So my cunt may twitch against thy kiss
And weep with new-found life?
Red roses for the Devil's whore
Dark angels taste my tears
And whisper haunting requiems
Softly to mine ear
Need-fires have lured abominations here
Nocturnal pulse
My veins spill forth their waters
Rent by lips I cherish most
Awash on her perfidious shores
Where drowning umbra o'er the stars
Ebon's graves where lovers whore
Like seraphim and Nahemah
Pluck out mine eyes, hasten, attest
Blind reason against thee, Enchantress
For I must know, art thou not death?
My heart echoes bloodless and incensed
Doth temptation prowl night in vulvic revelry
Did not the Queen of Heaven come as Devil to me?
On that fatal Hallow's Eve when we fled company
As the music swept around us in the crisp, fated leaves
UNder horned Diana where her bloodline was sewn
In a graveyard of Angels rent in cool marbled stone
I am grieving the loss of life in sombre velvet
Enrobed in Death's shadow like a swifter silhouette
Weak midnight promises of love
Were wept upon Her grave
And shunned by stars above
In mortal life lurks my dismay
An Angel stole my heart
and Death took Her away
She sleeps beyond the grace of god
A dreaming beauty
If wishes could only fray that bond
The dead would sing for me
Twelfth moon arose with ghostly voice
A poet's serenade
Her name a whisper 'pon my lips
Fear me not my grieving King
Funereal in breath
The secrets of the dark I know
And thus, we shall cheat Death
My promises wrought though despondence that night
Have delivered me gifts from the grave
Rorasa enshadowed and eternal life
Never a Devil so vain
The Angel is fallen, for I thought her lost
And no heaven would silence the pain
Teach me these secrets, the sensual frost
Desire for warm blood again
Princess lay down thy florid cheek
In drunken splendour
Tonight rare regal fate has cast
The wolves among the sheep
Dark nature clasp my soul
Around Her throat mine arms enfold
To sleep, perchance to dream
And then
To dusk and flesh ascend
The Sun descends, magenta spirits fill the skies
and wreak erotic maladies where sex and Death abide
From writhing tides where gothick siren weave their song to shore
Through the ashes of the battlefields where ravens and angels war
We rule like the red and risen moon upon the sea
The stars of judgement silent, for we share joyous
Eternity
Damnation
Salvation
Stigmata plague
The wine of Bacchus flows
Listen to the thunder rage
Deceivers dragged before their cross
I am He that vanquished Death
And bore the sting of loss
What vulgar christ will unprise my grasp?
His temple, ruined, burns
And sweet Rorasa laughs
I am enamoured and imparadised
To catch the fires dancing profanely in her eyes
I will crush them all
If this holds thy delight
Rather dead forever than to lose her
Nymph-lascivious Aphrodite
Take away the wine
For restlessness plagues me
I am assailed by a spectre profounder
Than hatred and grief or the sum of their hideous crime
I shalt suffer this confessional mime
Awaiting the sun to set, crimsoning seas
Only once it is dark doth my misery cease
She died to a sky dressed in flame
Eyes full of curses for her killers by choice
Who fell to their god o'er her vision and voice
I am as dusk come to ravish the light
Steal me from their stares and mute christ into night
I will answer thy prayers
If thou Wouldst drink of my life
Encroaching evening skies
Die with such tragedy
And those interred in cold graves
Dwell on pleasures to be
In deep hysteria
Where our legend still breathes
Through sweet death and thereafter
Sweeping nightmares shall feed
When the sun has wept upon the waveless lake
And the mists steal in with ease
Covened wolves are their eerie dissonant napes
In adoration of the moon and thee
They call as I to thee
And I will come, as if in dream
My languid, dark and lustrous Malaresian Queen
Of vengeful, ancient breed
Gilded with the pelts of many enemies
Erishkigal, raven-haired
Thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
I can taste thy scent by candlelight
Legs of porcelain traced and laced to their lair
Appease the beast on spattered sheets
Dyed unearthly red as sobriety weeps
Nocternity
She shall come for me
A black velvet painting sprung to elegant life
Like a poignant Madonna perverted to night
And I have ridden from the westerning light
To expend my lust
Tear away the funereal dress
Know that I will escape from my death
Surrendered to the splendour of her sharpened caress
Lo! The pale moonlight
Weaves a poetic spell of vital death and decline
Of mist and moth and the hunger inside
Kisses took to fever and the fever, demise
Through twilight, darkness and moonrise
My scarlet tears will run
As stolen blood and whispered love
Of fantasies undone
Countess swathed in ebony
And snow-white balletic grace
Rouge-filmed lips procure the wish
For lust and her disgrace
Dusk and her embrace
We shall flit through the shadows
Like a dream of werewolves in the snow
Under deadly nightshade
Still warmed with the kill's afterglow
Beneath the stars thy flesh bedevils me
Beneath the stars taste the death in me
Bequeath to me thy fiery kiss
To sever thin mortality
Elizabeth
My heart is thine
Thy fragrant words Warm within like wine
Let me come to thee
With eyes like Asphodel
Moon-glancing, loose desires free
To writhe under my spell
Ereshkigal, raven-haired
Thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
I know thy scent by candlelight
Immortal flesh I yearn to share
Appease the beast on spattered sheets
Dyed malefic red as sobriety weeps
Nocternity
She shall come for me
Unfurl thy limbs breathless succubus
How the full embosomed fog
Imparts the night to us
Death, spirit me away
My anguished soul doth strain
On taut and twisted reins
Yet, insatiate I still remain
Like a proud, unfalled star
That dares thee from afar
To calm my thund'rous heart
Else, rend it's knots apart
So I may never sing
Of jewelled skies o'er my strings
And love, a wanton thing
Can plunge on burnt, black wings
To hang amid the thorns
In scarlet, like velvet worn
About the clouded moon
Who wanes in solitude
I am alone
Thirsting for the dark
That lurks beneath marbled stone
What black witchcraft
Shalt prise thee from thy dreams
And what perverse world-strategy
Will wend it's way with thee from sleep?
Rouse my disease
And with cadent naked dance I shalt teach
Thee wisdom of darkness
From earth and red sea
Lightbearing Samael
Coalesce with me
Twilight
Through pagan city gates
Bred shadows play like twining snake
By candlelight
Thanateros rites
Death seduced and chaos wakes
Obsession grips, blindragon fever
In throes of scythed orgasm, Eros dies
And Saturn rapes faith's lovelorn Diva
Upon a cyprean altar, stripped bare for sacrifice
Virtue births a demon
Pandora's box, unhinged, sets loose the night
Winged lilith born for want of Eden
Fanning plumes of harlotry
Like pearls before the desert swine
The skies, they darken
And the oceans part
Storm forth indignant Kraken
Reborn Venus as thou art
Feasting at my banquet
Of Saturnalia
I call thee having wrestled
The tides from lonely Diana
For thee Endymion
I forsake the cerements of this star-flung tomb
Be-with-us come
Unveil the ancient flame
Throw the cats our enemies
Desire's menstrual strain
Eastern Devil eyes
A cruel erotic plague
The Shekhina is in exile
And the Israelites enslaved to shame
Midnight
Jerusalem
A tenebrous phantasy
Revelates to men
Their celestial walls crumble
When walks the Xul
Born to the scarlet whore in Babylon
The centuries of wait have all but gone
Behold dark beauty stirs to conquer on and on
Now worship Everything
Herodias and I have led a phantom cavalcade
Through veiled and pagan history where superstitions reigned
And Christendom sought to pervert, but poets of my name
Sang of penumbral victories that sorcery had claimed
The Graal and mighty Caliburn as votive offerings
To an England rearisen under vast majestic wings
These are the shores whereto my soul
Blood drenched and unredeemed
Shalt seek solace in secrets told
Through the whispers of a dream
From the woods Pendragon-born, I rose Arcturius
A proud, audacious King mantled in the
vehemence of lust
Death and destiny undaunted me, I drew a throne divided
In awe of the glorious battles won, my dark Goddess provided
Then treachery, a wingless beast, came crawling to my court
And now I lie at cursed Camlann, from wounds a traitor wrought
I fear the Augean light
is sweeping through Camelot
How bittersweet my triumphs seem,
now Autumnal leaves succumb to frost
Morganna art thou near me?
Languid, I wend my path to grave
Cast my sword to the sulphyd grasp
Of the naiad neath the silvered lake
When waters stirred lay silent
Mistress let the mists descend
Thy tears cannot thaw Death's cold heart
His sombre gaze defies legend
More so than thine, else thy dew-lidded eyes
Art for the Banshees song
Or our souls entwined like vein upon
The haunted shores of Avalon
Bury me in velvet dream
Lest I unduly wake
And seek to reconcile my thirst
With the cowardly tailors of my fate
Unleash mastiffs of snarling night
To overthrow, plague and burn
As slumber lures me 'mongst the dead
To scheme of my return
Archaic ghostly echoes breathe like thunder of the storm
A tempest fools miscall divine as they crouch awaiting dawn
Their ignorance has forged for me over
centuries a sword
Burnished to flash like lightning on the precipice of war
The wolves are dead in Albion whilst the
passive flocks roam free
This my penetrant spearhead shalt pierce these foul,
trespassing breeds
I have awoken from the past
Glenfully with the shadows over England's bitter skies
I prize mine wounds in a soil sweated drink
Remember me as king when I cradle hell to stars
Like lovers in my arms, nestled vipers to my breast
Venom forces workthius arts of devil's and priestess
Thus I shall rule anew through the sinews of a song
Played upon a storm
By the ghosts of Avalon
And all in league will bow to me, from death they shall ascend
To whisper weals of war to stir the dark one in men
The principle black metal masterplan

The Life of all Flesh Is The Blood
Those who Trespass against us, Beware the Shadows of Dusk
Unshadow thyselves children
The reign in flesh begins again...
Empire
Funereal majesty awake
wreathed in snake
Draconis talons rake
So haunted is my silent heart
Dreaming only of the moon
When velvet darkness falls tonight
The thirst crescends anew
Only for you
Inspired to mortal nightmare
Ebony dressed for sunset
In the dulcet whispers of the damned
Black candles dance to an overture
But I am drawn past their flickering lure
To the breathing forest that surrounds the room
Where the vigilant trees push out of the womb
I sip the blood-red wine
My thoughts weigh heavy with the burden of time
From knowledge drunk from the fountain of life
From Chaos born out of love and the scythe
The forest beckons with her nocturnal call
To pull me close amid the baying of wolves
Where the bindings of Christ are down-trodden with scorn
In the dark, odiferous earth
We embrace like two lovers at death
A monument to the trapping of breath
As restriction is bled from the veins of my neck
To drop roses on my marbled breast
I lust for the wind and the flurry of leaves
And the perfume of flesh on the murderous breeze
To learn from the dark and the voices between
This is my will
The forest whispers my name
again and again
When the moon is full
We shall assemble to adore
The potent spirit of your Queen,
My mother great Diana.
She who fain would learn all sorcery
Yet has not won its deepest secrets,
Them my mother will
Teach her, in truth
All things as yet unknown
I walk the path
To the land of the Dark Immortals
Where the hungry ones will carry my soul
As the wild hunt careers through the boughs
Come to me, my Pale Enchantress
In the moon of the woods we kiss
Artemis be near me
In the arms of the ancient oak
Where daylight hangs by a lunar noose
And the horned, hidden one is re-invoked
The principle of Evil
Evolution has been recalled
Beneath the spread of a Magickal Aeon
I stand enthralled
In the whispering forest
Even a man who is pure in the heart
And speaks in prayer by night
May become a wolf when the wolf's bane blooms
And the winter moon is bright
Listen to them
The children of the night
What sweet music they make
Iniquitous
I share Carmilla's mask
A gaunt mephitic voyeur
On the black side of the glass
Peering through the mirror
Deep dark and ominous
Consorting themes, demons I weave
Subservience from thee to lost
I am Corinthian light
A snake in flowers by night
The last temptation of christ
Evil in mortal
Disguise the guilt
Sharp-eyed, impassive whore
Burn the asafoetida
and rank petriachor
Lure me panthered Faustia
With cunt and veiled womb
To prowl thy inner sanctum walls
In Tirgoviste to resume
Control
Seduction, my obsessive art
A pantheon of tragedies inscribed upon the stars
Like thistled ruin, garbed around thy heart
Bacchanal Cinderella, desirious midnight passed
Leaving thee as sacrifice asleep within my arms
'Midst dreams od robed redemption versed in sexual aftermath
When we ebb as tides together, carnal souls entwined
And orgasms expire, come puppet wires and the blind
Purge
Fires work in me
A lithe supremacy
I tear asunder heaven as I would all enemies
Impaler Lord
Flesh upon the sword
My lower lusts are sated, the greater herald war
I am thirst, spearheaded hunger
Sacrament and pain
Nails raked in savagery
When the cruel Countessa came
Exalt!
The Queen of death-white winter enthroned
Evil resplendent, in dusk red seething skies
Foam-flecked nightmares drag a moon
Of Draconian design
A love that never dies
Nefarious silhouettes to rise
When stars fall pale
And to drown back in Her eyes
Is to madden ghosts within
To unhinge a thousand sins
From Death's dark vale
Blessed be these spells of winter
Unto us that wait with patience in
This secret garden
To storm our way into another
As yes undone
Surge
Desert claims Eden
And Hyperborean
Visions of Utopia are driven from the sun
Iconoclast
Before thee angels clasped
In nakedness their ochre flesh
Shall yield to thy advance
She is all to me
Mysterious, alive
The howling in the deep woods
When cold festal stars aligned
A lurid moon looms; phosphorent, evil
Yesod vested in despotic upheaval
Silvering wolves that scarlet forest snow
Forgotten ones as above, so below
The trees groan aghast as ghostly pallored clouds are rent
When the drunken earth heaves, sweep aside seas to ascend
From Sheol's dank haunted wilderness
Thy seal upon Nuit's starry vault to incense the sleepers,
dead
Queen of Winter, throned
The murderess lurked in vulgar caresses
Vestal masturbation
Purity Overthrown
Darkness
In raven feathered dress
Sides with Death at chess
Their pawns are many and the enemy
Powerless
When the miscreants fell dead
She took to conjuring spells in the cusp of the night
And the bestial floor shook with terrible life
I rise before thee Queen
To feed our lusts on the blood of the weak
To rule heaven and worlds crawling beneath
Satanic Tyranny
Weak midnight promises of love
Were wept upon Her grave
And shunned by stars above
In mortal life lurks my dismay
An Angel stole my heart
and Death took Her away
She sleeps beyond the grace of god
A dreaming beauty
If wishes could only fray that bond
The dead would sing for me
Twelth moon arose with ghostly voice
A poet's serenade
Her name a whisper upon my lips
And lo, Rorasa came
Fear me not my grieving King
Funereal in breath
The secrets of the dark I know
And thus, we shall cheat Death
My promises wrought though despondence that night
Have delivered me gifts from the grave
Rorasa enshadowed and eternal life
Never a Devil so vain
The Angel is fallen, for I thought her lost
And no heaven would silence the pain
Teach me these secrets, the sensual frost
Desire for warm blood again
Princess lay down thy florid cheek
In drunken splendour
Tonight rare regal fate has cast
The wolves among the sheep
Dark nature clasp my soul
Around Her throat mine arms enfold
To sleep, perchance to dream
And then
To dusk and flesh ascend
The Sun descends, magenta spirits fill the skies
and wreak erotic maladies where sex and Death abide
From writhing tides where gothick siren weave their song to shore
Through the ashes of the battlefields where ravens and angels war
As phantoms we have fled the basilisk of day
To rise as phoenix taloned, nightly taking prey
We rule like the red and risen moon upon the sea
The stars of judgement silent, for we share joyous
Eternity
Damnation
Salvation
Stigmata plague
The wine of Bacchus flows
Listen to the thunder rage
Deceivers dragged before their cross
I am He that vanquished Death
And bore the sting of loss
What vulgar christ will unprise my grasp?
His temple, ruined, burns
And sweet Rorasa laughs
I am enamoured and imparadised
To catch the fires dancing profanely in her eyes
I will crush them all
If this holds thy delight
Rather dead forever than to lose her
Nymph-lascivious Aphrodite
Hasten to the bridal bed
Underneath the grave 'tis spread:
In darkness may our love be hid,
Oblivion be our coverlid
We may rest, and nione forbid.
Invading tempestuous skies
When Inanna rose, bringing angels repose
And Narcissus' date as their prize
Blinded by Diana's mirror
Wherein coffined truth struggles, forlorn
And covetous stars out their eyes to deceive
The horrors performed on Her shores
As jewelled Ishtar, in darker Aeons
Trespassed Ereshkigal's grasp
Her ravening twin, wreathed in whispers and wind
Now inspires Catharsis to dance
Through the weave of white vaults
Where the shadows revolt
At the incest of spiritual love
Castrata choirs, bereft of such lusts
Spatter virginal breasts with their blood
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve
Thirst-ridden Wolves serenade a moon
Who seems no mistress of Herself
And heavens pour forth vast casualties
Thy host given up for me
Thou which wert once and then ceased to be
Art now ensconced to chapters
Of a lengthening tragedy
Whilst we scream free
Deep forests impale the sinister mist
Their sorcery taught to the clouds
Who muster like mountains, a fountainous wish
To vex the sweet dead from silk odious shrouds
Storm-woken sisters of Judas unfurl
As Psyche to Sapphic lament
Wrapt in thy tresses and taloned caresses
Whisper me secrets beheld beyond Death
Desires
I was loath to lose
To the virgin-bloodied priests
Whose lord fantasied on Magdalene
And sought to savour Her as a beast
Her aching sex
A rose undone
As mine in tears and spasms wrung
has built thee a marbled stair
By candlelight to Eden and Serpentine throne
Where ravens rape the tenanting angels there
Hurry, else Death may spy us here
And quicken the pulse of dawn
Embering flames writhe to life again
The starry brow threshed with poisonous thorn
Huntress, draw back the silvered bow
Thy dogs set upon the manger
The enemy in throes
Whilst drifting fogs devour
All Hallows witching hour
On this long, dark seance for the soul
Through malevolent Scylla, Charybdis graves
Our conquesting spirits pour forth, unassuaged
Occultnesses watch us and Seraph, afraid
Like fireflies lounge to Her maw, midst crashing black waves
Remember with pride what thou art
Lest we forget in awe of our terrible past
When Dark royalties drank of despair
Idols hewed down beneath a desert god's stare
In thrall to revenges sworn there
What dreams could we father, when farther we fell
To nightmare
Well versed in misery
We have lain naked in darkest ravines
Now the sun has set in slumber, We delight
Like serpents in arousal
Coiled to strike at the light
Now abyssed Lucifer's master the earth
Uncloister jaded harlots once served
Enthralled by cruel raptures, rehearsed
Kiss slumbered beauty and weapon our thousand year curse
The laughter of Khaos
Gatekeepers flee the onslaught
A World enslaved to flame
Bondage in Phallustine
Pleasure temples for my bride
Nubian grace swiftly seize
Thieves blood-divine
Empires thrive on sacrifice
Spawned wanton like blight on an auspicious night
Her eyes betrayed spells of the moon's eerie light
A disquieting gaze forever ghosting far seas
Bled white and dead, Her true mother was fed
To the ravenous wolves that the elements led
From crag-jagged mountains that seemingly grew in unease
Through the maw of the woods, a black carriage was drawn
Flanked by barbed lightning that hissed of the storm
Gilded in crests of Carpathian breed
Bringing slaves to the sodomite for the new-born
On that eve when the Countess' own came deformed
A tragedy crept to the name Bathory
Elizabeth christened, no paler a rose
Grew so dark as this sylph
None more cold in repose
Yet Her beauty spun webs
Round hearts a glance would betroth
She feared the light
So when She fell like a sinner to vice
Under austere, puritanical rule
She sacrificed
Mandragora like virgins to rats in the wall
But after whipangels licked prisoners, thralled
Never were Her dreams so maniacally cruel
And possessed of such delights
For ravens winged Her nightly flights
Of erotica
Half spurned from the pulpit
Torments to occur
Half learnt from the cabal of demons
In Her
Her walk went to voodoo
To see Her own shadow adored
At mass without flaw
Though inwards She abhored
Not Her coven of suitors
But the stare of their Lord
I must avert mine eyes to hymns
For His gaze brings dogmas to my skin
He knows that I dreamt of carnal rites
With Him undead for three long nights
Elizabeth listened
No sermons intoned
Dragged such guilt to Her door
Tombed Her soul with such stone
For She swore the Priest sighed
When She knelt down to atone
She feared the light
So when She fell
Like a sinner to vice
Under austere, puritanical rule
She sacrificed
Her decorum as chaste
To this wolf of the cloth
Pouncing to haunt
Her confessional box
Forgiveness would come
When Her sins were washed off
By rebaptism in white
The looking glass cast Belladonna wreaths
upon the grave of Her innocence
Her hidden face spat murder
From a whisper to a scream
All sleep seemed cursed
In Faustian verse
But there in orgiastic Hell
No horrors were worse
Than the mirrored revelation
The She kissed the Devil's phallus
By Her own decree
So with windows flung wide to the menstrual sky
Solstice Eve She fled the castle in secret
A daughter of the storm, astride Her favourite nightmare
On winds without prayer
Stigmata still wept between Her legs
A cold bloodedness which impressed new hatreds
She sought the Sorceress
Through the snow and dank woods to the sodomite's lair
Nine twisted fates threw hewn bone die
For the throat of Elizabeth
Damnation won and urged the moon
In soliloquy to gleam
Twixt the trees in shafts
To ghost a path
Past the howl of buggered nymphs
In the sodomite's grasp
To the forest's vulva
Where the witch scholared Her
In even darker themes
Amongst philtres and melissas
Midst the grease of strangled men
And eldritch truths, elder ill-omen
Elizabeth came to life again
And under lacerations of dawn She returned
Like a flame unto a deathshead
With a promise to burn
Secrets brooded as She rode
Through mist and marsh to where they showed
Her castle walls wherein the restless
Counted carrion crows
She awoke from a fable to mourning
Church bells wringing Her madly from sleep
Tolled by a priest, self castrated and hung
Like a crimson bat beneath the belfry
The biblical prattled their mantras
Hexes six-tripled their fees
But Elizabeth laughed, thirteen Autumns had passed
And She was a widow from god and His wrath, finally
Hear Me now!
All crimes should be treasured if they bring thee pleasure somehow
Maleficent in dusky rose
Gathered satin lapped Her breasts
Like blood upon the snow
A tourniquet of Topaz
Glistened at Her throat
Awakening, pulled from the tomb
Her spirit freed eclipsed the moon
That She outshone as a fallen star
A regal ornament from a far flung nebular
Her likeness hung in the black gallery
Commanding unease
Demanding of Death to breathe
Midst the whirl and daylight fauna
Of society at court
Elizabeth bedazzled, Her presence sought applause
Though Her torchlit shadow
Thrown upon damp cellar walls
Greeted nothing but despair from slaves Her nights enthralled
Thirteen Winter solstices had shown
Her path, that the dark
Had marked its dominion
Spaying the confessor
Whose caresses she'd known,
As whipcord in the House of Dog
Her cold cunt meat on holy bone
Raped of faith, She now embraced
The narcissistic unrest frozen on the mirror's face
With this disdain, inside these veins
Highborn wanton that She was
She sought to keep what age would claim
Her soul was sold and for this toll
Reeking pyres ever smouldered
On the whims of one so in control
Elizabeth, mysterious.
Cruelty brought thee orchids
From the bowels of the abyss
Once upon atrocity when midwitches stifled cries
And carved abortive runes in reddened wombs
Exhumed by scrying eyes
Madness came upon
Her like an amourous lover's seed
Lifesblood splashed upon Her skin
In gouts torture unleashed
And to Her dead reflection
Twas as if Her pallor gleamed
Like an angel's warmed by candles
Where erotic stains had cleaved
So demons dragged this libertine
Lusts screaming for release
Upon the flesh of maidens preened
As canvas for caprice
Exacting obeisance
Her gaze held a seance
Of spirits too trapped under glass to commune
A sleeter mistress than Luna
Whose threats to consume Her
Met with torments giving vent to Her swoon
Flat on Her back
Pack-prey for the reams
Of verses and curses
That haunted Her dreams
Midnightmare chimed
Thirteen in Her mind
A disciple of scars
Branded years hissed behind
Ridden split-thighed
By the Father of lies
An ovation of wolves
Blushed the skies as they writhed
But Heaven is never forever
She came, a spent storm
From the clouds
Leaving serpents in office
Inside every gate
To lick righteous holes
Blinding Lords to the fate
Of virgins forced naked
To defile on rent knees
Hacked and racked backwards
Menses choking their pleas
More. Whore. More.
Twitching make me wet with thee
Carcass rub me raw
And to Her dead reflection
Twas as if Her pallor gleamed
Like an angel's warmed by candles
Where erotic stains had cleaved
So demons dragged this libertine
Lusts screaming for release
Upon the flesh of maidens preened
As canvas for caprice
Raped of faith, She now embraced
The narcissistic unrest frozen on the mirror's face
With this disdain, inside these veins
Highborn wanton that She was
She sought to keep what age would claim
Her soul was sold and for this toll
Reeking pyres ever smouldered
On the whims of one so in control
Elizabeth, mysterious.
Cruelty brought thee orchids
From the bowels of the abyss
From the bowels of the abyss
Midwinter wrongs the rites of Spring
Her spinal chill rakes the earth
Whilst pensive souls at zero sing
Woebetidings of rebirth
Under cold stares of Mars maligned
Near-suicides cross their hearts
And unborns writhe in tepid brine
For something wicked this way starts
Beneath the howling stars
Elizabeth, paragon of vice
Watches the sun set pyres alight
As Bane and Tyranny, Her Dobermans sleep
Like spellbound paramours at Her feet
A chatter of bells without
Raise hellhounds, teeth on edge
From sleighs hastened through snow lit red
Guests espied from the garret ledge
Great gloomy mirror tell Her face
She will outblind them all
That heavenly bodies would fall from grace
To possess such a lustrous pall
For beauty is always Cruel
For beauty is always
Let destiny in chains commence
Damnation under Gods seeking recompense
Enslaving to the whims of this mistress
As the dance ensued
Elizabeth's mood
Tempered by the craft of a vitreous moon
In slick black iciness it grew
To consume
The wench Her tower tombed
Tending to Her costume
Bore the brunt of the storm
When the needle askewed
She has Her dogs maul the bitch's wrists through
Restored to jaded bliss
This evisceratrix
Descended to the ball
With painted blood upon Her lips
Passing like a comet so white
As to eclipse
The waltz wound down, transfixed
Devoid of all breath in the air
Even Death paled to compare
To the taint of Her splendour
So rare and engendered
upon the awed throng gathered
There
Beneath the howling stars
She danced so macabre
Men entranced divined from Her gait
That this angel stepped from a pedestal
Had won remission from fate
By alighting to darker spheres
Delighting in held sway
For She was not unlike the Goddess
To whom the wolves bayed
Whilst envy glanced daggers
From court maidens, arboured
Who whispered in sects
Of suspicions abroad
That Elizabeth bewitched
See how even now the whore casts
Her spells upon the Black Count
Whom Her reddened lips hold fast
Tongue unto tongue
Swept on tides without care
For the harpies who rallied
Their maledict glares
A halo of ravens tousled Her hair
Chandeliers a tiara
For passions ensnared
Phantasies sexed
When their eyes, moonstruck met
Their friction wore a way
Through the sea of foreplay
Lovers at first bite
She an Eve tempted to lay
Gasping at rafters
Flesh pressed in ballet
But caprice, honours leashed
She absconded the feast
To prowl wonderland
Beasts in hand from the Keep
Of Feudal dilemma
Well mantled in furs
Through cullis to watch
Dogstars howl at the earth
On this violent night
Unholy night
Winds lashed their limbs together
As the ether vent its wintry spite
She wished His kiss on Her frozen landscapes
To excite the bleak advance
From castle bowers
Wherein small hours
The Devil never came by chance
A lone charm tied to Her inner thigh
Sent lusts nova as hooves trod
Cobbled streets where lowlives fleet
Were flung to a wayward god
Midwinter wrongs the rites of Spring
Her spinal chill rakes the earth
Whilst pensive souls at zero sing
Woebetidings of rebirth
Under cold stares of Mars maligned
Near-suicides cross their hearts
And unborns writhe in tepid brine
For something wicked this way starts
Beneath the howling stars
Pounding upon the pauper ridge
Earshot of a hunched beldame
Elizabeth teased, would He dare to please
Such elderly loins enflamed?
To this He feigned a grim disdain
Playing to Her slayful eye
But the hag replied
This girl that chides
Will soon be as plagued with age as I
Her consort laughed a plume of icy breath
For Elizabeth's grace could raise
A flag of truce in burning heaven
Or the dead from early graves
Yet still She seethed
This proud Snow Queen
Embittered with the cursed retort
And because He sought Her loves onslaught
He gutted the crone for sport
Soon in full moon fever they were wed
Lycanthropic in the conjugal bed
Littered with aphrodisiacs
To tease dynastic union
And beget them further maniacs
Elizabeth
Free reigned, now a Countess
Outwielded and outwore
Her title like a favoured dress
Whilst Her errant Lord
Whose seasons savoured war
Stormed black to fell the infidel
Her embers, tempered, roared.
Nights came tralling ghost concertos
Heartstrings a score of skeletal reaper bows
Playing torture chamber music allegretto
Conducting over throes trashed to crescendo
Skinless the dark shall scream
Hoarse Her symphonies
Deathmashed as the moon
That had lifted Her dreams
And frowned on the winding steps down
To where the vulgar strayed,
Taunting sick Her tender prey
She glided in Her bridal gown
How sleep the pure
Desire in Violent Overture
An emanation of phantom madness
The Countess beheld in shroud
By girls bereft of future vows
Soon to wed in white the frosted ground
Burning like a brand on the countenance of god
A yearning took Her hand to His Seraphim, bound
Deep red hissed the cat whips
On the whim of ill-will
Whilst She entranced, nonchalant, abliss
Flayed further songs of overkill
How weep the pure
Desire in Violent overture
In a crescent-whime cellar of crushed roses
Pooled blood and broken dolls
A torchlit shadow theatre souled
With the echoed cries of lives She stole
Killing time
She struck the hours dead
In Her control
Thus menopaused
Her clock of hacked out cunts
Began to toll
Thirteen chimes of ancient strain
I conjure forth with dirge
That fills the void with timbred pain
To fulfil my sexual urge
Frights came wailing from the Darkside
Haunting lipless mouths a fugue of arcane diatribes
Velvet, their voices coffined Her in slumber
Bespattered and appeased
As pregnant skies outside bore thunder
How sleep the pure
Desire in violent overture
As when high winds
Attune whipped trees
Her savage nature pitched
Would once again conduct the pleas
Of those She loved to agonies
As if it were
The first time every night
That She carved Her seal
In the flesh of life.
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Shouldn't not grave pleasures be my all?
For if I shall see thy Will be done
Grant Me the Witchcraft of thy tongue
Three moondials froze in the shadow of six
As another soul passed to the grasping Styx
Clutching their trinket crucifix
Bats blew from eaves in a dissonant surge
Omens of corruption from within the church
A fetid, dank oasis still clung to fool rebirth
Alone as a stone cold altar
The castle and its keep
Like faerytale dominion rose
A widow to the snow peaks
Wherein reclined the Countess
Limbs purring from the kill
Bathed in virgin white and like the night
Alive and young and unfulfilled
Was it the cry of a wolf
That broke the silver thread of enchanted thoughts?
Of Her life as a mere reflection
As the moon's in narrow windows caught
That opened like dark eyelids on
The sigh of the woods that the wind fell upon
Like a Siren weaving song
From the lilt of choirs choking
Where the vengeful dead
Belong
To the Sorceress and Her charnel arts
She swept from ebon towers at the hour of Mars
beneath a star-inwoven sky latticed by scars
To unbind knotted reins that kept in canter, despair
Shod on melancholy, fleet to sanctuary there,
In netherglades tethered where onyx idols stared
Was it the Kiss of the mist
That peopled the air with the prowess of absinthe?
Lost souls begging resurrection
From Gods upon their forest plinths
Whose epitaphs read of re-ascending to win
Remission from despair through a holocaust of sin
In a tongue hilted in invective rectums
Over signs and seals the sorceress prayed
To Death, to rend the slender veil
That Ancient Ones might rise again
As shadows swelled
The Countess fell
To masturbating with Her dagger
As the Witch gabbled spells
Cumming heavy roses all the way to Hell
As sudden thunder's grue harangue
Announced two pincered worlds
Exuding bane, something came
With the stench of necrophiled graves
To these clandestines
Who shrank from glimpsing horror
That the growls of mating houls inclined
Resplendent
In pendants
Natal trophies torn from bellies of desanctified nuns
A demons, bewinged, bedight
In scum, prowled their circle seeking entry to run
An arctic tongue upon Her vulva
Where rubies smeared to alabaster thighs
Glittered like a contract in the purse of a whore
Receiving sole communion from the body of christ
If blood is what thou carves, foul fiend
I will yield this witch to thee
If thou wouldst draw a veil for Me
O'er lengthening scars of age and grief
As the Demon slavered foetid vows
And bore His prey away
In talons itching to perpetrate
The nausea of eternal rape
The Sorceress screaming in His grasp
Spat a final curse to stain
The Countess with the promise
That Her lord at war would be cruelly slain
And She would rot.
Alone
Insane.
On the twisted nails of faith.
Snuffed tapers sighed
As Death left impressing
His crest of cold tears on the Countess
Benighted like ill-fated Usher
The House of Bathory shrouded
beneath griefs dark facade
If only I could have wept
In mourning by Her side
I would have clasped Her so tight
Like storm-beached Aphrodite
Drowned on Kytherean tides
And Kissed Her
For from Her alone
My lips would have known
Enigmas of shadowy vistas
Where pleasures took flesh
And pain, remorseless
Came freezing the breath
Of raucous life hushed unto whispers
Benighted.
Inhaling the pale waning moonlight that crept
Through the crypt of Her Lord who so lucidly slept
Benighted.
Exhaling the wail of black widowhood's toll
Waxing eternal night entered Her soul
Now haranguing grey skies
With revenge upon life
Gnathic and Sapphic
Needs begged gendercide
Delusions of Grandier denounced the revolt
Of descrying cursed glass, disenchanted in vaults
Encircled by glyphs midst Her sin-sistered cult
With hangman's abandon She plied spiritworlds
To Archangels in bondage
From light to night hurled
Cast down to the earth where torment would unfurl
But soon,
Her tarot proved
Hybrid rumours spread like tumours
Would accrue
And blight Her stars
However scarred
To better bitter truths
Of cold bloodbaths
As bodies rose
In rigid droves
To haunt Her from their
Shallow burials imposed
When wolves exhumed
Their carthen wombs
Where heavy frosts had laboured long
To bare their wounds
To the depths of Her soul they pursued
Wielding their poison they flew
Like a murder of ravens in fugue
And knowing their raptures
Would shatter Her dreams
She clawed blackened books for damnation's reprieve
Baneful cawed canons on amassed enemies
So Hallow's Eve
As She received
Like Bellona to the ball
Those enemies
Fell-sisters heaved
Her torturies
Cross stained flagstones
To Her carriage reined to flee
But She knew She must brave the night through
Though fear crept a deathshead o'er the moon
Like a murder of ravens in Fugue
For each masked, jewelled gaze held dread purpose
Horror froze painted eyes to cold stares
And even Her dance
In the vast mirrors cast
Looked the ill of Her future
If fate feasted there
In an age crucified by the nails of faith
When rank scarecrows of christ blighted lands
An aloof Countess born an obsidian wraith
Dared the abyss knowing well She was damned
Her life whispered grief like a funeral march
Twisted and yearning, obsessed an entranced
With those succumbing to cruelty
Crushed 'neath the gait of Her dance
A whirlwind of fire that swept through the briers
Of sweet rose Her thickets of black thorn had grasped
She demanded the Heavens and forever to glean
The elixir of Youth from the pure
Whilst Her lesbian fantasies
Reamed to extremes
Over decades unleashed
Came for blood's silken cure
But Her reign ended swiftly
For Dark Gods dreamt too deep
To heed Her pleas
When Her gaolers were assailed
With condemnations from a priest
Who'd stammered rites
In the dead of night
For maidens staining winding sheets
And She postured proud
When Her crimes were trowelled
And jezebelled to peasant lips
Though She smelt the fires
That licked limbs higher
To the tortured cunts of accomplices
So ends this twisted fable's worth
And though spared the pyre's bite
By dint of nobled bloodlined birth
Her sins crimes garnered Her no respite
Forever severed from the thrill of coming night
Where slow Death alone could grant Her flight
The Spirits have all but fled judgement
I rot, alone, insane,
Where the forest whispers puce laments for me
From amidst the pine and wreathed wolfsbane
Beyond these walls, wherein condemned
To the gloom of an austere tomb
I pace with feral madness sent
Through the pale beams of a guiltless moon
Who, bereft of necrologies, thus
Commands creation over the earth
Whilst I resign my lips to death
A slow cold kiss that chides rebirth
Though one last wish is bequeathed by fate
My beauty shalt wilt, unseen
Save for twin black eyes that shalt come to take
My soul to peace or Hell for company
My soul to Hell for company
An Archangel in bondage
Bediademed, souled
With a murder of ravens
But no less Astarte to behold
Abandoned by Heaven
To the dead, dark and past
Cast Her dispersions
On life's brittle glass
And though Her eyes still held fire
As stonewalls caged the beast
against the lassitudes of Death
She fought but fell to greet
And midst lies in collusion
She was martyred to teach
That "Divinity and Lust
Are forever forbidden to meet"
But I swore that they would
Before the veil could part our embrace
Twixt Her cold, silent hips I kissed
And promised Christendom in flames
Gravid with madness
Like a feculent dirge
That obsesses the heart
I am covened by words
To avenge Her
Ebon splendour
And surrender
My soul to the dead to achieve
Prophecies of libidinous scourge
Horripilation braying o'er carious herds
Vexing nightmares
And their weak prayers
To a no one there
To hinder Her decree
To weed the world of their disease
As shadows unblind mine eyes to see
The meat that is their congregation
How they plead to the skies
But this is mere foreplay to war
Scar-riddled saffron eves bleed like the conjugal
Vestal daughters giving throat to the priest
A psychophant, the despoiler of faith
Now His skinless crucifixion feeds a winged diocese
For Her interred
I tore a battle banner from His hide
Splashed in red goetia
Hues of Hell and deicide
So came the night
Its obsidian light
Is a master whom disasters
Suck upon like concubines
And under black skirts
That whisper of delight
Darkseeds near fruition
Darked deeds to marry mine
In Death's bed I have lain
Paying lip-service to shame
But for dreaming of thee I regain
A reason to seek life again
Then we smite the divine
For our true nature is sin
To strip tender flesh from these swine
Like the lick of carnivorous winds
The breath of the storm that begins
By forcing its Herod tongue in
The womb of the holy virgin
To taste of immaculate sin
From temptation's peak we will see
The world unfurled at last
Now the wolves of time who stalk Mankind
Shall be as one in grim repast
Commemorating sickle moons
The pack are poised to reap
A scythe of white roses in bloom
Whose twisted thorns will keep
A crown upon a dead man
Daylights crucified in sleep
And lives that hide in scriptured lies
To the memories of a scream
And we shall dance amid the ruin
As Adam and Evil
Dizzy at the falling stars
That burn fiercer in throes of upheaval
If all must we damn for this moment
Then it shall be so
For our souls have crossed oceans of time
To clasp one another more tightly
Than Death could alone
As Zyklon beats reign to make carrion crawl
The talons of lust rake a clarion call
To the lick of carnivorous winds
The lick of carnivorous winds
An Archangel in bondage
Bediademed, souled
With a murder of ravens
But no less Astarte to behold
Abandoned by Heaven
To the dead, dark and past
Cast Her dispersions
On life's brittle glass
And though Her eyes still held fire
As stonewalls caged the beast
against the lassitudes of Death
She fought but fell to greet
And midst lies in collusion
She was martyred to teach
That "Divinity and Lust
Are forever forbidden to meet"
But I swore that they would
Before the veil could part our embrace
Twixt Her cold, silent hips I kissed
And promised Christendom in flames
Gravid with madness
Like a feculent dirge
That obsesses the heart
I am covened by words
To avenge Her
Ebon splendour
And surrender
My soul to the dead to achieve
Prophecies of libidinous scourge
Horripilation braying o'er carious herds
Vexing nightmares
And their weak prayers
To a no one there
To hinder Her decree
To weed the world of their disease
As shadows unblind mine eyes to see
The meat that is their congregation
How they plead to the skies
But this is mere foreplay to war
Scar-riddled saffron eves bleed like the conjugal
Vestal daughters giving throat to the priest
A psychophant, the despoiler of faith
Now His skinless crucifixion feeds a winged diocese
For Her interred
I tore a battle banner from His hide
Splashed in red goetia
Hues of Hell and deicide
So came the night
Its obsidian light
Is a master whom disasters
Suck upon like concubines
And under black skirts
That whisper of delight
Darkseeds near fruition
Darked deeds to marry mine
In Death's bed I have lain
Paying lip-service to shame
But for dreaming of thee I regain
A reason to seek life again

The talons of lust rake a clarion call
To the lick of carnivorous winds
The lick of carnivorous winds
I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life, and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to The Gallow's Pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Motherfuckers!!
Running low!!
When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end not some crazy dream?
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not so easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears they flow but why am I crying?
After all I am not afraid of dying
Don't believe that there never is an end
As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Someone cries from a cell God be with you
If there's a God then why has he let me die?
As I walk all my life drifts before me
Though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul it's willing to fly away
Mark my words believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to see the truth
When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down there is just a strange illusion.
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
No
Behind the scene of destiny
I adore you in this song for me
Call me within your holy house to dwell
Let me raise for myself in spell
Voluptuously dancing daughters of the night sky
Sing the rapturous love song with high
Let your sweet scented juice run
Waste away under the lashes of my whip
Bath in sin
Sadistic Souls
Break their crust
Sodomy and Lust
Carnal desire runs through my veins
Whipping boys and scapegoats cry in pain
Psychopathic terror during their sleep
My power ask why, my power is weak
Spineless bundles of my excess
Expurse of innocence and helplessness
In the perfumes of my secret orison
Fresh blood of children drops down on me
Bath in sin
Sadistic Souls
Break their crust
Sodomy and Lust
Madness, crime, disgrace, ptomaine
Excrements, contempt, violence, kill
Ordeals of thousand deeds congealed in gloom
Strike hard and deep, to hell with 'em master
Mighty prophets stature shall surpass the stars
The passion is the smell of cremation
I spit on your crapulous creed, curse 'em!
Sucking you giveth delight and bright glory
Strive ever to be more joyous to the death
Don't fear any god will deny you for this
Bath in sin
Sadistic Souls
Break their crust
Sodomy and Lust
Two thousand fattened years like maniacs
Have despoiled our common grave
Now what necrophagous Second Coming backs
From the cradle to enslave?
Sickle constellations
Stud the belts that welt the sky
Whilst the bitter winter moon
Prowls the cloud, dead-eyed
Like shifting parent flesh
Under silk matricide
Watchful as she was upon Eden
Where every rose arbour and orchard she swept
Hid the hissing of a serpent Libido
In an ancient tryst with catastrophe
Soon the be kept
Hear that hissing now on the breeze
As through the plundered groves of the carnal garden
A fresh horror blows but ten billion souls
Are blind to see the rotting wood for the trees
This is the theme to a better Armageddon
Nightchords rake the heavens
And what use are prayers to that god?
As devils bay concensus for the space to piss
On your smouldering faith
And the mouldering face
Of this world long a paradise lost
This is the end of everything
Hear the growing chora that a new dawn shall bring
Danse macabre 'neath the tilt of the zodiac
Now brighter stars shall reflect on our fate
What sick nativities will be freed when those lights burn black?
The darkside of the mirror always threw our malice back
I see the serpentine in your eyes
The nature of the beast as revelations arrive
Our screams shall trail to Angels
For those damned in flames repay
All sinners lose their lot on Judgement Day
We should have cut our looses as at Calvary
But our hearts like heavy crosses held the vain belief
Salvation, like a promised nation
Gleamed a claim away
This is the end of everything you have ever known
Buried like vanquished reason
Death is season
Drive like the drifting snow
Peace, a fragile lover, left us fantasising war
On our knees or another f**ker's shore
Heiling new flesh
Read, then roared
To a crooked cross and a Holy Cause
What else be whipped to frenzy for?
This is the end of everything
Rear the tragedies
That the Seraphim shall sing
Old adversaries
Next to Eve
Now they're clawing back
I smell their cumming
As through webbed panes of meat
Led by hoary Death
They never left
Dreaming sodomies
To impress on human failure
When we've bled upon our knees
Tablatures of gravel law
Shall see Gehennah paved
When empires fall
And nightmares crawl
From the cradle to enslave
This is the end of everything
Sister midnight comes blaspheming
Screaming in the keys of faith and fear
Unentwining our spines twists me to kneeling
Spilling like the moonlight on her glistening rear
Defiled at heart
In this perfect hell
Under red leaves bleeding
Over scaled chateau we fell
To demonocracy
Where neither Adam or Eve
Conceived of such iniquities
From pleasure or pain
Or the razor's edge inbetween
Thou art my seventh heaven burning
Going down as with the sun
Within like a river fluids moves a torrent
Bound to please
On denierred knees
In any wicked way
That her whims may warrant
I hang on every verb
Every dirty word
Interred
In her pornoglossa
Christlike, whipped and weak
Painted nails driven through the meek
Yet in obituary
My dreams still weep
Of dark blood and fucking thee
Thou art seventh heaven burning
Going down as with the day
Baring lunar curvature
Like canvas for a lick of pain
Writhing like a viper
Deep inside her Eden
Forbidden to eat
I kiss leylines to her feet
Then baiting wrath
I steal a path
Back to the fruits of her womb
Back to the crack of her tomb
Her roseate sliver
Quivers with snuff appeal
The torque of her hips
Lip-sync me in for the kill
Tongue-tied, tightrope and spread like disease
I drain the cup of this Miss Sire
Her water into wine for me
Thou art my seventh angel squirming
'Neath the forked tongue of the beast
Arching toward the fabled
Like a sculptured nymph seeking base relief
Whilst the world outside
A wood of suicide
Would die for this release
Our slow orgasmic fuses greet
By night and by candle
At each other's throat
In a slick drift of red
Setting god's teeth on edge
We were as wolves preying inside the fold
Of a slaughtered lamb throw
On a four poster bed
Succulent, Succubus
Laid without rest
In the dead of the night
Succulent, Succubus
In thy arms
And thy wetness
On glossed lips I taste
Conspiracies, secrecies, sorceries laced
With thick unguent rum
Black-rayed suns and Autumn
Always in season for our nightfall from grace
Gorge upon my seed
Starved Persephone
Succulent, Succubus
Succour me.
That I might keep
Thee with me in Hades
Succulent, Succubus
Succour me
Turn the lights down low
And close the door, oh
Future is coming
Future risin'
Shotgun blast, a demon piece of lead
With both eyes open
I wait up for the kill
Feel the evil
Feel the heat as I blast you open
Death comes ripping
And it's going, death comes ripping
You feel the heat as death comes ripping
Rip your back out
And death comes ripping out
Flesh and blood
To weak for you
Turnin' it over
A little too late to penetrate
Death comes ripping
And it's going death comes ripping
You feel the heat as death comes ripping
It'll rip your back out
Death comes ripping
And it's going, death comes ripping
You feel the heat as death comes ripping
You rip your back out
Death comes ripping
And it goes, death comes ripping out
And I often sigh
I often wonder why
I'm still here and I still cry
And I often cry
I often spill a tear
Over those not here
But still they are so near
Please ease my burden
And I still remember
A memory and I weep
In my broken sleep
The scars they cut so deep
Please ease my burden
Please ease my pain
Surely without war there would be no loss
Hence no mourning, no grief, no pain, no misery
No sleepless nights missing the dead 
Oh, no more
No more war
Candelabra snuffed prey-silhouette wedded
Nightfall take my hand
Seduce me with silky timbred limbs
Grant me thy dark command
Over the peaks framing tapestries
Of thick forest, dusk has filled
With Lucifugous kisses enwreathed in mist
Creeping like violations from the shadows to kill
Lucretia
is my love in vein
When thy tears bleed sweeter
Thank the midsummer rain?
Bewinged, infested belfries
Toll o'er the sobbing throng
A writhe of lethargic, terrored nudes
Whipped and welted neath the barbed windsong
in saddean paradise
Ancestral legacies linger on
I am He
The crowned and conquering darkness
Satan robed in ecumenical filth
Livid Bacchus sustained by bridal echelons of sylph
This wintry eve when the snow glistens deep
And sharpened turrets wed the jewelless skies
I shrug off the shroud of preternatural sleep
Enbroided by these words Malaresia scribed
Beauty slept and angels wept
For Her immortal soul
In this response, all evil chose
To claim her for their very own
Carpathia
The pleasured dead speak of her
In necromantic tongue
When ambered daylights are done
Masterbating in their graves
On her zenith to come
This catafalque night when awed stars report
Their absence from the heavenly brow
Crippled seraph shalt cower in illustrious courts
Whilsts the cloaked maelstrom resounds throughout
How the storm it fulfills
My heart though unhealed
Celestial knifes ebonied
And wild woods thrill
Yet far fiercer still
Her lustre eviscerates me
Carpathia
Priapic lovers twist in concert with Her
Covenants are struck, jagged lightning fellates
The path towards the castle weary innocence takes
I rule as Master here
Where feral hordes impart my temper
Love sank wounded when I, betrayed
saw death etch cruelly, upon my lineage
Usher the spite seething Draconist
And commit this world to thy ancient
sovereignty
Erunescent veil descend
Psalmed sunset thus portends
And laid to rest, I now am blessed
With this darkness
Forever more
Supreme Vampiric Evil
Winter ice
Terminal frost
Closing eyes of the equinox
Dimensional change
darkening skies
The sphere is shackled till dusk
Prophet dreams
ride the winds
As black holes open for devouring
Universal chaos in the realm of time
Surface of earth
covered in rime
From beyond enter the horror
Of a dark and hideous nature
The fall of man is now at hand
Awakened from an ancient slumber
The immortal ones return
The earth is theirs once again
Stricken, cursed
frozen damnation
Man's fall to perpetual domination
Time trapped in between changes
Frigid return to the chamber of ages
Cthulhu dawn
Spatter the stars
Douse their luminosity
With our amniotic retch
Promulgating the birth
Of another Hell on Earth
Shadows gather poisoned henna for the flesh
A necrotic cattle brand
The hissing downfall pentagram
Carven deep upon the church doors of the damned
But no Passover is planned
A great renewal growls at hand
And only when they're running
Will they come to understand
So ends the pitiful reign of Man
When the moon exhales
Behind a veil
Of widowhood and clouds
On a Biblical scale
We raise the stakes
To silhouette the impaled
Crowds
Within this kissed disembowel arena
A broken seal on an ancient curse
Unleashes beasts from the seismic breach
With lightning reach and genocidal thirst
Mountains of archaos theories
In collision as at planetary dawn
Apocalypse's razorbacks
Beat wings on glass as thunder cracks
Unfurled across a world hurled to the black
Cthulhu dawn
Shatter the glass house
Wherein spirits breathe out
Halitosis of the soul
From a recking abscess
Plague of far righteousness
All fates hang in the balance
Mocking crucified dolls
An inquisition outs
When the Sun goes out our powers
Will extend throughout Heaven like Asphodel
As they have for countless lustrum
In dark Midian accustoned
To burning effigies of our enemies well
So begins the sibilant world Death knell
When a corpse wind howls
And awakes from drowse
The scheming dead freed
Of gossamer shrouds
We gorgonise eyes
Of the storm aroused
Red
Blinding time
All lines dine on this instance
A melting spool of beggar, negative frames
The skies teem alive, to watch die
Mankind hauled to fable in vast tenement graves
Cthulhu dawn
Through arcades where shimmering snowfall
Lay in state with the sad and damned
A rent lament barely flung above a whisper
Drew Me like a ghost to the haunts of Man
I Found Her tempting fate between Her wrist and razor
A kindred spirit in a graveyard
Beneath the stature of a colder saviour
Mist hung like thieves wreathed in scant arabesques
And through the chill earth it bedwed Her drawling breast
Like a come dream true under etched glass spent
Making love to the beautiful dead
She has sinned and severed Heaven
And in its vulgar sight
Two figures writhe, but one silhouette
Extends its fingers to the light
Gothic towers tottered on my heels
As I fled asylum grounds
Committing hard crimes to soft cells
Where now another's screams resound.
From the gaspings in Her passing
Six feet under or beneath frayed gown
When Her hands pointed to midnight
In a white stained chamber bound
I Swept Her from the abyss of another dementia
Freeing Her soul from the fetters of fate
To take the reins of pleasure
Now nightwane mirrors freeze in seizure
At the glimpse of charmed pins in Her thighs
Ballrooms filled with black cats scratch
Out of spite and playful eyes
Pricked as a Witch Her stitches itch
For familiar lips to lick them dry
Whilst the dark regrasps, for if She asks
The Sun forsakes the rite to rise
And is the first to discern, that this Angel's return
Is a vengeful call on grace
For even martyrdom backs from its suicide pacts
A leap of twisted fate betrayed
The scars will last until the stars
Caught in Her train bewitched
Fall into line and yield the sign
That Dawn in born to their eclipse
For Our Inhumankind
Comes an underdog day Sunrise
Rippling with fire like femaledition
Wind amidst the flame
I gazed out
Tapped into the fog and shared her pain
When in her mind she sought his leave
And begged forgiveness
I splintered Her coffin and lay on the floor
Of a vault with Her clasped as the moon hugs the shore
What treachery this that She breathed no more?
Christ you bastard!
I wished Her back but the dead adored Her
Even wild winds sang in chora for Her
Saffron from my heart, from the start I swore
We'd be together more
Creation froze with the triumph of Death
But still She stirred and awoke bereft
Of concern save for the aeons left
To lead the darkness
She schemes of growing power and the lengths sucked hard to get it
I dream of being God but ever living to regret it
Our fecund nature decrees that Jesus wept come for
The Devil on Her knees
To grant Her lows a remedy
And mine desire's wish
To taste thereof of Heaven's scent
As sick and twisted as it is
For Her corset laced with arsenic
Hides snake curves within Her midst
Whilst Her halo of white lies supplies
Her temple to what God forbids.
Come distortured artists
Bitter things seek meaning
Even if they're madness to behold
Once forbears to horizons
Where the dead stayed dreaming
Now nightmares waken souls
That fear the living's toll
Three times moonwise stain thy graves
For words alone are at loss to trace
The face of today's inhuman wraith
One half adrift in the vast abyss
Of despair and misery
The other a mask of rich red lips
Whetted by the fevers of belief and greed
All damned in this inferno
Where even Virgil averts His eyes
From the black mass mutual gang rape
Of Caesing hands an forced divides
Trespass these seven gates
To a world bloodlet to shades
Where Seraphim
Falling on deaf ears bleat
Of their cold and coming Master's race
In the seweres of Babylon
Stillborn to a trough anon
Chimiracles will hatch like plots
To dredge faces to pearl their cross
Five Aeons past, yet still Man grasps
At final straws to save his cast
His Lord is a leper we shall not want
He betrayed us with white lies
His acrid pall as of the tomb
Reminds us how we rot inside
Gutted like fool's paradise
Glutted on cruel appetites
Holding court to chaos
Folding to far graver arms
A downfall fatal to all resounds
As orgies peak in self centred psalms
And Nature screams Her sufferings
Under bowed and cankered wings
A bleak scorched Earth necrotica burning
Like the robes we've torn from Her
She begs Us lay Her pain to rest
Lest We are left with nothingness
Save for Her stripped and ravished flesh
And if Her fate is not portent of Apocalypse
Then the comets that graze night skies
Will surely cleanse of wrongs and reichs
When you and I and all else dies...
It's rotting down
Interdependent as worms to the grave
Allah's true name is naught
Chist acannot save
Locked in a waltz of evermore frantic steps
Spells of regret
Death Magick for Adepts
Be prepared to fulfill prophecies
The glorious fall of a sin dynasty
Gutted like fool's paradise
Glutted on cruel appeitites
We've woven hearts a thorn arbour
Left tear streaked reason upon the shore
And bereft of compass, star or more
Set out for this World's end
Few at the prow, most slave below
Painting coal a perfect gold
But for all it's worth, the engines slow
Dead in the brine again
Come cabin fever, sodomy on the bounty
Prey to phallus seas
That hiss and foam to douse disease
A storm roars on the way
Blacker than the Ace of Rapes
Dealt out by Death in darkwood glades
Our Ship of Fools, all boards handmade
Sinks, dashed by seismic waves
I was born with a birthmark of cinders
Debris cast from the stars and Mother
A ring of bright slaughter, I spat in the waters
Of life that ran slick from the stabwounds in Her
Dub Me Lord Abortion, the living dead
The bonesaw on the backseat
On this bitter night of giving head
A sharp rear entry, an exit in red
Lump in the throat, on my come choke
The killing joke worn thin with breath
I grew up on the sluts bastard Father beat blue
Keepsake cunts cut full out easing puberty through
Aah! Nostalgia grows
Now times nine or ten
Within this vice den called a soul
Dying resurrection
I dig deep to come again
The spasm of orgasm on a roll
I live the slow serrated rape
The bucks fizz of amyl nitrate
Victims force fed their own face
Tear stains upon the drape
I should compare them
To a warm Summer's day
But to the letter, it is better
To lichen their names to a grave
Counting My years on an abacus strung
With labial rings and heartstrings undone
Dub Me Lord Abortion, the living dead
The bonesaw on the backseat
On this bitter night of giving head
A sharp rear entry, an exit in red
Lump in the throat, on My come choke
The killing joke worn thin with breath
Horrorscopes My diorama
A twelve part so far psychodrama
Another chained I mean to harm Her
Inside as well as out
A perverts gasp inside the mask
I'm hard, blow My house of cards
All turn up Death, Her bleeding starts
In brute vermilion parts
Now I slither through the hairline cracks
In sanity, best watch your back
Possessed with levering Hell's gates wide
Liberating knives to cut Humanity slack
My ambition is to slay anon
A sinner in the hands of a dirty God
Who lets Me prey, a Gilles De Rais
Of light where faith leads truth astray
I slit guts guts and free the moistest faces
Corrupt the corpse and seize the choicest pieces
Her alabaster limbs that dim the lit carnal grin
Vaginal skin to later taste and masturbate within
My heart was a wardrum beat
By jugular cults in eerie jungle vaults
When number thirteen fell in My lap
Lips and skin like sin, a Venus Mantrap
My appetite whetted, storm crows wheeled
At the blurred edges or reason 'til I was fulfilled
Whors d'oeuvres eaten, I tucked Her into
A grave coffin fit for the Queen of Spades
She went out like the light in My mind
Her face an avalanche of pearl, of ruby wine
Much was a flux, but the mouth once good for fucks
Came from retirement to prove She had not lost Her touch
I kissed Her viciously, maliciously, religiously
But when has ONE been able TO best separate the THREE?
I know I'm sick as Dahmer did, but this is what I do
Aah, aah, ahh, I'll let you sleep when I am through
You Fucking Whore!
The suspect shadow sher they least
Expect My burning grasp to reach
The stranglehold, the opened arms
Seeking sweet meat with no holes barred
Rainbows that My razors wrung
Midst Her screams and seams undone
Sung at the top of punctured lungs
I bite My spiteful tongue
Lest curses spat from primal lairs
Freeze romance where Angels, bare
Are lost to love, bloodloss, despair
I weep, they merely stare...
And stare, and stare, and stare, and stare.
Her bouquets are wilted
Too long has She slept
Their cruel red mouths darkened
To bowed silhouettes
I saw in a new moon
With Her scent on my breath
But then all to soon
Came the hunger for flesh
I held Her in eyes like necropoli
Laying Her on a tomb with a view
Lighting Her from Her feet
To the stars in Her hair
Drove sweet blood to Her throat
And My lips parted there
In the tone of splintered bone
She screams benighted
My limbs ignite
A carnal carnivore
On all fours to go
From torture gardens of Dis
Having never breathed an Eve
As far narcotic as this
Two spellbound hellhounds
Hearts pounding loud
Racing Heaven out of focus
Under quicksilver clouds
God is maimed come let us prey
To lunar deities that pave deadways
Twixt the living and the grave
To cast our feral shadows there
We made Love bleed on a Deathbed shared
Where, begging Me to feed
To best be Were
I licked Her wounds and ate Her rare
Argentinum spurred
Her wanton words incurred
A sin ridden tongue
To open trading in fur
Never were those gates of pearl
So rubbed to their cusp
Never were the Worlds above
So bitten with the bestial
Seraphim fell like guillotines
Giving gracious head
Instead of harking prophecies
And how our brother sang
In the thick evergreens
Theirs was a chorus for raucous souls
Shifting shape and lifting napes
To commemorate
Erotic stains
Unfasten thy masque
Come sky-clad to my arms
Leave thy gown a dark pool at thy feet
I yearn musky valleys that no Man hath seen
The chill keen of stars
Over Yew and deep wooded ravines
A hidden meridian
Where Midian may be
In black antlered glades
Encunted in this forest Goddess
She whispers My name
I buck under flames
Animal nitrates
Howling through my veins
I ride riptides that wrest and writhe to the fore
New lusts eclipsing lips
That brought me to this verge of War
With inner beasts unleashed
To feast, fuck and run
Rampart in chase of She wolf pacts
Forged on heat with setting Suns
I love the night
It would murder My soul
Should I ever fall blind
For though thy flesh haunts
I keep also in mind
The stampede of clouds
From Dusk's predatory sky
Purple versed like the funeral hearse
That first turned thee over to My
Unbridled kiss when I found thee in mist
Dressed for the sepulchre
My Demon bride
God is maimed come let Us prey
To Lunar Deities that pave deadways
Twixt the living and the grave
Ours was a chorus for raucous souls
Shifting shape and lifting nape
To commemorate
Erotic stains
The Moon, she hangs like a cruel portrait
Soft winds whisper the bidding of trees
As this tragedy starts with a shattered glass heart
And the Midnightmare trampling of dreams
But oh, no tears please
Fear and pain may accompany Death
But it is desire that shepherds it's certainty
As We shall see
She was divinity's creature
That kissed the cold mirrors
A Queen of Snows
Far beyond compare
Lips attuned to symmetry
Sought Her everywhere
Dark liqoured eyes
An Arabian nightmare
She shone on watercolours
Of my pondlife as pearl
Until those who couldn't have Her
Cut Her free of this World
That fateful Eve when
The trees stank of sunset and camphor
Their lanterns chased phantoms and threw
An inquisitive glance, like the shadows they cast
On my love picking rue by the light of the moon
Putting reason to flight
Or to death as their way
They crept through woods mesmerized
By the taffeta Ley
Of Her hips that held sway
Over all they surveyed
Save a mist on the rise
A deadly blessing to hide
Her ghost in the fog
They raped left
Five men of God
Her ghost in the fog
Dawn discovered Her there
Beneath the Cedar's stare
Silk dress torn, Her raven hair
Flown to gown Her beauty bared
Was starred with frost, I knew Her lost
I wept 'til tears crept back to prayer
She'd sworn Me vows in fragrant blood
Never to part
Lest jealous Heaven stole our hearts
Then this I screamed:
Come back to Me for
I was born in love with thee
So why should fate stand in between?
And as I drowned Her gentle curves
With dreams unsaid and final words
I espied a gleam trodden to earth
The Church bell tower key
The village mourned her by the by
For She'd been a witch
Their Men had longed to try
And I broke under Christ seeking guilty signs
My tortured soul on ice
A Queen of snow
Far beyond compare
Lips attuned to symmetry
Sought Her everywhere
Trappistine eyes
An Arabian nightmare
She was Ersulie possessed
Of a milky white skin
My porcelain Yin
A graceful Angel of Sin
And so for Her
The breeze stank of sunset and camphor
My lantern chased Her phantom and blew
Their Chapel ablaze and all locked in to a pain
Best reserved for judgement that their bible construed
Putting reason to flight
Or to flame unashamed
I swept form cries
Mesmerized
By the taffeta Ley
Or Her hips that held sway
Over all those at bay
Save a mist on the rise
A final blessing to hide
Her ghost in the fog
And I embraced
Where lovers rot
Her ghost in the fog
Her ghost in the fog
Archangel, Dark Angel
Lend me thy light
Through Death's veil
'Til we have Heaven in sight!
Biblical choirs soar beyond veiled light
A swan song for ravens trapped flapping in night
A tragic yet magical fall from grace
Too awful to taste for the led and the chaste
Those whose long fetters are addressed to all saints
Free shining souls torn from God's given Reich
Defiled, reviled, exiled from sight
And Hell knows we sought victory
Chancing the leash
But when bad die were cast
We were cast down to die
A steeple of needles thrust into our eyes
So scholars might say we were blinded by pride
Like the sin of Our Father and the whims of our kind
Whom in Isaiah and Midian thrived
Regaining His sights for the storming of skies
And after descenturies have crawled, vilified
Our dark harkened day on spread wing now arrives
For eternity is a coprophagic
Backward figure head
Gorging on Her own bitter end
And We have eaten shit
Until we're close to addicts
Now grime is running out
For us to make amends
To retake what once was lost
To exalt our throne above the stars of God
To throw our fuck into gates and guts
Of a severed never land
Where we, the damned
Once pleasured ran
Like seamen from the phallus sea
Atrocious oceans must be crossed
To exalt our throne above the stars of God
The thirteenth sign of the Zodiac climbs
Cowled and scythed to snuff the sunrise
Throwing shades of war before like prophecy
Night breed freed from the vasty deep
Nasty reap of freaks forsaken
And when sultry Dusk disrobes they'll learn
She is not a natural blond
For the lower She goes the darker it grows
An Eve that blows on Her knees for Satan
Fellated Satan
Screams congeal in clotted pearl
As He unfurls from aching hibernation
Stormbringer drums thunder to full Dis orchestra
As lighting streaks with fire
Black clouds that shroud the Earth
Whose cold breasts have held us in scar pillories
But now the Sun is loath to come
The crescent moon is freed
Elated Satan
The scimitar slash to the under gash
Of Heaven too slight for penetration
We strike as wolves from the thickening fog
To exalt our throne over the stars of God
Lowly holy goats bare the brunt
Of rabid dogmas on a stellar bearhunt
Bastioned in citadels and monastic cells
That smell of blessed cunt
Like a convent where crosses rust
From thirty dirty habits of shaved nun
There where deeper needs are begged of lust
And cess and less impress enough
Obtaining the ord of Our Guardian, Anger
And Death's tunnel vision
Bad thing in collision
The locking of eyes and jagged antler
Unpicking the seams of fate sewn over dreams
Feasting from throats of celestial thieves
And God knows we seek victory
Now that we are unleashed
To drive nails home of blind faith through those
Who drove us from error to terror below
Refugees clung to a crown furred in flies
Tarred with red honey, the plaster
Of many a spire that aspired to rise
Seeking Messiahs that by us soon die
In the start like a cast
In morality plays
Our hearts wore a mask
Of dead rooks in the rain
The World was our cloister
No prayer, bent in shame
Our once lucent plumage
Stung with horn withered grey
And away
As Aeons slew so we grew to myth
Revenge accrued to a monolith
Bursting through from our roofed abyss
Like an aether greased fist
Now vulvite gates are so sorely missed
Our horror pours through the orifice
Where once the spheres and archangels kissed
Fellated Satan
His coming assails
The Night In Gales
That bewail turned tides
That engulf their nation
Now divinity is a worm ridden mouth
In a darkened high house
Overrun by disease
So let the truth be wrung
That the Banished Ones intent
On reinstatement have won
We breathe by virtue of their rot
Now our souls exult above the stars of God
Oh, sweet Midian,
I burn for thee at heart.
Don't despair me.
Come bare me on wings of graveyard robbed leather
To where pleasure rings deep secrets
In spurts, after dark...
Under full moons waxing lyrically:
Death's poetry floods the soul,
Like the freezing seed of a demon freed
To curse the stars with vertigo.
And in their dance, in trance I've prised wide
Slick rifts twixt obsidian thighs,
Hymeneal gates to darker sides.
A glimpse of plinths where Midian lies.
Haunted by this portent,
This obsession in my mind.
With a city sunk below,
Tall cedar groves and graves sublime
Sporting their importance,
Marble wings spread to the skies.
A vale of dreams that it would seem,
The daylights race to leave behind.
These visions struck like a furious fuck
Nailing wet lips to cold cemetery walls.
Flashes of lust to dust
Splashed across my psychic pall,
As hybrid lovers reached their cusp
With final thrusts I saw it all.
Forbidden Midian,
A long fabled Judecca.
A sanctuary for sin...
You rival Heaven
Above Heaven's tragic wreck
Though the only Angels in repose
Were those with ivy strangled necks
Small mercies in vistas of dolmen and vault.
Gaunt, haunched edifices
Midst lightfingered mists,
From whence more awful shadows
Drew back rusted bolts
And dared a threshold.
The searing Sun had knelt to kiss.
Shades of dusk, cruelty and myth,
The Tribes of Christ will not forgive -
And shall not suffer their kind to live!
For I, mesmerized, started not from tombs,
Or their waltz so sibilant
Through the gathering gloom!
But from flumes of the moon in bloom,
Baring each a face effaced,
And raped in the womb!
In hidden Midian,
A Vatican lying in state,
For the sanctity of sin...
To rival Heaven
Free of Heaven's tragic wreck
Though the only Angels that arose
Were those who fell to most requests
Small mercies in vistas where dolmen and vault
Caught twisted whispers where fisted sisters
Haunched, flaunted orifice
Midst lighter fingered mists.
Whilst I watched without revolt,
Carnalities few beasts permit.
Between the dog and wolf,
Bared fangs met in intercourse.
A nightly rite of teeth and cunt,
For those below who rose to hunt.
Soar sights that preyed on Me for days,
And in laudenum's haze
I painted them all
The slew of sith and kin
I drew in blood, my veins in thrall
To Deathugees at peace within
Grotesques and wolves in women's skins
The raven winged and missing limb
Suicides and split thighed Seraphim.
And marble stairs
Stargrazers dare
Ascend like prayer
As smoke or ghost or lithe nightmares
Under full moons waxing lyrically:
Death's poetry floods the soul,
Like the freezing seed of a demon freed
To curse the star with vertigo.
And in their dance, in trance I've prised wide
Slick rifts twixt obsidian thighs,
Hymeneal gates to other sides.
A labyrinth wherein Midian hides
I know I've seen
Through the black backed mirrors in sanity:
Lucent prides amassed in last retreat,
Prurient souls but no more freaks
Than those leashing dreams at harm's length from Me.
And just like grim ascension prophecies,
My revenge, carved deep, will be
A grisly plot that reads,
Like my filthy white ward spattered with their screams.
When My Deviliverers come from fog for Me
Please come for me
Exhuming the moon,
Through the bars in My room.
The sooner the bitter pills swallowed are through.
But no Genotypes, Aphrodites, Demon archetypes,
No Cenobites rise to clame me from you!
No! No! No!
Don't leave here in this storm weathered cell!
No! No! No!
With prophets and losses,
And dead men from crosses,
My fate is a preview of derelict Hell!
Our tongues they could not silence with their malicious lies,
Their unforgotten violence, remember those who died.
And as my flesh is put to fire I hear their voices still,
Their unjust accusations demanding I am killed.
We shall show no mercy to heathen such as thee,
Who stand accused and have refused the Church's clemency,
Your wicked acts are endless through the crimes we cannot name,
Innocent or guilty proved, we'll burn you just the same.
Burning, into the fire.
Burning, a funeral pyre.
Burning, into the fire.
Burning, a funeral pyre.
This self-righteous inquisition is a plague upon our land,
As false as the confessions they force from shattered hands.
We shall show no mercy to heathen such as thee,
Who stand accused and have refused the Church's clemency,
Your wicked acts are endless through the crimes we cannot name,
Innocent or guilty proved, we'll burn you just the same.
Burning, into the fire.
Burning, a funeral pyre.
Burning, into the fire.
Burning, a funeral pyre.
Abused my broken body is cleansed by righteous flame,
Their God a 'God of Mercy' yet in whose name I slain.
My innocence the victim of their superstitious fears,
Religious persecution for the past three hundred years.
Preaching peace and mercy 'neath the shadow of the knife,
A papal reign of terror, slaughter in the name of Christ.
And as my flesh is put to fire I hear their voices still,
Their unjust accusations demanding I am killed.
We shall show no mercy to heathen such as thee,
Who stand accused and have refused the Church's clemency,
Your wicked acts are endless through the crimes we cannot name,
Innocent or guilty proved, we'll burn you just the same.
Burning, into the fire.
Burning, a funeral pyre.
Burning, into the fire.
Burning, a funeral pyre.
A thousand nights once succoured Me
In the shadow of misanthropy
Sat gargoyle-limbed amid My licking flame
A cruel tongue at work in Her secret vaults
Sent Rebellion's embers into revolt
The coming of extinction
Synched to whimpers of my name
Legion I arose, a flood of inhumanity
An acid reign to purify the world
The Asp at Pharaoh's breast
The Atom split under duress
A sniper at the gates of spattered pearl
My heart, torn apart, left a rifled grave
Save for an unfurled flag of hate
To enthral a mindless zombie race
All heil, all heil, all heil the serpentine's gift
All heil, love fails, all hope lies in eclipse
Black bibles I inscribed,
The words Damnation through design
Seemed a bitter truth far better for the lie
For as hope was felled by reason
Forlorn conquers with the season
And Death was swift to swallow on the hells of life
Lowered souls, growing cold, tentered easy prey
When heaven's flock, a fair game, dropped
I bored of war with God with greater thrones to claim...
All heil, all heil, all heil the Libertine's wish
All heil, love fails, all hope lies in eclipse
Then between the past and the ravening dark
A sly Messiah came
In the thick of treaty with obligatory greed
She stole the soul hate had sold away
An ancient chill blew down the centuries
That night atonement's eyes
Lit a burning man in Me
When love lay bleeding
And Fates sate feeding
From wounds gored 'neath
Those cherubic wings
She of kindred light
Gladly sacrificed
Eternity
Just to be
With Me
As the moon whose silvered fingers play
On words and dreams too cursed for day
She led my hand to lands I'd not accrued
Where the Faun Dawn bathed Her golden hair
And faith renewed, leaped joyous there
I praised their worth, then planned their conquest too...
All heil, all heil, all heil the serpentine's gift
All heil, love fails, all hope lies in eclipse
All heil, all heil, all heil the Libertine's wish
All heil, love fails, all hope lies in eclipse
and ignorance is truly bliss.
Sibilant and macabre
Walpurgis sauntered in
Skies litten with five-pointed stars
The work of crafts surpassing sin
As She graced Her window ledge
An orphaned gypsy nymph
This issue of the forest's bed
Skin flushed with sipped absinthe -
Her eyes revealed, as Brocken's peak
Tried once concealing Hell
A snow white line of divine freaks
In riot, where they fell...
The circus lurches in, a ring of promised delight
For seven days and seven festival nights
What wicked wonders lie within the confines
Of the panther's den
She watches from a maypole, on the rip of Her tongue
The restless spirit of Christmas to come
A Gretel sick of merely sucking Her thumb
Than gingerbread men
Spawned scorned, abhorred by the aerial
She was the light of the world going down
War-torn, forlorn and malarial
She was found
Born in a burial gown
Unloosed, the chain of Her god-given cross
Seduced, now pagan ribbons swathe Her repose
In a carnival of souls sold and similarly lost
Too many decades misfit and mislaid
In innocence, a tender legend of prey
Parades Her second coming, now they're running afraid
Spawned scorned, abhorred by the aerial
She was the light of the world going down
War-torn, forlorn and malarial
She was found
Born in a burial gown
Now She moves with a predator's guile
Beyond the fire-lit circle of life
She soothes your cold heart for a while
Then matches its beat, synching in with a knife
She wrestles Her dreams with a delicate case
Espied by Her cross on the wall
And should She awake, through embrace or mistake
She would take Jesus
Bless foot forward and all...
Sibilant and at last
The circus crawled away
With another lover in its arms
Dancing on Her grave...
Through acrid clouds of summer flies
The garden swells with a thousand more wise
Forever flung to celestial dreams
Clawing at the grave of the dead Nazarene
I watch the storm approaching
The darkness calls my name
The trees are growing restless
They feel the season change
Their fruit has putrified
Forbidden once and bound to die
The thread of life lies severed
On the brink of paradise
Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Dash towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch her veil
Reclamation, our time has come...
Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last...
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies
They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?
Will they know of majesty
Of secrets held in dream-dead sleep
And frozen stars that gild the forest floor?
Will their "god" of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from Chaos roused for war?
Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end
We are what we are, what we shall be, again...
Appear; draped in terror
To the comfort of your kin
Stain the milky sunset red
And let the others in...
Summer's dying...
It's just a feeling
I get sometimes
A feeling
Sometimes
And I get frightened
Just like you
I get frightened too
But it's...
No time for heartache
No time to run and hide
No time for breaking down
No time to cry
Sometimes in the world as is you've
Got to shake the hand that feeds you
It's just like Adam says
It's not so hard to understand
It's just like always coming down on
Just like Jesus never came and
What did you expect to find
It's just like always here again it's...
Everything will be alright
Everything will turn out fine
Some nights I still can't sleep
And the voices pass with time
And I keep
No time for tears
No time to run and hide
No time to be afraid of fear
I keep no time to cry
From the primeval mass
Let precious chaos vent
Sacred flesh drenched in fornication
Beloved by Set
May the winds gather her together
From the secrets of men
After thousands of years of terrifying silence
She comes again
All Destroyer
The abolition of the yeshua begins...
Shattered are the icons of the worthless
The Goddess scorned is a Valkyrie born
Scattered are the wings of the virulent holy
Leave their husks to be the prey of vultures and dogs
World without end
Cherish the lissome wants of pernicious evil
Dusk in her eyes
Torn bloody weeping skies
Darkness will hasten to devour
And the weak will flee or die
Heil Bast, drinker of blood, dancer on flames, disposer of light, lover of darkness.
She's holding an inquisition from the bandaged, feeble one.
I slay the lamb in the fervour of thine
Abandonment unto Our Lady
With a quenchless thirst for the infinite
For Her that exists beyond all knowledge
Storming from tired centuries
Under the glare of a waxing death-moon
Terrible beauty of love severed
Rip the baby from the virginal womb
The blood of Jesus
Is the wine of the dead
And the drunken angels
Bleed with incest
The Liliot suckle on Her fruitful breasts
And yield the swords that sever and stain
There will be no act or passion wrought
That shall not be attributed to Her names
To the name of Baphomet...
I yearn to thee who art darkness in thy rising
I pace, alone
In a place for the dead
Overcome by woe
And here, I've grown
So fond of dread
That I swear it's heaven
Oh sweet Mary,
Dressed in grief
Roll back the stone
With these words scrawled in a severed hand
Tears fall like shards of glass that band
In rivers, like sinners
Swept with me to join the damned
A darkened sky
The day that laughter died
Fell swiftly into night
And stayed within Her sight
Staring at the knife
Oh God, how easy now the sacrifice
My life, to have Her with me
So farewell to distant thunder
Those inept stars I've worshipped under
Fall father, their Father
Lies in wait in flames below
Whilst my love, a blood red flower
Calls to me from verdant bowers
Graveside, I cry
Please save me from this Hell I know
A darkened sky
The day that laughter died
Fell swiftly into night
And stayed within Her sight
Staring at the knife
Oh God, how easy now to sacrifice
My life, to have Her with me
An eye for an eye as espied in the bible
My faith is lost to the burning of idols
One less cross to press upon the survival
Of this lorded agony
And I, much as I have tried
To bury Her from mind,
Fate's tourniquet was tied, when She died...
Still sense Her presence so divine
Lithe arms about my throat
Like pining swans entwined
Footfalls at nightfall close to mine
Suicide is a tried and tested formula for release
I snatch Her whisper like the wind through cedars
See Her face in every natural feature
Midst the mist and sleepy hollows of fever...
With glee deceiving me
Suicide is a tried and tested formula for release
I hear Her voice from where the grave defies Her
Siren song to sing along, no finer
Suicide notes, harmonised in a minor
Strike a chord with misery
No light nor reef
No unsinkable of romance keeps me
Safely from the stormy seas
Now drowning, resounding
Death-knells pound my dreams
Unthinkable to dredge through this
Listless and lonely winter frieze
A darken sky
This day hereafter dies
Falls swiftly into night
And stays within my sight
Staring at the knife
Oh God, how ease it was to sacrifice
My life, to have Her with me
No more a victim of a crusade
Where souls are strung from a moral palisade
I slit my wrists and quickly slip away...
I journey now on jewelled sands
Beneath a moon to Summerlands
To grace Her lips with contraband
The blaze once in my veins
Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.
Thee I invoke, a bornless one
All woman, pure predator
Wherein conspiracies and impulse dwell
Like a seething fall from grace
Thee I worship...
Thou art darkest Gabrielle
Lilith rode the steed
Thou art pale Hecate
Rising from Thessaly
Crush their unworthy idols
No church shall bar our path
Seductive Evil, drink your fill
Of the bleeding Christ in your arms
Thou art in my dreams
The darkness in my eyes
The rapture in their screams
Black goddess
We bide our hideous soldiers
Inviting esctacy
But though they send the thunder
Bringing their dekind
Thou art in my dreams
The darkness in my eyes
The rapture in their screams
Black goddess
Nothing will keep us apart
We could kill them all
If desire tore free
Our union is one sweet sinful Eve
And the night draws in beside her
As we embrace the dark with designs
And I pour my soul to those eyes of fire
As I bury my seed deep inside
Archangel, snare the flesh
Suck dry the ebbing wound
Leave them lifeless and broken
My beloved...
Oh, how I have craved for you
You so pure and other-worldly with your scent of winter
Am I to bleed myself dry just to see your delight?
And the fear retreats forever
When my secrets are wedded with thine
Under seven stars we came together
To plot the new age's decline
Ishtar my Queen
Come forth to me
And help me seize
My future from the House of Death
That in the release of immortality
I should slay their fucking Nazarene
Ah... the lies... the kiss... I kill for you
Thou art in my dreams
The darkness in my eyes
The rapture in their screams
Black Goddess
Hidden lusts will break the gates and swarm
As love secretes the thrill for war
The virgin raped shall seek to whore
She-wolf bare your snarling jaw
Thee I invoke, a bornless one
All woman, pure predator
Wherein conspiracies and impulse dwell
Like a seething fall from grace
Thou art darkest Gabrielle
Lilith rode the steed
Thou art dark Hecate
Rising from Thessaly
Sunset, expect
This to be your last with Our vast return
As Death is set
At three sixes where hill beacons burn
Darkness, undress
Your descending skirts yield a thirsting altar
Blood-red, yet still unfed
Lips distend ending, time to falter
Welcome, arms tied down crucified...
The slaughter
Lightening freezes seven
Outtakes from the rape of the world
Sins expelled from Heaven
Now befoul from the bowels of Hell
Where the tragic in theory and practice fell
Last prayers hang in the air
Each unto their own rag and bonemeal saviours
Strung where crippled vultures dare
Coughs another cross to grave God's failure
Once the forests spired
Nurtured in Nature's heart
Now dreat cedars feed the pyres
Need-fires lit for greater harm
As Her children toy with razors
Sightless and deeply scarred
And the moon arose to phase Her
Cracks a grin so wide it hides the stars
And lights Our path back through the shattered glass
We come like drumming thunder
Tides enwreathed in scum and plunder
Kraken-teethed to tear asunder
All those too blind to see...
Where the tragic in theory and practice meet
Deranged, uncaged
We rage like a plague through this age of greed
Sowers of discord, growing wars to reap
A terrible crop to beat a vicious retreat
Scorched Earth, rebirth
Disintered in the writhe of the lone survivor
Whose worth is worse than the curse
Of Sardonicus choking on his own saliva
Who shares the last laugh now
Dead wedded fates fulfil their vows?
Foot in mouth of sacred cows
Face down in dust and poisoned ground...
Glory and praise to thee in all the steeps
Of Heaven where thou didst reign, and in the deeps
Of Hell where fallen thy dream, silently.
Your misery is worn as a veil
To hide bewitchment of the ugliest kind
In place of eve a bitter parody hails
Daggers from the swagger
Of a sodomite's concubine
Gilded cunt
Oh, you gilded cunt
Your thin pretence overstretched and sickly
Feigns love and light a long time laid in the grave
My preference leans to killing you quickly
Scissored in the gizzard
That a heart no more maintains
But I am tied
To the labyrinth and the beast
The one-way track of eyes
Black and grey like panzers
Loose your shell
Shoot the mouth
The gates of hell
Have often dropped their jaws about
Satan's agents were perversion to bear
Side to side with their diversions
You use to guide my fingers there
Dirty little gold digger
Cunt
Gilded cunt
Oh, you gilded cunt
Cunt
Nothing is above you save a boreal light
That halo paid for by a consummated ring of ice
And below you, will I see you tonight
Glower from your tower
Built of ivory and spite?
For I am torn
Between the sheets that keep me borne
And the teeth of a storm
They reap then rape my stanzas
Click your heels
Three times six
The stars are fixed
May I climb and get you one?
The palace at Versailles never held your tongue
Nor did heaven ever weather
The crosses that you came upon
Dirty little soul frigger
Cunt
Gilded cunt
Oh, you gilded cunt
Cunt
Take you pain and shove it up your asshole
Tonight is the night
The empowering wind that draws breath from despite
Roars beneath my wings as I soar with the end in sight
Choirs ignite
A swansong for Leda
Deathknells for Troy
Tragedy blooms from one act
I am nemesis
Poured in my arms
When my daughter's eyelids closed
I swore to slaughter those
Who stole my ray of moonlight
So strike up the skies
The diction of thunder
God-given rites
No fiction can deafen the fact
I am nemesis
Cowled in the utter grief
I am the priest of a new disorder
Whose flag unfurled
Bears a hatred for the western world
The is no compromise
No piped lament
To stay the blind
Just a shrike cacophony of war
Ashes ember, fires rise
No longer am I paralysed
Now I drown in a loss worth fighting for
Black is my heart
I am nemesis
Black is my heart
I am nemesis
Nemesis
Tonight is the night
The city sweats fever, the filth in her womb
Shifts like the season's unease at the hands of doom
Restless inside
Her split underbelly
Suitored with flies
Martial bowels now contract
I am nemesis
Poured in my arms
When my daughter's eyelids closed
I swore to slaughter those
Who stole my ray of moonlight
Never again
Our enemies entertained
I toy at the clasp of her chain
And remember the fight
Cowled in utter grief
I am the priest of a new disorder
Whose flag unfurled
Bears a hatred for the western world
There is no compromise
No piped lament to stay the blind
Just a shrike cacophony of war
Ashes ember, fires rise
No longer am I Palestined
Now I drown in a loss worth fighting for
Black is my heart
I am nemesis
Nemesis
Foul snake despair
Where once you darkened gardens
Another coils there
Where twice you sliced all hope from me
And left these present scars
An insane love now burns above
The weft of incandescent stars
Hilt your dripping fangs that range
Skywards to rend apart
I might have sang of wings unchained
But long before I locked my heart
A fit and perfect stitch of foreign parts
Whose beauty fostered poets
Whose laugh like silver bells
Thawed your bitter winter from my path
Foul snake despair
Where once you peddled secrets
Another spoils there
With speech that sweetens drowning
In deep lagoons of eyes
And legs that begged apologies
For lengths that mesmerised
Spare your hissing sentiments
For her fee welts more than thine
Though no malice she weans
Just a palace of dreams
Where windswept chambers pine
Whose hair-spun onyx is run with gold
Her rouge lips smack of dark blood
Her name in whisper rolls
Forever on my tongue
Lest her memory dissolve
Once crucified
I would have died
A thousand more times
Just to feel her breath
On my neck as a fervent lover
To drown her sighs
In floods of tears so well refined
And blind from spying her
In the arms of others
Buried inside
Where she's all but mine
Save for those that dine
Oh her, on her perfect carcass
Foul snake despair
Where once you wreaked my misery
Another toils there
For long lost Gabrielle
Whose nightly spreading grin
Persists in other faces
By whom I'm slowly taken in
Pour the emerald wine
Into crystal glasses
We will touch the divine
Through kisses catharsis
Let us pitch to the seven-year itch
Of the ultra-decadent
To a tainted world and the painted girls
That our fantasies spent
Tripping through boudoirs laced with opiate themes
Sipping the bizarre, tasting copious dreams
A toast to those most sacrilegious of days
Where for every whim won
One soon repays
We touched the stars
That now laugh from afar
At we, the damned
The damned
We have spent our time
Drenched in opulent splendour
But when midnight chimes
Will gilded souls surrender?
Let us drink on the giddying brink
Of pools of excrement
All manner of shit for the glamour and glitz
Mephistopheles lent
I remember the night as if it were engraved
A bright marble bridge stretched across the dark waves
To the shore from the moon and by her grace
Came that erudite stranger
That fucker
He was a predator, creditor cold
Our blood was shed on the yellowing scroll
And all that glittered was not gold
But we wanted everything
And for it all, lost our souls
Come my friend, to fate let's raise
Two finger shots at this our last soiree
For tomorrow I fear
Swoops all too deadly near
This precipitous weir to Hell's high gate
We touched the stars
That now laugh from afar
At we, the damned
The damned
He was a preditor, creditor, cold.
Our blood was shed on the yellowing scroll.
And all that glittered, was not gold.
But we wanted everything,
And for it all, lost our souls.
Our souls
For it all lost our souls
Our souls
Evanescent like the scent of decay
I was fading from the race
When in despair, my darkest days
Ran amok and forged her face
From the fairest of handmaidens to
A slick perverted wraith
Nymphetamine
Heaving midst narcissus
On a maledict blanket of stars
She was all three wishes
Sex, sex, sex
A lover hung on her death row
I was hooked on her disease
Highly strung like Cupid's bow
Whose arrows hungered meat
And the blinding flare of passion
In the shade of narrow streets
Where their poison never rationed
All the tips they left in me
Two tracks
Something passed between us
Like a bad crack
Upward-lit
I'd met another kind
Of rat
In fact
With every Rome inside me
Licked and ransacked
She haunted at the corners of my mind
In black
Cataracts
Wouldn't whitewash away
Her filthy smoke stack
She burnt me like a furnace
For my future suicide
Lead to the river
Midsummer, I waved
A 'V' of black swans
On with hope to the grave
All through Red September
With skies fire-paved
I begged you appear
Like a thorn for the holy ones
Cold was my soul
Untold was the pain
I faced when you left me
A rose in the rain
So I swore to thy razor
That never, enchained
Would your dark nails of faith
Be pushed through my veins again
Bared on your tomb
I'm a prayer for your loneliness
And would you ever soon
Come above unto me?
For once upon a time
From the binds of your lowliness
I could always find
The right slot for your sacred key
Six feet deep is the incision
In my heart, that barless prison
Discolours all with tunnel vision
Sunsetter
Nymphetamine
Sick and weak from my condition
This lust, a vampyric addiction
To her alone in full submission
None better
Nymphetamine
Nymphetamine, nymphetamine
Nymphetamine girl
Nymphetamine, nymphetamine
My nymphetamine girl
Wracked with your charm
I am circled like prey
Back in the forest
Where whispers persuade
More sugar trails
More white lady laid
Than pillars of salt
Fold to my arms
Hold their mesmeric sway
And dance her to the moon
As we did in those golden days
Christening stars
I remember the way
We were needle and spoon
Mislaid in the burning hay
Bared on your tomb
I'm a prayer for your loneliness
And would you ever soon
Come above unto me?
For once upon a time
From the binds of your holiness
I could always find
The right slot for your sacred key
Six feet deep is the incision
In my heart, that barless prison
Discolours all with tunnel vision
Sunsetter
Nymphetamine
Sick and weak from my condition
This lust, a vampyric addiction
To her alone in full submission
None better
Nymphetamine
Sunsetter
Nymphetamine
None better

Two tracks
Something passed between us
Like a bad crack
Upward-lit
I'd met another kind
Of rat
In fact
With every Rome inside me
Licked and ransacked
She haunted at the corners of my mind
In black
Cataracts
Wouldn't whitewash away
Her filthy smoke stack
She burnt me like a furnace
For my future suicide
Dim the lights, wrong the rites
Toss the puerile cross away
We are gashing from a venomous womb
Burning bright, dead of night
Pyres stain a milky way
Lust is splashing the dark side of the moon
In the Samhain mist
We lay in welcome by the western gate
With the five fold kiss
For every soul returning
From the fecund abyss
Where nature's travesties congregate
With a stone cold wish
To see the wicker man burning
The wind, she whispers
Through the graveyards of our hearts:
Wreathed in dreams
As she weaves her witchcraft
We breathe, enamoured
Of the conquering dark
Harvest past, fires cast
Ashen shades this Halloween
We are set now to Beherit the earth
Widdershins, death begins
To fashion fete to gallow scenes:
Spirits rising to discredit rebirth
In the Samhain mist
We lay in welcome by the western gate
With the five fold kiss
For every soul returning
From the fecund abyss
Where nature's travesties congregate
With a stone cold wish
To see the wicker man burning
The wind, she flitters
Through the forest of our hearts:
Wreathed in leaves
As she weaves her witchcraft
We breathe, enamoured
Of the conquering dark
I will trace the knot of serpents in your hair
Plot your face, then ascending marble stares
You shall pluck me, masked, from roses-in-despair
Tasting my blood
That runs from worming tongue like prayer
Under pagan veneer snakes a fear
That makes the stars
Grieve, just to be
Uncharted on this eve
When part of me chars a path
Through your heavenly constellations
Back to black, hinges crack
Rituals call obscenities
Sheets of demons rush insanity skies
Tread the salt, the dead exult
Preachers beg our clemency
Seeking warmth in inhumanity's eyes
We who kept the candle by the vault
We who kept the candle on the cult
The time has come
To rise again
Freedom lift thy sewered hem
Free from beasts and skewered men
My dreams unroll
Ten thousand fold
Their world will never take me
They will never desecrate my soul
The stars I have grasped
Are so far lonely constellations
And wishing on those stars
My spirit bars annihilation
From earthen miseries
Hosts of most fell forms of greed
Ghosts of pearly gate remissions
Forever haunting me
Slit the witch and watch him bleed
As with any inquisition
Lying from the start
The preachers piled their craft
Scoffing elder glories
And dying, I depart
To make their sunken hearts
A coffin for their stories
The time is past
The falter when
Freedom slips my sombre pen
And the gates to wolves break open then
My feelings may
Seem constant prey
But claws no more will rake me
Those whores have fled to darker days
Above and beyond
I have wronged in my position
But now the winds are strong
To soar from Babel's vision
Of cutthroat jealousies
Dock to dock these mongrels breed
Dogs of fogged derision
Pacing, soon to be
Back to pack mentality
When my killing moon is risen
Trying from the start
These creatures of the dark
Were quaffing morning glories
And dying, I depart
To make their drunken hearts
A coffin for their stories
Innovation in ovation
Imagination stirs
Somewhere the dusk is lining
Red the shore of a roaring sea
And though loved there is someone pining
For the waves of blood to run and rescue me:
The time has come
To rise again
Freedom lift thy sewered hem
Free from beasts and skewered men
My dreams unroll
Ten thousand fold
Their world will never take me
They will never desecrate my soul
Their world will never break me
They will never desecrate my soul
Seven brides serve me seven sins
Seven seas writhe for me
From Orient gates to R'lyeh
Abydos to Thessaly
And Sirens sing from stern
But now I cease to play
For I yearn to return
To woodland ferns
Where Herne and his wild huntress lay
Now the tidal are turning
Spurning the darkness
The great purgations of distinguished tours
Are but stills in time
To the thrill that I'm
Once more
Heading to the bedding
Of her English shores
The wind bickered in Satanic mill sails
Eyes flickered in deep thickets of trees
And mists clung tight in panic to vales
When Brigantia spoke her soul to me
From Imbolg to Bealtaine
Lughnasadh to Samhain feasts
I heard her lament as season's blent
Together a chimerical beast
Now the tidal are turning
Churning in darkness
The celebrations of extinguished wars
Are but stills in time
To the chill that climbs
Once more
Dreading the red weddings
On her English shores
Gone are the rustic summers of my youth
Cruel winter cut their sacred throats
With polished scythes that reap worldwide
Pitch black skies and forest smoke
And the hosts that I saw there
Drones of carrion law
Drove the ghosts of my forbears
To rove and rally once more
One of her sons from the vast far-flung
Come home to rebuild
The rampant line of the Leonine
Risen over pestilent fields
Now the tidal are turning
Burning in darkness
The salvation of her hungry sword
Shalt spill like wine
From the hills to chines
That pour
Spreading her beheadings
On these English shores
For the hosts that I saw there
Drones of carrion law
Drove the ghosts of my forbears
To rove and rally once more
This is a waking for England
From it's reticent doze
This is a waking for England
Lest hope and glory are regarded as foes
There hides a secret
Deeply twined inside of her mind
A tried and confined egret
That pines to fly south
To this mouth of mine
Pity
Too long have these emotions
Like potions, made me
A sole castellan
Trusted to keep
The weight of oceans
From her rusted gates of sleep
A dreaming angel
Lying curled in the circles of Hell
I must protect her
Watch her back for any cracks to occur
For in the witching hour
She slips into the underworld
A pearled Persephone
Deflowered by the powers
Hat around her
Down her
Whirl
Doomed to damn the rift
Across the shifting abyss
With her body and it's gift:
My filthy little secret
I serve her slender hope
To preserve mankind from old ghosts
Disturbed though by recurring crimes
I sense that dead
Might be best for both
Pity
Too long have these emotions
Like potions, made me
A sole castellan
Posted to keep
Slow wheels in motion
From the human race to beat
Without her there
My nymphetamine with the faraway stare
Thin walls would crumble
Horrors would corroborate from dogstar lairs
For in the dead of the night
She spasms with orgasmic flare
This reamed Demeter
With Poseidons there inside her
Too appeased to grieve our air
Doomed to dam the rift
Across the shifting abyss
With her body and it's gift:
My filthy little secret
Forever sworn to keep it
My filthy little secret
Pity
Too long this urchin princess
Has incensed, made me
A wanton felon
Searching for the key
To loose her harness
And set desires lurching free
Without her there
My nymphetamine with the faraway stare
Thin walls would crumble
Horrors would corroborate from dogstar lair
But in her room at night
I care not for the underworld
Slathering and gathering emboldened Reichs
To breach, to teach
A dread thereafter
I would risk all this
For one minute of bliss
With her body and it's gift
My filthy little secret
Forever sworn to keep it
My filthy little secret
I know a deeper beauty shines
Beyond the veil
Her roots and creepers mine
As the worms beneath rise
Forgive the day's
Last serenades
Her skies they bruise like Nordic women
Deep crimson stains
That Death would claim
His robes of office swim in
As would I
For his dark eye
Has fixed, a basilisk, a scythe
On charred remains
With shared disdain
For those I chose to mortify
Their cries
Have paralysed
And the smoke has choked these vistas
But still I lie
Though tears have died
On the grave of my Clarissa
A verse for her whispered to the earth
A lover's curse is a see-through coffin
Praises her curves so oft concurred
Though she was
No Snow White on the night she died
Her shadower's boon when the moon glazed over
Lipped with blood and secrets pried
For on and in they spread her wide
That seraph bride
The Devil's pride
Shalt soon avenge with swift reprise
But they would writhe
For my dark eye
Bewitched, was fixed like Mordecai's
On Esther's reign
And in this vein
I saw their lust still stain her thighs
Their cries
Have paralysed
And the smoke has choked these vistas
But still I lie
Though tears have died
On the grave of my Clarissa
Beneath these trees where the mist enwreathes
Her spirit flees, seeing chains of torches
A fleeting kiss stirring leaves of poetry:
I was
No dark knight, breaking men like ice
I was like a lycanthrope until the moon glazed over
Lipped with blood and last goodbyes
Now I dream
Enwrapt in pure clouds of the sweetest oblivion
Where beauty streams
Freed from the teeth of those beasts that had come
To tear out her spells
In red lettered cells
Wherein even the crown prince of Hell
Come out of his arrogant shell
Would falter to better
But her face soon dispels
And as black feathers fell
From heaven's smoke
So I woke to insanity
Her exquisite corpse
Found fit for their sport
Of course
Would burn on the morrow with me:
And there on this night
Strung up in my sight
Naked she sways
Displayed for their vulgar delight
I scream through my bars at the stars
That for these crimes of mine solace me
I will fear not the flames
That to passion are tame
Not nearly the same searing pain
I pray As held sway upon losing her
Nor the mettle of roars
That will settle like ashes and scores
As with our ghosts in the fog
When we both turn no more
Mother of abominations
Our Lady Overkill
Smothering the congregation
Grips the cosmic wheel
A lover of acceleration
No mercy or brakes applied
I see dead stars collide
In her cold unflinching powerslide
Comets tear the skies
Gushing from a shattered silence
Never so alive
Like the rush of cum on nymphetamines
Minds desanitized
Nightchords rung on a ladder of violence
Darkness fantasised
Sleek and polished black
Instrumental in stripping Gods
To neuter and mute their staves
Thereafter
Her laughter
Shalt sound aloft their future graves
Heavens above
Fear the Gorgon eyes of a new moon rising
Except no love
When she enters your golden halls
Millennial the whore
Riding wide astride the horns of madness
Clarions forth the war
Spilling the wine of her fornication
Perennial the gore
Filling the lines between split nations
Seeping under doors
In time tides force a wider crack
Mother of abominations
Our Lady Overkill
Smothering the congregation
Licks the royal milk
The scourge hangs at her girdle
Death slathers near her heel
Seeking blood to curdle
When the gathered clouds reveal
Her roared abortive labour
Thighs slick with molten steel
Dripping into sabres
For Vulcan spawn to wield
Instrumental in stripping Gods
To neuter and lash her slaves
Thereafter
Her laughter
Shalt sound aloft the crashing waves
Heaven's above
Fear the gorgon eyes of a new caste rising
Expect no love
When they enter your golden halls
On sanguine floods
Hear the foregone cries of the last surviving
Skewered like doves
Outside the wailing walls Mother of abominations
Our Lady Overkill
Smothering the congregation
Grips the cosmic wheel
A lover of acceleration
No mercy or brakes applied
I see dead stars collide
In her cold unflinching powerslide
Comets tear the skies
Gushing from a shattered silence
Never so alive
Like the rush of cum on nymphetamines
Minds desanitized
Nightchords rung on a ladder of violence

Midsummer, I waved
A 'V' of black swans
On with hope to the grave
All through Red September

For once upon a time
From the binds of your lowliness
I could always find
The right slot for your sacred key
Six feet deep is the incision
In my heart, that barless prison
Discolours all with tunnel vision
Sunsetter
Nymphetamine
Sick and weak from my condition
This lust, a vampyric addiction
To her alone in full submission
None better
Nymphetamine
Nymphetamine, nymphetamine
Nymphetamine girl
Nymphetamine, nymphetamine
My nymphetamine girl
Wracked with your charm
I am circled like prey
Back in the forest
Where whispers persuade
More sugar trails
More white lady laid
Than pillars of salt
Keeping Sodom at night at bay
Fold to my arms
Hold their mesmeric sway
And dance out to the moon
As we did in those golden days
Christening stars
I remember the way
We were needle and spoon
Mislaid in the burning hay
Bared on your tomb

Nymphetamine
She is open wide, She isn't hard to please
She drives me fucking wild I want her on her knees
She floats and insists I am hot and can't resist
She suck me to the core
Now I can't take no more
That Bitch
She turns me to a beast
Bestial lust
Come on Bitch
Each tendon muscle rippling She drink my sove with greed
She fuck my helpless body and she just raise the speed
She let her wet tongue roll I gasp and can't control
She is hot and drives me wild and still she is open wide
Just when this torture seems to end
She is there to drain my sove again
Come on ride, to ride on me bitch
Bestial Lust
I've had nothing but bad luck
Since the day I saw that cat at my door
So I came into you sweet lady
Answering your mystical call
Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she cast
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind
Give me the ring on your finger
And let me see the lines on your hand
I can see me a tall dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned
I drank the potion she offered me
I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I came there for
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind, hind
Stay away, you cunt
If you're out on a moonlit night
Be careful of them neighbourhood strays
Of a lady with long black hair
Trying to win you with Nymphetamine ways
Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
You'd better get out of there fast
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
A voyeur in league with the great thief night
In an overthrow of woven light
Slid in to rob the prayers
She whispered to the air with thin deliberation
Spare me from the wolves
Clawing past my door
Tear me from the ghouls
That start to gnaw my fingers
Following Her heart
And every beat that spoke
I kissed Her risen, naked
Soft white throat
Incense lit at perfection's feet
Has never burnt so sickly sweet
As the fragrance of Her breath
When Her lips met death with such imagination
Bear me to the moon
The dour toll of bells
Scare me with their boon
Of Winter's bitter graveyards
Swallowing Her fear
I veered beneath Her coat
Of soft white meat on
Soft white throat
Crepuscular, the lust in Her
Went supernova
Setting maps aflame
Before Her veins ran colder
And muscular, the final thrust
In Her spilled over...
Covering Her back
I saw an angel lift Her coma
I fell to eyes
Of a bestial past
That once, teaching grief through jaded pupils
Now shone like celestial glass in Hell
And doused in the glow from Her parting gift
Never there lay, with curves like snowdrifts
A beauty so frozen in bliss...
Slumped to warm the dead to a standing ovation
spare me from the wolves
Clawing past my door
Tear me from the ghouls
That start to gnaw my fingers
Following Her heart
And every beat that spoke
I kissed Her risen, naked
Soft white throat
Crepuscular, the lust in Her
Went supernova
Setting maps aflame
Before Her veins ran colder
And muscular, the final thrust
In Her spilled over
Smothering Her cracks
I was the devil on Her shoulder
"Dear Lord I cry, before I die
Grant me the taste of love
One final time lest I should hide
When seraph call me from above
And should remorse not stay my course
From debt, addresses wept
Will ask no more of you my Lord
Save that my soul in Hell is kept"
Nightfall, in thrall
I call her beauty to me
Whose ebon-lidded eyes excite
Shadows to wander through me
Whose kiss glittered with sleep
Is a thief come after dark
To steal away the leaden wreaths
From my cemetery heart
Nightfall, in thrall
I call her beauty to me
Whose ebon-lidded eyes excite
Shadows to wander through me
Whose kiss glittered with sleep
Is a thief come after dark
To steal away the leaden wreaths
From my cemetery heart
Thrilled to see the light
Bruise-reddened, silhouetting
Murder sites
As dusk attends her sons' blood wedding
Spilt across the skies
In reefs of omen
Licking flames and pagan rites
The night awaits with baited thighs
Start this artist darkness
Yearning now to start this
Burning as an artist
Turning on the darkness
Dizzy looking up with pervertigo
A sewer deity of recrement
World below
I'll make you pray
I spy with wicked lips
The cream of mortal kind
Committing their sins
Their penitent skins
To the harems of my mind
Prey
Thrilled to breathe tonight
The sultry air of graces
Passed in flight
Like birds of May with playful faces
Fills me with delight
Their crystal skirts
Spun from stars, worn tight
Wink of fists in wishful places
Start this artist darkness
Yearning now to start this
Burning as an artist
Turning on the darkness
Dizzy looking up with pervertigo
A sewer deity of recrement
World below
I'll make you pray
My whims like smoke in summertime
Writhe atop the blooms
Committing their thin
White Catholic limbs
To the cloister in my room
You see I need
To feed my dreams to order
To be agreed
With the beast in me
That bleeds their borders
Prey
Nightfall, in thrall
I call her beauty to me
Whose ebon-lidded eyes excite
Shadows to wander through me
Whose kiss glittered with sleep
Is a thief come after dark
To steal away the leaden wreaths
From my cemetery heart
Mr. Crowley, what went on in your head?
Oh, Mr. Crowley, did you talk to the dead?
Your life style to me seemed so tragic
With the thrill of it all
You fooled all the people with magic
Yeah you waited on Satan's call
Mr. Charming, did you think you were pure?
Mr. Alarming, in nocturnal rapport
Uncovering things that were sacred
Manifest on this Earth
Conceived in the eye of a secret
And then scattered the afterbirth
Go
Mr. Crowley, won't you ride my white horse?
Oh, Mr. Crowley, it's symbolic of course
Approaching a time that is classic
I hear that mating call
Approaching a time that is drastic
Standing with their backs to the wall
Was it polemically sent?
I want to know what you meant
I want to know
I want to know what you meant
Go.
Carry on my name
For those who choose to mouth the curse
A tragic serenade
With Judas in my stride
The Gothic halls of shame
Where statues coldly hold no worse
Than the murders I reclaim
From a dark, forsaken time
Kissing heaven, spent
He wipes lips free of his hectic discharge
Wishing to repent
For the brute that ravaged free
In slight hands beauty weeps
Conquest's deep methodical screwing
Hurt repeatedly
Like the world wound at his feet
As it is written, damn it
So let it be wrung
From throats of those in overthrow
The past at last has come
A savage bit without respite
Pervades the freezing air
This winter chill, grist for his mill
If tears of joy will blear elsewhere
And church bells drown in the cracks of doom
The storms above us hew
As lightning runs like bifurcate tongues
Deflowering two by two
Hissing, malcontent
He storms the skies on electric discharge
Pissing in contempt
On the effigies of the weak
Killing all resolve
The great beast simmers, his scarlet women
Spit their vitriol
On the terrified face of peace
As it is written, damn it
So let it be wrung
From throats of those in overthrow
Our past at last has come
A hellbound heart, the rose and thorn
Have locked to hasten blood
The moon disrobes, to harden droves
Of legions pouring
These rivers press, his breath adorns
Senates and enemy seats
Whilst his power takes as ingratitude
The writhing of the weak
Wormwood my name
The poisoned star that fell to earth
And blistered free of shame
In the pits of self-rebirth
Now those caves become a Garret
Overseeing endless barracks
As the waters turn to claret
And the Vatican satins burn
I will give to drink without cost,
From the spring of the water of life.
He who overcomes will inherit all this...
And I will be his God... and he will be my son.
When contrary winds blow across the sands
Their murmurs can be easily swayed
But when storms quicken one cannot placate
The howling of their murderous rages
Winged seraphim hold love's trembling hand
Beside our waiting graves
As war roars about out precious land
Seeking cause to subjugate
Tonight in flames
Tonight the world will fear our names
Tonight in flames
Stay my feeble heart
Our deaths will be the start
Of something glorious and vain
Tonight in flames
There is no fanaticism as virile as faith
To the blind his words are clear
Suffer not the infidel! Suffer not the infidel!
Assure your place in paradise here
Winged seraphim hold love's trembling hand
Beside her tiny grave
I will avenge her, do or damned
Her sacred mother did the same
I went to see her dance one day
In a play by a wailing wall
Now she is gone
But the song lives on
Zealous and maniacal
But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, 
those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars
their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. 
This is the second death
The Eastern sword must fall
Tonight in flames
Tonight the world will fear our names
Tonight in flames
Stay my feeble heart
Our deaths will be the start
Of something glorious and vain
Tonight in flames
Her soundtrack now a bombing raid
Bored of vaudeville
God was six days sober
On the night that she was born
To the glistening star of a bible class
An icon now in religious porn
She was Alice through the glory hole
An ejaculate misconception
Disney-esque, the high priestess
Of greed and deepest dark deception
All best to bury whims
For Miss Libertina Grimm
She, that little red riding crop
Brer Werewold at her stocking tops
Beneath the tightened leather strop
Of the basque of the houndervilles
At the stroke of midnight come
She polished verse and hearses
In a poisonous pen dipped in omen
To her surgeon full of general curses
In the hand of morgue redeemers
Though the dead always pleased her more
Squatting in their coffins
Flirting curtsies to the thirteenth floor
Tip your hats
For sweet Libertina Grimm
Fantasy and candy stores
Snow white and the seven straws
Smoke and mirrors on all fours...
Her brothers grim, her sisters through
The final dance will be the cue
She amputates to fit the shoe
Mystery kindled in a blackened room
Nine candles lit to improve the gloom
She sees the dark as she feels womb
Full of hidden secrets
They haunt her heart, those precious few
Those Count Lestats and Betty Blues
Those tortured souls just like me and you
Full of hidden secrets
No, don't go
Don't you leave me
So alone
No, don't you go
Don't you leave me here
So alone
Where the dead are free to roam
As lonely as a poet on the wall of Jericho
Or the moon without the comfort of the stars
I am loathe to know it that a man without a soul
Is nothing but a split canopic jar
I proved it, improved it
Drove a sonnet right through it
And in this state of bliss
Evil kissed with wet lips
Pen-filled fingertips
Which drew me, for through me
Illuminati usually pissed
But with words of some hurts worth
I threw a party that extended God's list
Exciting new flames that my fame would claim for me
Reciting back the almanac of travesties
They call me bad
Mad Caliban with manner
Dangerous to know
A passing fad
Taught in all debauch
Grown wild this child
Whole harems defiled
Faustina's and Mina's
Lady Libertine and her sisters between her
What spread of lies arise when lovers die
Which circle of hell is mine when I arrive?
They call me bad
Mad Caliban with manners
Dangerous to know
A passing fad
Taught in all debauch
Crow against the virgin snow
Grown colder, my shoulder
Like a boulder beside her
And bolder, not wiser
My dark seed took up root inside he
That mouldered, where older
Beddings would hold a passionate sigh
Merited a forest of inherited spite
Fleeing grief for foreign maps
I still played vampire aristocrat
Unloading my gun in hot, promiscuous laps
Then shooting swans in a gondola
I tripped my foot on a fallen star
And there's nothing like a mouthful of Venetian tar
To let you know just who you fucking are
The patron saint of heartache
You can't see my world is falling
The world is falling down
The patron saint of heartache
Can't see the world is falling
My world is falling down
Ever after, can they hear my laughter?
The patron saint of heartache
Never craft a better bed of disaster...
The patron saint of heartache
They call me bad
Made Caliban with manners
Dangerous to know
A passing fad
Taught in all debauch
In excess and in canto
They call me bad
Mad Caliban with manners
Dangerous to know
A passing fad
Whereupon I tell them
To go fuck their mothers
As so...
On my grave
The needle in the eye of the hurricane
The poison in the font
The nail in the coffin of the profane
I am the lot
Maniacal the fire
That weaves inside my should
When dripping tongues of hate, envenomed, roll
Like carpet bombs in vast bazaars
My blood runs with the beasts
Though no crescent, cross
Or wandering star
Shalt witness my defeat
Born of jackal in the Vatican
To a loathsome flock I have crept behind the drapes
And a wizard there is not
Just a white flag blackened by
Singing weapons that have led
A faith that soon dominions over
Desert kingdoms of the dead
I smell the fleur du malcontent
The hellish stench
Of Judas in the dozens
Bouquets for greed and twisted law
Handmaidens of a holy war
Bring on a thousand roses more
I am the thorn
Tangled are the thickets
That spare the virgin heart
From the waking grasp of rapists in the dark
Mountaineers that strive so far
For a Heaven grown from reach
That love herself is fabled
To be missing from their peaks
Save in one sole tower
Where the presence of a rod
Stays the sleeping beauty
From the prying fingers of the mob
I smell the fleur du malcontent
The hellish stench
Of Judas in the dozens
Bouquets for greed and twisted law
Handmaidens of a holy war
Bring on a thousand roses more
I am the thorn
I am the thorn
I am the Spear of Longinus
The sword of Damocles
Kali up in arms, a bleeding sinus
The hammer of the gods in the prophet's teeth
Saint Disgustus, President Evil
Great white hopes of a shark-eyed people
Light of the world now flicker and die
Impaled in the race, in the paling face
Where forked tongues pricked the skies
Choking on these words as I slither to their ear
A lightning strikes their blinded mains
I am not the hand of god...
I am the thorn
Territorial thieves
Ever stealing thunder for religious causes
I will bring you all down to your knees
And fuck you over
We rise with the sun in the underworld
We suffer from a graveless name
We prise wide lids
And wounds with lips curled
Over teeth that have tasted shame
Cemetery and sundown
Against the flora of nightfall
We gather like the fauna of war
To cure Aurora so spiteful
With her stake in the coming of dawn
To conjure forth the past
Those heady nights of pain resplendent
In the service of the Goddess of Death
When her sheets ran royalty red
Moon lengthen or crypt-kept silhouettes
Shadows dance, eyes flicker in descent
Unveil the greed, our needs are bitter, spent
On upturned mouths and haunts of wickedness
We walk this Eden, a secret
Faces hidden under Leonine pride
In dusk's embrace
We find it hard to keep it
When blood and lust and waking worlds collide
Too long have we skulked like drifters
In the cities of the neon sun
Vagabond dogs and graveyard shifters
Mona Lisa's where the paint has run
I miss our glorious past
Our nightly flights on fear dependent
Like phantoms in the eaves for Miss Christine
When the song bird broke her neck
Wolves howl their fogbound serenades
Churches arch their backs with balustrades
Praise be to the shedding of masquerades
When we hunt these vestal vermin unafraid
Of the covenant made...
Draw the blinds on the floors of raw meat
There is murder in the thirst
Rich red vascular tapestries
Hung in gilded frames of nuns asleep
In dreams where themes of bestiality
Are a blessing on their Sunday sheep
Sermons hang a black gown
Over cemetery and sundown
Now the clock is harrying midnight
And the ghost of yet-to-come
Will she show rewrites of dark delight
Or the sewers we've overrun?
I see a winter palace
Cut diamonds at a porcelain neck
When Swan Lake crushed poor sanity's spirit
As I threw her to it bled
We rise with the sun in the underworld
We suffer from a graveless name
We prise wide lids
And wounds with lips curled
Over teeth that have tasted shame
We walk this Eden, a secret
Faces hidden under Leonine pride
In dusk's embrace
We find it hard to keep it
When blood and lust and waking worlds collide.
One might see in Mina
My disease
But it was She who has infected me
For all eternity
As the sun slips the tearaway stars
Into the scented scheme of night
I kissed her mouth like a dark red rose
Set upon a marbled dream of white
So pure of thought like a Vestal statue
Jewelled with a God-lent grace
I was close to coming when she bid adieu
Fuelled by heartache rent upon her face there
On Mina, obscener
Thoughts obsess my days
Oh Mina, obscener
Thoughts possess me
That I must now obey
They say the darkest hour
Is that before the dawn
When nothing in one's power
Can dissipate the great forlorn
Shadows of fire that haunt me
Like risen whispers of her name
For dawn is a dusk
Wherein needs must
Erupt from the grave, aflame
Written in the dead of night
And riding on the burning wind
Smitten by her read delight
My words alight like leave of sin
Stepping through a mirror
The princess of the emerald glass
Brought me on sip nearer
Love's infernal past
They say Hell hath no furies
Like a woman scorned by life
When the Heavenly Judge and juries
Participate to chain this wife
With forced virtue, Her secret needs
On warm we nights, with storm-wracked bites
I gave her Eden after the flood
Written in the dead of night
And riding on the burning wind
Smitten by her read delight
My words alight like leaves of sin
Brides of old and goddesses all
Forgive my wishes to be always near her
Forever or whenever seas recall
The Aphrodite from my embrace
For as Mars whom her lips placate
I tore these shores with wars of hatred
Before our Paris wet his fate
In Helen, one might find mistake
In winning tragedy
For all eternity...
I am still lovesick for Mina
I am still so lovesick for her
I'm chaos international
The writing on the wall
A Lazarus in parable
A dark and sullen lullaby
Whispered softly as you die
Promising torments are nigh
Danger warning levels hissed out loud
I saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
Now I'm reeling from the shock at ground zero
If yesterday you would have stood up proud
Then why tonight have you thrown in with the stoning crowd?
I'll breathe through the foetus of a new day kicking...
The foetus of a new day kicking
It's true that Jesus cannot save
I'm rising from the grave
To put my double cross to shame
A poison rush, a heart attack
A white assassin painted black
You'll fear this reaper coming back
Danger warning levels hissed out loud
I saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
Now I'm reeling from the shock at ground zero
If yesterday you would have stood up proud
Then why tonight have you thrown in with the stoning crowd?
I'll breathe through the foetus of a new day kicking...
On a night like this
You laid the serpent's kiss
In this garden of Gethsemane
You played the traitor well...
In a dawn to come
I will blind the sun
To grant you pardon as my enemy
Before damning you to hell...
One dark afternoon
Like a shadow I flew
Through the rain that fell sick with lament
To this house of incest
For when we undressed
Blasphemies against Venus were rent
Though a sister removed
Her white body approved
The parade of my heavenly quests
Yet, all tongues are not true
Some are forked or askew
Like an uncivil serpent's at best
For ousted from Eden
I fausted all reason
Hook in mouth like Saint Peter Pan
To haunt fairy groves
And hot virgin coves
Where in the promiscuous swam
I elected lovers and rejected others
Mathistrisses that don't give a damn
But for those that still do
My deep interest grew
The rise of the true pentagram!
With the snow fallen thick
And bonfires alit
And shooting stars portents of rips
I ascended to spur
A mere glimpse of murmur
From her precious celestial lips
Be it sun to your moon
Be it moon to your sun
Together we promised to come
With a turn of the screw
And a slip of the tongue
We eclipsed one another undone
Through the mist, through the woods
With the night-wraiths I've stood
Atop murderous peaks calling you
On storm-lashed beachheads
Where the fisherman dread
The things your bewitchments accrue
Those deep creatures bring
Her cut diamond rings
A girl with a pearl necklace her
Advancing in fevers
Tsunamis and myrrh
Will she wreak bloody vengeance or purr?
She lights the skies
Dressed in silver scales plucked from the ocean
To spite her thighs
That Lucifer snuck inside
And with his pride
Enclaves were upgraded to Goshen
So paradise
Could shine from out her skirts
I adorn myself at dusk
With ornaments to close the noose
A kiss as red as blood and cold as hell
My body glows with lust
Anaemic as the flag of truce
I raised at dawn to catch you in my spell
With every twist I cannot resist her
Fertile female mind control
This wanton witch, white rapids sister
To whom I pour my wine and soul
From a copse of black yews
Where the moon was drawn through
Like a sword through a Gordian knot
She descended to me
Claiming swift victory
Over the heart I had near soon forgot
With every kiss this huntress whispered;
Yield to my sweet embrace
One night of bliss". I could not dismiss her
Once her beauty shot me a darker face
You mesmerise my soul Diana
You mesmerise my soul
I've never been closer
I've tried to understand
That certain feeling
Called by another sound
But it's too late to hesitate
We can't keep on living like this
Leave no track
Don't look back
All I desire
Temptation
Keep climbing higher and higher
Temptation
Adorable creatures
Temptation
With unacceptable features
Temptation
And trouble is coming
Temptation
It's just the high cost of loving
Temptation
You can take it or leave it
Temptation
But you'd better believe it
You've got to make me an offer
That cannot be ignored
So let's head for home now
Everything I have is yours
Step by step and day by day
Every second counts I can't break away
Leave no trace
Hide your face
Full of desire
Temptation
Keep climbing higher and higher
Temptation
And you can take it or leave it
Temptation
But you'd better believe it
Step by step
Day by day
Every second counts
I can't break away
Keep us from temptation
Lead us not into temptation
Trying to find it
Temptation
You've got to get up behind it
Temptation
Put your dime in the hot slot
Temptation
But it's a million to one shot
Temptation
You think that you're right
Temptation
Your gonna face it tonight now
Temptation
Give me a breakdown
Temptation
Because it's time for a shakedown
Temptation
They see me there
Their eyes are everywhere
Sniffing at the linen for the dirt
I feel their burning stare
That hate will later flare
And writhe upon their women full of hurt
Lace magic ink with venom, critics
Milked from infant teeth
Though scathing blows are so arthritic
When they're set on slow repeat
They know I care
Smell storm clouds in the air
Hissing at the bit above my heart
But though I dare
The dyed black route of splitting hairs
I favour not to tempt the poisoned apple cart
I feel two needles rising
Snake eyes are hypnotising
I know they seethe, despising
All that we possess
I feel two needles rising
The truth is always blinding
Their lies, unappetising
Toxins to digest
They breed nightmares
Dark horses of despair
Taking twisted courses in the art
And were I there
To bet my bones on grave affairs
I'd have their guts for garters from the start
I feel two needles rising
Snake eyes are hypnotising
I know they seethe, despising
All that we possess
I feel two needles rising
The truth is always blinding
Their lies, unappetising
Toxins to digest
It's not without hate to crawl flat in the filth
As other less basilisks fly
And brothers are clasped to the breasts of a sylph
As their royal loves slither to die
So shedding dead skin, working true colours loose
Renewing the red in their eyes
They coil like sin within thinning excuse
Cold-blooded to sharpen the lies
Uncivil serpents, race deceivers
Disfigureheads varnished with fevers
Snake-house creepers in our dreams
Of Eden, flee before we mean
To throw the worms out with the waters
Rife with hated spawn
And set a sword to whirl and slaughter
All vipers at the gates of dawn
Wishing in contempt of love
The righteous came to burn our forest
With hissing firebrands
For though we serve the gentle curves
Of our serpent-girdled Eastern Goddess
They thought they caught us
Kissing hearses in their land
Send away the pumpkin carriage
Blind mice in your head
Parade themselves like sacrilegious
Envoys of the dead
For in this house of the dark Madonna
Flesh will pleasure life
For free of sin we would dishonour
All that virgin sacrifice
Gut our city, slaughter all within
Save the gold that goes to God
Show no pity for we worship sin
Spare not the old nor lightning rod
We raise our devil horns
To those who sit on high
For down amidst the thorns
We lie
Tonight the black guards came to rape
And ruin those souls empathising
With fleeing far away
Thrown to the Tigris river curves
Of our star tiara-ed Ishtar rising
They thought they caught us
Courting Baphomet
Gut our city, slaughter all within
Save the gold that goes to God
Show no pity for we worship sin
Spare not the old nor lightning rod
She walked the world
When the world was made to dress
In a perfect darkness
A murderess in flame
Nature curled, unleashed, unfurled
The crack of a whip on the lips of anger
Why would your holy order
Not be wholly slain?
Wishing in contempt of love
The righteous came to burn our forest
With just verses for the damned
For though we serve the gentle curves
Of our serpent-girdled Eastern Goddess
They thought they caught us
Pissing curses in the sand
We raise our devil horns
To those who sit on high
For down amidst the thorns
We lie
We raise our devil horns
If this world is wearing thin
And you're thinking of escape
I'll go anywhere with you
Just wrap me up in chains
But if you try to go alone
Don't think I'll understand
Stay with me
In the silence of your room
In the darkness of your dreams
You must only think of me
There can be no in between
When your pride is on the floor
I'll make you beg for more
Stay with me
You'd better hope and pray
That you make it safe
Back to your own world
You'd better hope and pray
That you'll wake one day
In your own world
Cause when you sleep at night
They don't hear your cries
In your own world
Only time will tell
If you can break the spell
Back in your own world
Stay with me
Stay, stay with me
Polluting the honesty of Christ with poisoned wine
Laced with lines from the end of time
From the herald and the bugler
High voltage bolts the cellar door
Switch thrown at midnight's peak
To start the heart of a scarlet whore
Gauged infernally
A poetess in night's profane station
Threading lies like silver seas
A seamstress for an amputee nation
Wedded to depravities
Devil to the metal
Diluting the authority of life with sewer brine
Laced with grime from the spiral of time
Wherein spins cruel order
The big hand strokes the Little Horn
Not thrown for charity
To win the sins of the decadent, born
To wage eternally
Passion rides the great unholy
Ipsissimus of love's despair
Her ashen grin would shine, if only
Death would not sit smiling there
Her beauty freezes reason
Like Helen at the reins
Of the rampant horse Apocalypse
On the shore that it was made
Devil to the metal
She fucks at unknown angles
Bleeds her victims to the bone
And in their guts untangled
Casts her runic eyes of stone
She will violate the future
Annihilate the past
Paving way in butcher trades
The red brick road through mankind's arse
Abandon reason, life the veil
Darker seasons are released
Storm crows gather in black masses at the pane
Go to sleep beyond the pale
She is set to murder peace
Under pregnant skies I come alive like Miss Leviathan
Dripping with the ripples of concern
All of heaven's eyes are fixed, as only my desire can
Tear them from the stars I start to burn'
I am She
Lilith
Mistress of the dark
Of Sheba
First offender
And succour to demons
Whose sweet seductions and wicked rites
Lead all those too enslaved by the flesh
To trespass against God's holy law
And tonight I come for you
Midnight strikes, the candles sputter
Muttering their recking spells
I snuff their tongues, my heart a-flutter
These words i speak are gates to Hell
The scent of death is rent
In this ornamental verse
In ventures down the centuries
Tormenting me with secrets so anathema
And now the fires grate
I must relate, to end this curse
I'll break through spires to escape my fate
Am I too late or just perverse?
Midnight strikes, the candles sputter
Muttering their recking spells
I snuff their tongues, my heart a-flutter
These words i speak are gates to Hell
So the blight begins
Near the woodland of a frightened village
Where the rites of unimaginable sin
And the howling on the wind
Chills the blood for fear of spillage
Where nightfall used to be
Blessed with best tranquility
Its no caressed by misadventure
Templars from the crusades
Have birthed a church, more masquerade
In which they worship mass dementia
They came from dust and flame
By the Red Sea on dead shores
fleeing claims of blasphemy
And bestiality
Devils fed them back to us
Knights of holy wars, inviting hordes
Of grim infidelities
In the grip of cryptic lands
And desert sands
They found just cause
and midst their entourage
Under the stars
They Bought relics and parts
Of saints
And evil left to clerics charge
With Muslim plunder they built their sect
To the composite Baphomet
An androgynous sphinx, open, erect
Universal in its closet display
Spawn of Lilith and Samael
First offender and the snake
In thrall like pawns beneath its spell
The templars grew to astute surrender
Sabbatical, fanatical
They Adorned its monstrous bust
Whit a kings ransom of Easter jewels
The embodiment of beast and lust
Many moons the proved the boom
Of immutable and beautiful
Darkness ever-afters
Then one eve when the ancient trees
Outside, drew back, unnerved
The pleas from those impatient teased
Something from the black beyond of nowhere
A stunning woman, summoned
Comming scimitar-curved
Statuesque, but living flesh
Draping nakedness about their pagan saviours
She came Lilith, a perfect myth
The scarlet whore
Skinned in magnificence
In her defense
She only slew a few of them
Born of a sacrifice, a virgins price
For the merging with a Goddess
She prowled the world again
Enslaving men
With the surging of her bodice
Midnight strikes, the candles sputter
Muttering their recking spells
I snuff their tongues, my heart a-flutter
These words i speak are gates to Hell
The Feast of Fools,
As January slipped into the grip of winter
A leather leash tightened round the throat of fate
Amidst the flock, disease and dementia
Night was blighted more than ever before
With screams of lust and obscene adventure
And scenes of raw debauch
The darkness was aroused with every kiss
And all who fell under its spell
Were one foul step from the abyss
One foul step from the abyss
Sacred village there in All Hallows Fair
Feared the templars and their Queen
For Lilith compared to a royal nightmare
When she steered their tempestuous
Fever-dreams
The beast was loose and beauty party
To the horrors of this sonorous whore
A seducer, Medusa
A frozen Hecate cloned
Stealing seed, here needs were like a cancer
Growing stronger with each whimpering dog
knelt before her, thirteen necromancers
Called from desert sands to this land of opportunity
The darkness was aroused with every kiss
And all who fell under its spell
Were one foul step from the abyss
One foul step from the abyss
love was drugged by a copious vendor
A train of servants for here decadent games
Purring on rugs in fugs of opiate splendour
Vain Lilith spread her wings again
Stars, they gasped and comets in ovation
Lit the towers, their very presence declared
They watch with lust, despair and veneration
For the Goddess scatted naked there
The painted eye of the storm
Plagues of sin, played to win
All hearts and souls in thrall
to her embraced, her fatal whims
Desire meant to conquer all
Until that fateful day, 1308
With a force blessed by the Kings of Hate
Facing winter gray to disintegrate
Once noble halls
The villagers in a belligerent horde
Fraught daughters fanning flames
Rose like pillars for their militant Lord
Thoughts of slaughter haranguing hot veins
They assailed the fort beyond the woods
as the howling broke on the stroke of midnight
Many lost their sanity at what they fought
Amidst those walls, creed of dementia
Annihilated by sheer weight of the surge
Put to the sword, freed from their calenture
The great estate was given straight to the church
Of Lilith, no limb ranked amongst the dead
But that she drank the blood of many men
That dark night it was said
The world was her cloister, the abbess Duboir
In the convent at All Hallows fair
A pearl in an oyster she shone like a star
Augmenting her sisterhoods prayers
Her singing touched Angels and melted their hearts
her choirs inspired the search
For the lost holy grail, the Benedict arts
And the best of the Catholic Church
But if one thing
One precious little thing
Would darken this facade
There would be such consequences
Like the night Sister Victoria
Stepped in from the freezing cold
No candles would light at Evening Mass
The days passed by without a sigh
But dusk came thick with dread
Intangible, the air was full
Of wanderlust and approaching bloodshed
In truth, the Abbess with her pious whims
Enjoyed the new girl's pain
Proof to the rest tat the briars of sin
Entangled all the world in Satan's name
Victoria Varco, once heiress
To a proud noble estate
Fell pregnant by her recklessness
Who then fell foul to a violent fate
Such was here cime in expedient times
And the shame of besmirching her name
Her child was burnt, she was dragged to these walls
For a life in obedient chains
But not one thing
One precious little thing
Would darken this facade
Like the night Sister Victoria
Woke screaming in her room
She spent a week spiralling from heaven
And as the seasons wheezed and pained
Her dream grew more perverse
For no good reasons she would to find
An alluring woman naked save for jewels and verse
When here eyelids close, on a moonlit shore
This intoxicating beauty would appear
The sweetest symphony composed
Those abating lips rose
Tho whisper dirty secrets in her ear
Clandestine secrets
A dream within a dream
She finds hereself this nymph
Abreast a desert dune
And below the crescent moon
Atop a darksome stranger
Ah, the spurting of his seed inside here
Triggers paradise
She rides the beast until the heavens trembled
Forcing eclipse, her lover licks her blood
That drips upon the sand
And almost out of hand
Coarse plots assemble
For somewhere in the convent walls
A templar treasure rests
Forgotten to the vestibules
Like pleasures of the flesh
So, in return for nightly runs
Past tongues and wisdom's hiss
She promised to assist the hunt
for an ancient golden chain amiss
She slept in ecstasy
In hands that fanned her wildest fantasies
Freed from Christ's frigid regime
And rigid nails...
She was first in church
To lick her lips and self-debased
Each waking second felt like heaven
In the scarlet One's embrace
And at last, clear memories, aghast
Relinquished their control
All things held dear to the wretched past
Coalesced within her soul
Madness crept into her sight
Though her sinful hair
Spoke of nothing to the contrary
Once dulled eyes leaped alive with life
Her piece of broken mirror
Barely recognised
The worm was turning
For her sat grinning Victoria
Who, no three weeks ago
Was flogged red to euphoria
For her dour love of God
And the ardour of his crows
Cold cloisters kept the dead apart
At the Retreat of the Sacred Heart
She stepped in ecstasy
Neath skies that plied her wildest fantasies
Freed into love's reacquainted dream
And sudden gales...
Night grew sultry late September
A man came from the village
Through the woods
To help with harvest
She was burning like the fields
All her vows lay unfulfilled
His name was Isaac, silent, blessed
A mute whose tongue impressed her lately
But now red skies darken
The roonks lament
Windswept maelstroms harken
The approach of Lilith's
Nightmare kingdom
The woman in her astral dreams
Became more vivid, livid, obscene
Scatted on the throne of oayx blasphemies
Emanating raw desire
And the surging urge to scream
Darkness crept into her face
She stood erect
And spook of riches and their whereabouts
Finding in Isaac the need to place
A hidden Templer necklace
Lest the month run out
For now stormed the vainglorious
In her palace of mass delight
Her power dawned victorious
Victoria the key, her mind unfastened
By flights of morbid fancy
Psychomancy, rites of ancient wrong
Sweet seductions, peaked cruptions
Spiking through impatient song
Cold cloister kept the dead apart
At The Retreat of the Sacred Heart
The gate to hell was forced apart
At The Retreat of the Sacred Heart
At the very start
There were whispers in the dark
And for all the world to see
There was witchcraft at its heart
And on the autumn air
The scent of bonfires everywhere
And a fell wind stirred the leaves...
The persecution song
Telltale signs of possession
Little Miss Demeanour in the demons bed
Gasps she just could not suppress
After lights-out midst the dead
And a past on which sin cast its darts of wickedness
Time was running faster for disaster
Strange nights were burning
In the furnace of her dreams
A name was uttered, Lilith
Mistress, playmate, master
Such sights were stolen in the throes of ecstasy
And in the thick of all
In the Black Goddess's thrall
With the wood unseen for trees
Victoria stood tall
Promiscuous in step
The Devil breathing down her neck
As jealous zealots stitched apiece...
The persecution song
Telltale signs of possession
Fickle Miss Demeanour hissed and disappeared
To her Sisters of the cloth
She now reeked of Astaroth
Again the curse had surfaced
Sneaking back the pagan years
Weaving webs of great revealing
Hidden in the convent
An evil libido abided, undone
Breathing, deceiving
Feasting on her deviant feelings
She'd clung to her crucifix
Once her torturers begun
Her screams came quick
The miserichord
Den to vice and screw
That had reddened many tongues
Wrung symphonies
Of suffering from her
Many moons hardened pure hearts
Those plagued by her black arts
Their rooms secreting phantom orgies
Vile rites and rifled graves
Mere hours, now towered
Above this bent and beaten flower
Her naked body privy to
The Abbess and her ways
Victoria fought
No guilt was wrought
Just a torrid retort of blasphemies
Nails and crosses vomited forth
From this pretty little whore now arched like Hell
Arched like Hell
At the very start
There were whispers in the dark
And for all the world to see
There was witchcraft at its heart
But then the end grew nigh
A dirge inferno filled the sky
In its customary key...
The persecution song
Telltale signs of obsession
No wailing banshee would dishonour their name
Nuns dragged her to the blasted oak
Storm-clouds threatened holy smoke
They hanged her there like Judas
With the Hellcat in her reined
Time was running faster for disaster
Exorcism, torture, gallows
Now a shallow grave
A name was stuttered, Isaac
Tongue-tied, simple, bastard
They made him dig the pit
Mindless of what it claimed
On the night all mirrors fell silent
And the clocks struck accord with the rain
A storm swept in with such violence
The dead rose to complain
The stars were ill-crossed as the weather
Lost in its bitumen cloak
The Angels were warring, slick with endeavour
Falling like tears through the thickening smoke
Blood redeems, heaven torn asunder
A flood of souls scream on the rolling thunder
Blood redeems, heaven torn asunder
She stirs from dreams barely three feet under
Victoria, I come to claim my prize
Stealing from the convent neath the wrath of seething skies
For though you greased the palm of Satan
With those moonlit silver thighs
I knew the beast took second place
When I looked into your eyes
Your deceiving eyes
Filled with lies
And missed good byes
And serpents hissing revelations
Your deceiving eyes
They tell enough
Of how I fell in love
With the goddess creeping deep inside you
And with the tumult up above him roaring
Isaac sought her shallow grave
As lightning bolted through the grim down-pouring rain
He struck the hallowed earth again
Having torn at the soil like a man insane
Не threw his fists at the poisonous cosmos
And from that pit of shame
He bore the coffin from her sorry lot
Neath trees whose eaves were knotted with rot
Through ornate chapel doors, unlocked
To splinter her sarcophagus
And gaze upon her face
Victoria...
Victoria, I come to claim my prize
Stealing from the convent neath the wrath of seething skies
For though you greased the palm of Satan
With those moonlit silver thighs
Making mockery of rosaries
His needs will never rival mine
I recall a summer's day
The sunlight bathed your penitential scars
As I sat and washed the blood away
Now your body stays
And the coldness of your lips
Eclipse
Like the first true kiss of winter
Pining for the dead
On the stone floor spread
She was shining through her winding shroud
A moon amid the mad, this son of Adam had
A gift for the pretty young nun
A necklace wrought of twining snakes
Two gold illicit tongues
He laid it at her throat
Where the rope had wrung
He was burning from the furnace
Of his roused desire
He wrested with temptation
To be or unfulfilled
She was undressed for ovation
Her sumptuous form, the storm revealed
And with his driven lust exploding
Her lashes brushed his cheeks
They flickered with life, her limbs enfolding
Purring, licking wicked teeth
Victoria, I come to claim my prize
Stealing from the convent neath the wrath of seething skies
For though you greased the palm of Satan
With those moonlit silver thighs
You have left him just for me
I see it in deceiving eyes
Those deceiving eyes
Filled with lies
And missed good byes
And serpents hissing revelations
Those deceiving eyes
They tell enough
Of how I fell in love
With the goddess re-arisen in you
Church bells resounded like judgement day
As they were making love
In the rainswept graveyard
She fucked him hard, silhouetted by flame
A monsoon Tigress set upon prey
Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more master the faster the days
Lilith Immaculate
This delectable reaper
Her eyes were profound
Drawing him in deeper
Until he was drowned
Hurled on the shore
Of the world underground...
Lilith Immaculate
Mortal kind, a morbid wine
For this dark moon goddess
And freed to stretch her claws
This beautiful whore
Would be brutally honest
Tortuous one, taboos undone
A glittering star on a sea of myriad waves
And a thickening mist, a seductress
Leading lovesick hearts astray
Lilith
In the throes of orgasm, she bucked and he broke
At the height of the storm, the chaos they'd smote
Burning behind her in arabesque smoke
Framed a vision transformed as she sucked from his throat
Victoria smiled, her now golden eyes
Possessed a regal bearing
Of omnipotent power
From wet lips to her smouldering thighs
Her beauty perfected and her will agonised
Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more the master the faster the days
Lilith Immaculate
With dread single purpose
Her mind told him stay
She strode through the fire
Desire aflame
She murdered the nuns
In such horrible ways...
Lilith Immaculate
That night we lay entwined on hay
Inside a soldier's barn
Her panting breath an opiate
As in her bolder grasp
I caught the scent of desert sands
The Holy lands, the fall of reason
But only when I smelt the blood
Did I fear her colder hand
I am darkness, I am sin
The Queen of lust invited in
Reborn at last to cast my
Fecund shadow on this world,
You shall worship me, enslaved
For many lovers shall I crave
And in return, I'll gladly pave
Your psycho path with pearls
For I have been grating
And waiting so long to find
The most perfect hostess close to me
Whose thin-ice troubled mind
Was like a cracked, black ornate mirror
To slip right through in time
When at last I wore Harmonia's necklace
The cursed twin serpents mine
Tortuous one, debauchery won
The attention of Emperors, Princes and Tsars
For the toll of her kiss, no soul could dismiss
The advance of her throne from afar
This English rose with traits of those
Who graced the harems of the East
Adorned with thorns, she raised the horns
And scarlet hems to wasted priests
Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more master the faster the days
Lilith Immaculate
This delectable reaper
Her eyes were profound
They drew him in deeper
Until he was drowned
Hurled on the shore
Of the world underground...
Lilith Immaculate
Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more master the faster the days
Lilith Immaculate
The flutes and sweet wine
Of her voice anodyne
Her power was growing
Every hour malign
The truth, Lilith's kingdom
Drew closer with time
Poets racking absinthed brains
Could never fully paint these nights
No martyr parting from his pain
Could utter words so erudite
As those she now divulged to me
In throes of passions grip
Indulging latent fantasies
That ran forked tongues along the lip
Of fate's pudenda
The twisted snake's agenda
Now the world would bend
To her deadly legacy
Life's graveyard was waiting, such dizzying flight
From the convent at All Hallows Fair
Without contemplating, we fled through the night
Too blood-drunk and cunt-sated to care
The Goddess had spoken
And woken desire
It crackled in the air around us
A psychic force shimmering like fire
And on her breasts. that old necklace
The one I snuck from the fucked Abbess
Whose dirty little secret, other than me
Now shone with bold intensity
Vast the power it possessed
The darkness Brought to living flesh
This treasure was ancient, taken by force
From an elite caste of priests in Delphi
The Templars were patient, they stayed out the course
Then fleeced their Greek hosts in their sleep
That necklace traversed
Vile murders and miles worse
But what was a curse
To this perverse demoness?
Legend swore it was a gift of malice
For the maiden Harmonia
The illegitimate spawn of love arid war
Jealousy made it gleam for her
For with it clasped, her looking glass
Was ever beautiful and young
But disaster choked her royal caste
And every throat on which it hung
There madness, death and horror clung
Immortalised in mortal guise
She was a sight for blighted eyes
A plague to gladly plagiarise
And spread like red excited kisses
She was more than me
More than words
Could fulfil in the parlance of the angels
She cast a spell on every cell
In my nobody
She gave me back my tongue
That she might run it on herself
She was Lilith. she was light
I was but a parasite
Beckoned to temptation
In her velvet overtones
Through frozen antics, dressed in white
She led me into paradise
Neath comets in ovation
Like the Queen of winter, throned...
Pleasures archetypal
Then much rarer agonies
I was a sworn disciple
Of her whims and dark decrees
In Europe's hair
Her spies were everywhere
A sylph amongst the filthy rich and debonair
Her greater plan
All chaos and the all of man
For as she fed dark appetites
She bred her children there
The spawn of love and war
Presiding over Hellfire clubs
The spawn of love and war
She rode the beast. her legs apart
A blazing pyre starter
Life's playground elated, such dizzying sights
And sensations ignited her grin
As slaves celebrated her Satanic rites
We climbed up to heaven in sin
She came to me
As she will come to You
Intoxicating in her seduction
Her siren sway. devastating voodoo
Persistent, resistance is useless, fool
To this Goddess, in lust she's cruel
Beyond any measure, her pleasures will found
A perverted Eden on sacred ground
vast the power I caressed
The darkness brought to vivid flesh
And in it she now rules a cowered universe
Where does the madness end?
How far down do the rungs expire
In smoke and burning heat?
In depravity and sin?
In her shocking retinue
I saw the worst
Desire run amok amongst you
And in her boudoir too
The endless nights embedded
In her beautiful cocoon
Turning black and blue and jaded
Kneelin at her feet
My heart atrophied at her ravishing form
The ultimate test
Her cult obsessed
With this body of the Goddess reborn
When she first laid me to rest
I saw such sights of wickedness
From this harlot on a pedestal
This scarlet Woman scorned
I glimpsed desertion, the bluster of shame
The tribes of the moon. their lustre improved
A morbid aversion to the limpid domain
Of Eden and Adam her dark temper moved
I witnessed reverie then
Perverse resurgence, souls on fire
Blood and seed spilt for centuries
For this imperious bitch
In her shocking retinue
I saw the worst
Desire run amok amongst you
A gnawer of taboo
Dread appetites were threaded
Right throughout the mortal zoo
Her immortality now hungered
I remember, in Thebes
Enthroned with cat-skinned girls
Her long dark hair braided with pearls
A red gown split revealed her thighs
As full lips rose to feline eyes
Egyptian black outlined each lid
It's clear who owned the pyramid
Temptress Lilith
Her beauty stirred me more than words
Could ever paint, her bible hurt
Tempered Lilith
Hissing in the dark
Pissing on my heart
I was missing every part of Victoria
Victoria
I found them hypnotic, the years of display
Of court life and parties, political bite
Narcotic, erotic, her bleary soirees
Left daylight a dream in the scheme of the night
The scheme of the night
But I grew uneasy, she wanted the earth
For now she was spinning her sins
Breeding fell children and hiding her worth
Before the new orders disorder begins
Feeding from the weak
Savaged on their feet by her ravaging lust
Evening-dressed
This young Countess
Led lovers astray under cover of dusk
When she took them to her breast
They passed last rites, deliciousness
Swept into their every pore
This matriarch of darkness bored
Harlot on a pedestal
The night orchestral
Harlot on a pedestal
Never vestal...
Forgive me Father, I have sinned
Darkness put her painted claws in me again
Her vision drowns like service wine
Whispered kisses so divine
I was blessed but now I've come undone
Storm clouds roll out overhead
Above their master
End of all flesh, end of all days
Love predicts disaster
In her precious ways
I was burned, a sacerdotal soul
By the Demon Queen of my dreams
Infatuation turned to total control
Her rose was sweet
But her thorns were barbarous
Love me
And worship me
I'll lavish you and ravish you
Fulfil all wishes and fetishes too
Many never want to see
Many never want to know
The truth behind their fantasies
Their deepest needs
Let alone be shown them
Forgive me Father, I have sinned
Darkness put her painted claws in me again
Her vision drowns like service wine
Whispered kisses so divine
I was blessed but now I've come undone
Nothing left to do but run
Sodom rolls out modern death
On casters ever faster
End of all Flesh, End of all Days
The stars predict disaster
In her bastard ways
Love me
And worship me
I'll nurture you and hurt you too
Fulfil all wishes for my sad Aladdin
She comes to me
Like a sandstorm in an hourglass
A whirlwind of desire
I am hypnotised
To think beyond the pale
Beyond heart-stopping eyes
And sopping thighs
I'm won't to fail
A wicked spell cast over me
Addicted to her utterly
Despite the horrors that gestate
Beneath the beautiful
I'll grant you life beyond your ken
The envy of all other men
Whatever vice will make you spend
Eternity with me
Satan's concubine
She makes her crime scenes shine from heaven
Forgive me Father, I have sinned
Darkness put her painted claws in me again
Her vision drowns like service wine
Whispered kisses so divine
I was blessed but now I've come undone
All mirrors lead to my palace
My exotic pleasure temple
Wherein my court is both gracious and insatiable
Pure and obscene
For where pumps the true heart of life
There too seeps corruption
And from this my new Eden of nightshades, black
henbane, sphinxes,
opium and roses weaned on tears and blood
Will rise up like lust
And the shadow of my dark consort shalt extend
Himself across the face of the world
And Hell will come with Him
Part of the garden, her dark Eden
Fed blood by poisoned fronds
My heart hardened in her wet season
Treading mud in her slough of despond
But only now
A path lies straight before me
The maze is ploughed half through with hate
Andpher crop is dripping red
Beyond eleventh hour
Her beauty and brute power
Grows stronger by the day
And with each rose that she deflowers
The longer her throes of madness stay
In her grip on shredded sheets
Once our fingertips had dug and clutched
She whispered dreadful things to me
She wanted war with God
The underdog baring sharpened teeth
With her armies raised from suffering
To ascend on jet black wings
She'd break off holy limbs
On the racks of her witch hunt
And crush the church beneath her heel
The Pope in homage to her cunt
A dark horse forcing nightmares
To wring submissives dry
A vampire madam batterfang
With vicious streaks a mile wide
Beyond eleventh hour
Her kiss has turned dismissive
Her glance holds slight contempt
Instead those eyes burn on the prize
Of fates she really likes to tempt
In her grip on shredded sheets
Gasping from conquered peaks of passion
She whispered dreadful things to me
She wanted war with God
The underdog baring sharpened teeth
With her armies raised from suffering
To ascend on jet black wings
She'd tear down mighty spires
Then rear them up anew
Orders forged to her desires
The eleventh hour nearly through
Lilith, the abyss, the slithering mists
That cause all souls to stray
How to resist those seductive gifts
On the shore of her unholy ways?
She calls my name so softly
From deep banks of scented fog
I almost lose myself before it starts
But my spirit keeps its silence
As I drift across the lake
A glimpse of harem secrets
Now her velvet curtain parts
She is glaring like the moon
The wind dies down. eavesdropping
As I bow before her throne
And she descends to greet me
Like the royal bitch to which shes grown
Come closer, what have you to say?
Black cat got your tongue?
I am not your slave
Nor are you my saviour
I hold those cold deceiving eyes
Her once hypnotic gaze
And pledge eternal love. then walk away
Thunder seethes behind me
Death adjusts her favourite mask
Another lover smothered by her sanguinary darkness
Clasped in the garden, here you heard
This story blustered through
I asked her pardon, swore my word
I'd score her sweetmeats just like you
For only now
The truth lies prone before me
I couldn't leave her even if she stormed
The heavens as were promised
Beyond eleventh hour
Lilith, the abyss. the slithering mists
Will come for you this eve
Lustrous the cusp of her lingering tryst
Before those fatal kisses bleed
Beyond eleventh hour
She will make of you a plaything
Scant amusement for her bed
And when naked flesh forgets to sing
She'll take your fucking soul instead
Midnight strikes, the candles sputter
Muttering their reeking spells
I snuff their tongues, my heart a-flutter
These words I speak are gates to Hell
Kill a man and you are a murderer.
Kill millions of men and you are a conqueror.
Kill everyone and you are a God.
Born of the best of enemies
Beyond the pearly constellations
Wherein heaven has no embassy
And hope no surly grip on reason
Satan; gold and murder
He is sly, bejewelled with sylph
Slick limbs spread wide to guide you through the filth
And rust
Crawl to him fuelled by lust
He's the horned one in the pentagram
A waste of chaos by the gram
Dark eyes for trouble, double damned
Despair
The storm upon lake Lacrymose
Restless. never comatose
The thorn upon the single rose
We share...
Germination
His a renegade a Capella now obeyed
A shitstorm without warning
The pleasuit King In Yellow on parade
Son of the thunderous morning
Satan: gold and murder
He is high. inured with vice
The tower-cree er on our edelweiss
Career
A foreign power cut of utter fear
Taught curiosity, he s atrocity. banned
The taste of chaos by the dram
A tortured course like slaughtered lamb
Best rare
The curse that haunts this thirsting tomb
Disturbed, becomes the worst of doom
Rehearsing all his worth for soon
He's there...
Extermination
He is hatred. greed and war
He is everything we ought abhor
Were it not for the fateful truth
Be sure
We suffer him all the more
his tyrant's eye
Is fixed upon our rich and vibrant sky
Now hear the wind
Herald desolation
As on that eve when angels clad
In nothing but their whispered virtues
Slipped into the valley
Of the dirty serpentine
Hes the horned one in the pentagram
A waste of chaos by the gram
Dark eyes for trouble, double damned
Despair
The storm upon lake Lacrymose
Restless, never comatose
The thorn u on the single rose
we share...
Desperation
Disdainful. he self-deprecates
The mirror's jagged stare
And it's painful how we subjugate
The grinning face reflected in there
Satan; gold and murder
Mother's milk has soured
My life's a bolted door
And from it runs a trail of vagrant gore
My wounds are open flowers
Fragrant gifts for my encore
Bouquets of praise for bleeding, towered
On the sacrificial floor
I summoned and you came
To the peel of twisted bells
To the gelid whisper of my name
I blanched, erotic danger
Had me whirling like a star
To the dark advance of strangers
And then I heard you laugh
A throat of broken glass
Leather stitched to weeping skin
A coat of death and suppuration
Be my truth and agony
An architect for my total destruction
My erector, my dissector
My flesh will be wet for your best seduction
Be my truth and agony
inventive and deranged
Loves proof is in, its plain to see
The fluids we've exchanged
Part of these soul killers
The Gestapohood of scars
Carved an ornate invitation on my heart
The scent of French vanilla
With the stench of abattoirs
Past tense of present laythings
On those stained red lips ajar
I summoned and you came
From the churning guts of Hell
With your Christmas hiss of chains
Down the endless centuries
Your torture bed of lust
A shrine for us to redesign
And sign in blood and rust
Be my truth and agony
An architect for my total destruction
My erector, my dissector
My flesh caressed by your best corruption
Be my truth and agony
inventive and deranged
Loves roof is in, its meant to be
My cells are rearranged
I suffered and you came
To the splintering of bones
Winning pinnacles for my pain
Raped and racked and mutilated
I Raised from dregs again
Autopsy-turvy, back elated
In brazen arms that sacked my veins
Skinnatra, take me to the stars
Thrust me through to paradise
Endorphins breaking fast
Creature from the black abyss
Your tortured soul has led me
To this altered state of bliss
My number is 11, as all their numbers who are of us.
My colour is black to the blind, but the blue and gold are seen of the seeing.
Also I have a secret glory for them that love me.
But to love me is better than all things:
if under the night stars in the desert thou presently burnest mine incense before me,
invoking me with a pure heart, and the Serpent flame therein,
thou shalt come a little to lie in my bosom.
For one kiss wilt thou then be willing to give all;
but whoso gives one particle of dust shall lose all in that hour.
Ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall exceed the nations of the earth in spendour & pride;
but always in the love of me, and so ye shall come to my joy.
I love you! I yearn to you! Pale or purple, veiled or voluptuous,
I who am all pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of the innermost sense, desire you.
Put on the wings, and arouse the coiled splendour within you: come unto me!
I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge & Delight and bright glory, and stir the hearts of men with drunkenness.
To worship me take wine and strange drugs whereof I will tell my prophet,
be drunk thereof! They shall not harm ye at all. It is a lie, this folly against self.
The exposure of innocence is a lie.
Be strong, o man!
lust, enjoy all things of sense and rapture:
fear not that any God shall deny thee for this
Let the Scarlet Woman beware!
If pity and compassion and tenderness visit her heart;
if she leave my work to toy with old sweetnesses; 
then shall my vengeance be known.
I will slay me her child: 
I will alienate her heart:
I will cast her out from men: 
as a shrinking and despised harlot shall she crawl through dusk wet streets, and die cold and an-hungered.
But let her raise herself in pride! 
Let her follow me in my way!
Let her work the work of wickedness!
Let her kill her heart!
Let her be loud and adulterous!
Let her be covered with jewels,
and rich garments, and let her be shameless before all men!
Then will I lift her to pinnacles of power: 
then will I breed from her a child mightier
Oh dear God
It is midnight in the labyrinth
The night is set to taint the painted halls
Moonlight is our cue
The candelabra flicker at your passing gall
I swear they're dancing just for you
The dead leaves rustle on the manor lawns
As a light breeze whispers through
The call of wolves. the owls lament
Our screams shall soon soar skyward too
Mistress from the sucking pit
All the world crawls lovesick at her feet
The stars are passing observations
Her voice is music, her legs go on
Shes got full orchestration
And been known to use it
But trepidation is a far slicker song
Amongst dull suitors
She is bright and razor sharp
A tree of woe uprooter
A viper still at heart
Shes alkaline and far acidic
As sweet as clementines
This mistress from the sucking pit
All the world crawls lovesick at her feet
The stars are passing observations
Her voice is music, her legs go on
Shes got full orchestration
And been known to use it
But trepidation is a far slicker song
Mistress from the sucking pit
Embossed by her postulant gaze
Like Medusa on a plinth
I am lost in her embrace
Oh dear God
It is midnight in the labyrinth
A peacock fan of sinful eyes
Swim wide across the room
This night, espied, your thin disguise
Does wonders for the sundered gloom
For all lit up the shades retreat
To dark Italian pews
And corners where great vases stand
Abrim with thoughts of naked dais with you
Mistress from the sucking pit
All the world crawls lovesick at her feet
The stars are passing observations
Her needs are dire, her rites are wrong
She burns with exultation
Like a fiery vampire
For desperation is a far slicker song
Amongst dull suitors
She's bright and razor sharp
A tree of woe uprooter
A viper still at heart
She's alkaline and far acidic
Fluidic, serpentine
This mistress from the sucking pit
The waiters pass in gilded frames
With glasses sparkling too
The ball tonight rows magical
Like the finest Venice threw
And at it's heart a mythic queen
Her skin of purest hue
Whose beauty is unquestionable
But whose duties are askew
For beneath the airs and divine graces
A slim tornado whirls
On the precipice of her poisonous kiss
The devil dwells deep inside this girl
Embossed by her postulant gaze
Like Medusa on a plinth
I am lost in her embrace
Oh dear God
It is midnight in the labyrinth
Mistress from the sucking pit
The wine has sat and breathed it's last
In blood red ruby where
I find you by the roaring hearth
A blaze of golden hair
Cascading down an angel's face
To pool about the breasts
That man minds have wondered on
but only I caress
And then I'm yours. the velvet crown
Of Venus in my hands
Fists rip hard the eiderdown
Desire firebrands
Every mountain, every route
My wanton tongue must take
To taste that once forbidden fruit
Before your bloodlust starts to...
I have come from the freezing seas
From the warmth of foreign coals
Through the dismal fog of insecurities
To a cloud-enshrouded noble goal
The world has cast me from its laughter
Thrown to the wolves, to the dread thereafter
So now I forge a journey fraught
Through these bitter wastes of snow
Over ice and gorge to an Eden sought
Far from the human races afterglow
This sightless climb is treacherous to weather
As the cold bites deep, old heartstrings sever
Behind the jagged mountains
Beyond the frozen North
At the back of Boreas. The zealous wind
There crest celestial fountains
Crystal waters soaring forth
In the realm of our sacred Angelus kin
Neither muse nor music flees
This garden of delights
Everywhere the soothing hands of nature please
In this state of pure Euphoria
Paradise lies at the heart of darkness
And one must pay for this deep catharsis
Now the storm-clouds retch
A vision fleets before my eyes
Wherein minarets and spires touch
Phantasmagoric skies
And meadows stretch to woodlands
Of sweet nymph and fireflies
Death is in the breeze
And his mind will paralyse
My mind is in the clutch
Of something too long fantasised
Behind the jagged mountains
Beyond the frozen peaks
At the back of Boreas, the zealous wind
The Gods of love are counting
Down the nights until we meet
In the realm of oursacred Angelus kin
Now the mirage blears
And the howling gusts renew their fury
The gleam of moonlit towers
Fades to utter fear
The mountains rear in anger
At the righteousness I lack
And in their monstrous grasp I know
Dear God
They will never let me back...
Free of enemies, no death, disease
The doves of peace, in flight
Carouse upon the ever-Summer breeze
In this land of Hyperborea
Behind the jagged mountains
Beyond their icy stares
At the back of Boreas, the zealous wind
My soul is now surmounting
Past the grasp of last despairs
To the realm of our sacred Angelus kin
Behind the jagged mountains
Beyond the frozen North
Governed by the moon
She's a bold headmistress
I am lycanthropic
Too evolved to miss this
Opportunity to taste
The pausing lamb
By the grace of heaven
Come the claws
I am
Emerging with the hunger
Scented blood a tease
Urges surging under
Thunder bludgeoning pleas
Bathing in the afterglow
Of Set let free
On the scarlet march of woe
To a dead set destiny
True nature's stark decree
The crude dripping whipping
Off the back of need
We are lost souls amok
The raptors, scratch, Ragnarok
The crossed pounding holy flock
Like a werewolf blitzkrieg
I am stuck on a killing spree
A premature star
That shot reprieve
So fuck you Lady sympathy
Just thank your lucky scars
You're not for me
The moon is drifting
through a dark hypnotic garden
Her spells are waxing gibbous
And my heart it starts to roar
Just thank your lucky scars
Sat astride my rearing nightmares
The abhorrence King. Death bound in glory
I see their idle tide in fear now turn there
Before these evil jaws that leave no story
This rancour soon will pass
Just thank your lucky scars
Chosen by the moon
She's a cold seductress
Frozen to the bone
She's compelled to suck this
Lust from out my veins
To assert her rule
From the able mouth of Cain
Spurt the things I do
Howling at the ether
Like a beast in heat
Burning with a fever
For the seasonal meat
I shall never gloat
On what the sufferer sees
My teeth are in their throat
Blood is draining me of speech
True nature's stark decree
The brute, finger licking
From his sickening feats
We are lost souls amok
The raptors, scratch, Ragnarok
The crossed, pounding holy flock
Like a werewolf blitzkrieg
I am stuck on a killing spree
A premature star
That shot reprieve
So fuck you Lady sympathy
Just thank your lucky scars
Your not like me
Just thank your lucky scars
Sat astride my rearing nightmares
The abhorrence King. Death bound in glory
I see their idle tide in fear now turn there
Before these haunted shores of purgatory
Just thank your lucky scars
Governed by the moon
She's a bold headmistress
I am lycanthropic
Too evolved to miss this
Opportunity to taste
The pausing lamb
By the grace of heaven
Come the claws
I am
Emerging with the hunger
Scented blood a tease
Urges surging under
Thunder bludgeoning pleas
Bathing in the afterglow
Of Set let free
On the scarlet march of woe
To a dead set destiny
At the very start
There were whispers in the dark
And for all the world to see
There was witchcraft at its heart
And on the autumn air
The scent of bonfires everywhere
And a fell wind stirred the leaves...
The persecution song
Telltale signs of possession
Little Miss Demeanour in the demons bed
Gasps she just could not suppress
After lights-out midst the dead
And a past on which sin cast its darts of wickedness
Time was running faster for disaster
Strange nights were burning
In the furnace of her dreams
A name was uttered, Lilith
Mistress, playmate, master
Such sights were stolen in the throes of ecstasy
And in the thick of all
In the Black Goddess's thrall
With the wood unseen for trees
Victoria stood tall
Promiscuous in step
The Devil breathing down her neck
As jealous zealots stitched apiece...
The persecution song
Telltale signs of possession
Fickle Miss Demeanour hissed and disappeared
To her Sisters of the cloth
She now reeked of Astaroth
Again the curse had surfaced
Sneaking back the pagan years
Weaving webs of great revealing
Hidden in the convent
An evil libido abided, undone
Breathing, deceiving
Feasting on her deviant feelings
She'd clung to her crucifix
Once her torturers begun
Her screams came quick
The miserichord
Den to vice and screw
That had reddened many tongues
Wrung symphonies
Of suffering from her
Many moons hardened pure hearts
Those plagued by her black arts
Their rooms secreting phantom orgies
Vile rites and rifled graves
Mere hours, now towered
Above this bent and beaten flower
Her naked body privy to
The Abbess and her ways
Victoria fought
No guilt was wrought
Just a torrid retort of blasphemies
Nails and crosses vomited forth
From this pretty little whore now arched like Hell
Arched like Hell
At the very start
There were whispers in the dark
And for all the world to see
There was witchcraft at its heart
But then the end grew nigh
A dirge inferno filled the sky
In its customary key...
The persecution song
Telltale signs of obsession
No wailing banshee would dishonour their name
Nuns dragged her to the blasted oak
Storm-clouds threatened holy smoke
They hanged her there like Judas
With the Hellcat in her reined
Time was running faster for disaster
Exorcism, torture, gallows
Now a shallow grave
A name was stuttered, Isaac
Tongue-tied, simple, bastard
They made him dig the pit
Mindless of what it claimed
Bedight, this pre-aestival
Festival drew darkly near
And our delight at its arrival
Was a roar to rival loosed Fenrir
Let the Hellish celebrations begin
Ragnarok is rolling, magma abrim
The blackest mass the Brocken has ever seen
Invoking Loki, smoking the red weed
We listen to the Glorification
Of Chernobog in a fog of elation
Denial is the vilest form of blasphemy
Standing on the cliffs that kiss burning winds
We are risen together
Brazen, exalting, a hiss of triumph rings
I am yours
yours immortally
Tonight the rites are right for raising spirits on
The Devil's Pulpit, The Witches Altar
The dead will dance macabre
To Chaos Magick psalters
A heavy thunder shadowing lightning
Forged for Judgement Day
Announces greater wonder, citing
Heralds on the starry way
And I held you like St Vitus
As the Sabbat leapt to play
Before the fever swelled to bite us
And we were swept to waylay
May Day
Standing on the cliffs that kiss burning winds
We are risen together
Brazen, exalting, a hiss of triumph rings
I am yours
Yours immortally
Only those tortured
Could profess such festive scenes
And melodies
Of raucous wrought debauchery
No arthritic, sullen Goya
For this fresh Walpurgis Eve
Our flesh it breathes
Full of fantastic symphonies
Witness the fires reflected in infernal eyes
That blaze, alive
Eternal ties
Have trussed amazing lusts together
Procession, banquet, black mass, orgy
If our world were to cease right now
In the midst of this
Wide naked bliss, these stated sacred vows
I would break the universe in two
Just to side with you
To face the jealous heavens down
Excite the terse miscarriage
Of first light that thirsts to slay
This night versed with the marriage
Of you and I
And all who dare to stray
This night is chilled by ghosts
And the woods are full of werewolves
My heart is pounding with the stars
I feel the darkness rising
I'm blessed, addressed
By a voice of sweet caresses
Intoxication feeds
This freed reality
My inspiration speaks
Enshrined in crematoria
A sight of winged delight
Two great cherubim abreast her
Encase her grave, like once I prayed
Upon her sacred chest there
None more tragic for the lovelorn addict
Than the death of a beautiful girl
Although I was the author of sin
That compelled her wings to furl
She represents the pleasant scent
Of asphodel in this wretched world
Moonlight
Announce the presence of God again
The Ark of the Tragedian
Glitters like bright Hittite treasure
At best, obsessed
By her loss and my excesses
Judgementalism heaped
Upon the mercy seat
Means nothing to her sleep
Enshrined in crematoria
The trees are gaunt
But the cemetery beckons
Before her marble colonnades
I feel a stirring in the temple
As Israel waited with bated breath
At the foot of Mount Sinai
So I sated my wait for death
And miracles from on high
In wine and finite poetry
As fires bathed the sky
Moonlight
Announce the presence of God again
The Ark of the Tragedian
Church to her virgin measure
My tethered heart, a sacrificial lamb
Thrashes madly as the Lioness approaches
Moonlight
Announce the presence of God again
The Ark of the Tragedian
Is built on biblical pleasures
Poe-esque, grotesque
In my need for this catharsis
Her dark commandments teach
Through my prolific reach
A taste so bittersweet
Enshrined in crematoria
I find phantasmagoria
Enshrined in crematoria
Cracked Mirrors scatter reflection
Beauty falls from Her state of perfection
Good grace has fled this dream
While the cat's away the rats will ravage
Despotic, Necrotic fingers
Have lingered with Rape's Affection
Hoods face this global scene
As they stoop to prey nature grows more savage
She shudders at our foetal, fatal touch
Heavenly her body reft and left amongst the dead
Once grateful seeds in Her natal hutch
Our species breeds, deflowering the maidenhead
Religions caw epistles
Twisted laws extend their thistles
A crown to justify
Our place atop this hellbound carriage
This judgment has come from on high
Deforesters pray to the amplified sky
Stripped of her gowns, temples ripped down
Her curses hearse NOW
This judgment has come from on high
Look to her spears with true fear in your eyes
Summoning the coven, The Four Horsemen, Eschaton
She, the sumptuous Earth deep scars were forced upon
Queen Catastrophia seer renewal grew to see
Humanity in ruins sped to Death on rotten knees
We freed the flames that came to haunt Her
The greed that tore Her Elvish bodice
She was the storm that warmed to slaughter
Our selfish needs displeasuring the Goddess
Plastering disasters, faster pandemics appear
Anthropocentric pockets, last plagues are spreading near
Grand levelling with seven tongues acerbic, whore-astride
As the oceans swell in venom at our slick black ecocide
This judgment has come from on high
Poisoners choke on the smoke-ridden Sty
Forewarnings ignored, faith in a Lord
Life's blessings uncared for
This judgment has come from on high
Suffer this Kiss as She whispers goodbye
Goodbye
What have we done?
And what have we become
In this distance from our Mother
From the gates of late Eden?
Blinded, undone
Glowering into the sun
A world of mass congestion smothered
In the waste of late Eden
and what of Her?
where is jewelled Ishtar
That shone forth like the stars?
Now maniacal
Now maniacal She moves against us all
To destroy, recreate anew
To dance amok amidst annihilation
Extinction greets foul creatures left
Deflowering the Maidenhead
Displeasuring the Goddess
I wish upon a star
And think of all the things
I should have asked
Instead, I let the moment pass
And now I'm bleeding
On her faded photographs
Tears
So hard to swallow
Sorrow blears and leaves me hollow
Empty years, I should have followed
My inamorata to the grave
Uncertain words my heart denied
Now seem so trivial
I lost it all the night she died
Lies!
She is alive!
Beneath the ice
Only darkest mirrors crack this
Curse
And I, immersed
Invoke the worst
Blackest Magick put to practice
I remember then
When the Autumn moon
Would turn us back again
We'd laugh and bask
Amidst the underworld of men
Both citing Baudelaire
As our immoral saviour
Tears
So hard to swallow
Sorrow blears and leaves me hollow
Empty years, I should have followed
My inamorata to the grave
Words are so benumbing
In my head, I hear the drumming
Summoning, the dead are coming
From fetid crypts my lips create
Now grave powers start to rise
Deflowerers shall suffer
And witness to your sacrifice
Lies!
She is alive!
Beneath the ice
Only darkest mirrors crack this
Curse
And I, immersed
Invoke the worst
Blackest Magick put to practice
I think upon our time
Those golden summers
Of love echo so sublime
As do winters drinking
Too much festive wine
Now the seasons shift
Neath a creeping mist of horror
Malefic entities
I call upon thee
Vibrating cosmic threads
With shredded flesh
Manifest destinies
For those opposing me
Everyone is killable
Some just choose a vulgar death
Now we will see
What terrors shall be
The dark crimson sea
Drags the sun to oblivion
Faced demons
Arousing fire with tongues
Laced with vicious memories
Spatter twisted trees
Rape is returned a thousandfold
In the garden of unearthly delights
Only when their minds lie in ruin
Will I then hand them the knife
Towers fall like broken skies
Crashing through to Hell
Where amid the debris, angels writhe
Lies!
She is alive!
Beneath the ice
Only darkest mirrors crack this
Curse
And I, immersed
Invoke the worst
Blackest Magick put to practice
Death left me hopelessly blinded
Resigned to the wrongs of his design
I will never be alright
Never be alright
Never see the light
That shone in the heart of heaven
Breastfed red dementias
Familiar with their suckled hostess
Unhinge her bridle scold
A quest for misadventure
Wrests her glare of buckled gnosis
From bloodstained floor to holy centrefold
Death is tensing to explode
Inquisitioners sought her
Scenting the bent in her veins
Stripped and readied for torture
Enslaved to shame
The fist of humanity taught her
Scissors and spiked tourniquet
Dionysian daughter
Pressed to confess from the pain
I say, Toll the demon bell
The rotting hearts of Man
Shall light the path from Hell.
Vestal desecrators
Familiar with her secret ewers
Soon tied to licking flame
Rest their 'tests' for later
As sweet revenge from reeking sewers
Uncoils and slides amidst this unfair game
A Storm is rolling in
Unleash the fucking curse...
Striking unbiblical chords that roar
Invoke raw branded skies
As forked lightning feeds the hordes of war
Her broken hands revive
Calling the fallen
Crawling from the shadows of God
Now their fables turn, blind faith learns
Papal sermons oft have lied
Save that the coven the Black Goat governs
Is very much wide-eyed, alive
She summons proof
On virulent wings, a plague is coming
Cuntfire-hoofed
From mating with the Devil
On the torch-lit Brocken
Baphometic by design
A penchant vent for vengeance
Cut deep by horrors fought
Those dungeon-screams for mercy
Shalt keep for everybody
Nine circles down they heard her
Ten times the hecatomb
A thousand souls for those church-murdered
Dark ken align to render doom
Their punishment overdue
For sisters, missed, once powerless
Tongues torn out by the root
Fell whispers rose to a seething congress
Of spirits born for Death's pursuit
Never a dusk so drunk on lust
Caressed the cobbles red
Frights she called, the flights of Ghouls
Left little of their brittle flesh
Judgment night descended
Like the bonfire's fall of ashes
Inquisitioners slaughtered
Venting the dent in her brain
Stripped and readied, debauchers
Prepared to stain
The gist of humanity taught her
Intolerance, murder in vein
Dionysian daugher
Soon to deliver the pain
I say, Toll the demon bell
The rotting hearts of Man
Shall beat the path to Hell.
And refreshed of this dementia
Their thumbscrews,
Pears and cruel whiplashes
She turns her craft
To the next fat sacred grove
Death darkens all
Right wing of the garden triptych
Left marks The Fall
The middle ground apocalyptic
Why stay the grim inevitable and play out with a whimper?
Fate is raising coming to our faith!
NOW! The future cows!
Before the vows, prophets thunder from the heavens
We seek to justify, our seed spread far and wide
The eve that virtue died bore witness to this plague
Great hellscapes rape enflamed horizons here.....
This is the sore beginning to the war to end all wars
this hate brings fever
the great bereaver
Throw wide splintered lichgates to the eldritch show's return
Unforgiving proof accrual begs this cruel rebirth
A living fuel for the blaze of renewal razing the earth
Pariahs and messiahs of the highest worth, fodder for the denizens of risen
Hissing hell nothing screams out mercy more than vivisection of the soul
all base deceivers
Coddle abaddon, God, you got it wrong, now fall believers!
Liars and deniers, thick in mire's grasp, treacherous and lecherous
Retching a sick bloodbath
Peace sits alone midst the desecration sewn like a stony queen of winter, throned...
This is the penalty for lust- long dreaded, read in scripture, vain pleasures fed to paint this...
NOW! The future cows! Before the vows, prophets thunder from the heavens
We seek to justify, our seed spread far and wide
The eve that virtue died bore witness to this plague
Great hellscapes rape enflamed horizons here.....
a twilight for bone idols
Sewer-suicidal from the heights, a dead man's stance of prayer
Deafened ears to mortal plight
Pleas and effigies, 
clergy bang to rites belief is superficial when the missals dance alight
All death darkens all
Right wing of the garden triptych
Left marks the fall
The universe is at worst, ecliptic
Accompanied by bloodshed
beneath the Reaper's sallow craw
In league with fallen angels
Came a wolf unto my door
A portrait of perfection
Potent her siren song
I spread my dreams beneath her feet
And had them royally pissed upon
Burning with this itching sickness of a tortured soul
Cloying
She exudes a lure more animal than human
Intoxicating chemistry
Baiting masturbators with a dominant handshake
This wicked bitch
Cruella to the bone
Each vivid stich
Just ties me to her throne
In exaltation
She builds on endless lies
Mircalla, Maleresian
Architect of my demise
Burning with this witching sickness of a tortured soul
Toying
I shudder at her touch so wonderful
Akin to a helpless pin
Snatched in maiden flight by a savage magnet
She's the boot heel kiss of annihilation
Gilded cunt worship
A war of hormones swarming south
As Insects hived in her succulent skull
Make a beeline for the honey mouth
My life once breathed like a ouija board
Just ghosts of 'yes', mostly ignored
So I wished for her and like tragedy she came
Dispensing hatred
Death amongst us all
The hypnotic guest that permeates the ball
Is a creature who has leeched me, beautiful
And beguiling in enticing whispers
And lest she breaks the fall
Be prepared for shattered miracles
The moon has never shone so red and terrible
As on that night my madness rose to kiss her
Strife then seethed like a terrible sea
Buried in a life lost prematurely
Classic Poe had no horrors on me
When her claws had dug deep enough
Enough!
Once hurting, for certain
A curtain of dark ravens has risen
Asserting nevermore!
Nevermore!
Burning with the lifting sickness of a tortured soul
Joying
In the turn of her infernal final screw
Laughter masked Saturnalia
As the mallet in my linen wished her grin anew
That wicked bitch
Cruella to the bone
Each vivid stich
Just tied me to her throne
In exaltation
She built on endless lies
Mircalla, Maleresian
Architect of my despise
In exaltation
My sweet revenge presides
For I have lived through Sodom and tomorrow
And the vampyre at my side
Aching floorboards spoke my name
In the belly of the beast to foreign shores
In tune with tides that whispered fame
And fortune for our humble Lord
Ecclesiastical banners
Unfurl in the manner
Of those who seek conquest and gain
Sail forth for Outremer
The Promised Land prised from the hands
Of blasphemers amassing there
Awakened from the desert sands capes
Onward Christian soldiers
Fated Nazareth and Bethlehem
Have fallen to an enemy bolder
It is said to widespread slaughter and rape
We are all sinners, enslaved to the cross
God wills The Great War to erase
The Judaic acres, the Mohammedans
In defence of our revenant faith
Political prowess takes to the stage
A pilgrimage led bu the sword
The sweet maiden blast of our clarion rage
Against the foul heretic hordes
The blazing invader Crusader parade
Vatican sanctioned and Mammon adored
Now, papal-led to die
The fatal battle cry
A natural army vies
For stretching Christendom
Wide, we slay the infidel
Remiss our way to Hell
Pay well the wishing well
With golden martyrdom
Scaling the towers with power ordained
Dark flowers of infamy bud
Ransacking, hacking off Saracen reign
The temple drinks claret in floods
Mercy forgotten in our ill-gotten gain
Of women and innocent blood
Death abides in this domain of ashes
The streets are stained
With the butchered foe
Now I hear the bells of triumph ringing
As they lay there rotting in their thousand shrouds
Beneath the clouds
That skitter and scatter
Dispersions on the truth of heaven
We are all sinners, enslaved to the cross
God wills The Great War to erase
The Judaic acres, the Mohammedans
In defence of our revenant faith
No crescent moon
No prophet of doom
Shall wail above Jerusalem
Vast hypocrites
All grasping for glitz
Have taken The Mount and The Tomb
Here in the kingdom of loss
Solsticial
The lake is as a mirror
For the moon
That shimmers high above
The sacrificial
Lamb becoming clearer
Soon shall be
Just a shave that craved her love
Arician oaks cloak the sacred grove
Wherein her priest
Awaits to greet
His successor to this ancient throne
The King Of The Woods
Stands staunchest guard
Over the golden bough
In the eldritch haunts of Nemi where
I rake the fecund dells to take his crown
Midsummer night grows pensive
On the murder to befall
The incumbent fright defensive
Against my intense intent to rule
Divine right by the bravest slave
To perpetuate the flame
To ascend to watch blest vestals bathe
Where their temple bares Diana's name
The King Of The Woods
Cleaves the gilded tree
And accepts the sentence of the God
To rest his kindred spirit free
The Queen Of The Stars
Alights to earth
And from the silvered water's edge
She means to take me in her arms
But favours fulsome forest beds instead
Communion with heaven
The Goddess of the wild countryside
An Egeria and Virbius
We pleasure endeavour
Together we ride
I show my face, the lustrous one
And by my grace, all men undone
Fall neath my spell to fell delights
This one I chose, I froze on sight
Come sow me, mould me thy seed
So I might grow to Spring's relief
Fulfill the circle's ritual needs
Untold delights, twelve months to be
Torches draw me from this reverie
Where maids debauch me reverently
And when night dissolves, I self-absolve
Mounting my days with fate's resolve
Now
Deep in the coals of my soul
A hot tongue flickers
A reign for her flame to unfold
Before the hunt quickens Death's bow
Nightmares on a roll
The spirit of fear
Has alighted here
Mercy on your soul...
This fright, crepuscular
Is muscular with vitriol
I pass by as your shadow
The ghostly burning arrow
A marksman for your swerving heart
I support your faith
When weary, in disgrace
You fall to doubt and pull all life apart
On this mist-enshrouded pathway
And through this hateful tarantella
In this thin labyrinth of razors
I shall grin, your soul's propeller
Respite from the grief
These spiteful nightfall teeth
Grinding minds to tiny pieces
Clockwork works the thief
Like an ever-ticking beast
Whose biting cogs self-denial greases
Drowned in alcohol
Sirens of the deep
Are demon forces
Mercy on your soul...
A life lived more monastic
Drastic measures must extol
On this mist-enshrouded pathway
And through this hateful tarantella
In this thin labyrinth of razors
I shall win, your soul's propeller
Bound to you like bloodline
Familiar with the cracks
The foul and fetid landscape
Just off the beaten tracks
Broods treacherous with sinkholes
The moon is doused in tar
And the fiend disaster preys upon
This straight and narrow path
Like an ever-ticking beast
Whose biting cogs self-denial greases
I free you of the bond
To pain, now flee beyond
The veil of Death
Where peace holds reign
I'm the killing stroke
The dagger in your throat
Under the armour
Calmer with its gain
Enemies take control
The swarming hordes
Have stormed the walls
Mercy on your soul...
Tonight I close your eyes
Before the temple falls
Before the temple falls
Weak midnight promises of love,
were wept upon her grave and shunned by stars above.
In mortal life lurks my dismay.
An Angel stole my heart and Death took her away.
She sleeps beyond the grace of God,
a dreaming beauty.
If wishes could only fray that bond,
the dead would sing for me.
Twelfth moon arose with ghostly voice,
a poet's serenade.
Her name a whisper upon my lips and lo,
Rorasa came!
Fear me not my grieving king,
funereal in breath.
The secrets of the dark I know,
and thus, we shall cheat Death.
My promises wrought though despondence that night,
have delivered me gifts from the grave.
Rorasa enshadowed and eternal life,
never a Devil so vain.
The Angel is fallen, for I thought her lost,
and no heaven would silence the pain.
Teach me these secrets, the sensual frost,
desire for warm blood again.
Dark nature clasp my soul,
around her throat mine arms enfold.
To sleep, perchance to dream,
and then to dusk and flesh ascend.
The sun descends, magenta spirits fill the skies,
and wreak erotic maladies where sex and Death abide.
From writhing tides where gothick siren weave their song to shore.
Through the ashes of the battlefields where ravens and angels war.
As phantoms we have fled the basilisk of day,
to rise as phoenix taloned, nightly taking prey.
We rule like the red and risen moon upon the sea.
The stars of judgement silent, for we share joyous eternity.
Damnation!
Salvation!
Stigmata plague!
The wine of Bacchus flows.
Listen to the thunder rage!
Deceivers dragged before their cross!
I am he that vanquished Death and bore the sting of loss.
What vulgar Christ will unprise my grasp?
His temple, ruined, burns and sweet Rorasa laughs.
I am enamoured and imparadised,
to catch the fires dancing profanely in her eyes.
I will crush them all if this holds thy delight.
Rather dead forever than to lose her.
Rise crepuscular
Devildom voyeurs
Rise towards the light
Nascent aeons confer
The noose of revelation
Tightens upon misdeed
And the serpent of truth
Eats the nomad destiny
Vast shadows gather
In penumbral reign
Blind masses bring the jury of chaos
Poised to sodomize the human world back
Supernal curtains hang tattered
As others feast on the loss of command
Vengeance climbs Babel's ivory tower
Masturbated by a Cretan priestess
Victory spent
Breathe deep benighted scent
Seething fever demons gnaw in me
Like the tugging of my veins to feed
From sweet flowing waters of divinity
Millenniums turned black....
Attack!
Pour out our rages on those despised
Vulgar religion of the skies
Storm the citadels aloof upon the clouds
Erasing jealousies beneath eternal shrouds
Come lift thine eyes bedizened with delight
The fifth epoch is ours!
Artemis
Spread the lust of the dark Fantasia
Celebrate, renew the grave
The infidel soon unmasks her face
A crescent moon waxing forevermore
Sharpened to skewer dawn....
I am as a plague born unto darkness
The secret amour of an archangel's rape
A casualty when my mother, possessed
Cursed at the stake
Attack!
Pour out thy rages on those despised
Vulgar religion of the skies
Storm citadels aloof upon the clouds
We're erasing jealousies beneath eternal shrouds
Come lift thine eyes bedizened with delight
The fifth epoch is ours!
The most asplendid sorcerers of Hades
Darkly seized for me a throne
And the upraised scythe so terribly scribed
vengeance in Jesuit blood on stone
From this ransacked celestial temple
I hold the prophet's severed head unto all nations
Tremble before us
Lords of the star-veiled red sepulchres
Rushing deathwards, our Tartarean fires
Kindle pandemonia to furnace the earth
Our voices are opened graves,
Through which the never-dead escape
From deep abyssic dream
Pursuing ascendancy....
The noose of revelation
Tightens upon misdeed
And the serpent of truth
Eats the nomad destiny
Vast shadows gather
In penumbral reign
Blind masses bring the jury of chaos
Poised to sodomize the human world back
Supernal curtains hang tattered
As others feast on the loss of command
Vengeance climbs Babel's ivory tower
Masturbated by a Cretan priestess
The enemy has held three seasons
Imparadised, whilst we writhed
To psycho-dramas penned by aerial decree
Now freed to plunder....
Heaven torn asunder
When the moonlight sleeps upon the waveless lake
And the mists steal in with ease
The children of the night may sing
But I will call to thee
I will call to thee
Encroaching evening skies die with such tragedy
And the dead in their graves dwell on pleasures to be
In deepes Styria where our legend still breathes
Thou has murmured my name as the wind through the trees
And I will come, as if in dream
My languid, dark and lustrous Malaresian Queen,
Of noble love fatale
An eager guillotine
Erishkigal, raven-haired
Thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
I know thy scent by candlelight
Immortal flesh I yearn to share
Excite my greed on spattered sheets
Dyed unearthly red as sobriety weeps
Nocternity.... She shall come for me
A black velvet painting sprung to elegant life
Like a poignant Madonna perverted to night
And I have ridden from the westerning light
To expend my lust
Tear away the funereal dress
Know that I will escape from my death
Surrendered to the splendour of her sharpened caress
The pale moonlight
Weaves a poetic spell of vital death and decline
Of mist and moth and the hunger inside
Kisses took to fever and the fever, demise
Through twilight, darkness and moonrise
My scarlet tears will run
As stolen blood and whispered love
Of fantasies undone
Countess swathed in ebony
And snow-white balletic grace
Ruby lips procure the wish
For dusk and her embrace
Dusk and her embrace
We shall flit through the shadows,
Like a dream of werewolves in the snow
Consumed with ardour
A romance that ever unfolds
Beneath the stars death bedevils me
Beneath the stars taste the death in me
Evil is a fiery wish to sever thin mortality
The candlelight flickers
Under the deadly nightshade
Together insane
Screaming through nails of pain
Elizabeth
My heart is thine
Thy fragrant words
Warm within like wine....
Sexual dusk allure
With asphodel eyes
Moon-glancing maleficia
Enflame the tides
And I will come, as if in dream
My languid, dark and lustrous Malaresian Queen,
Of noble love fatale
An eager guillotine
Thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
I know thy scent by candlelight
Immortal flesh I yearn to share
Excite my greed on spattered sheets
Dyed unearthly red as sobriety weeps
Nocternity, She shall come for me....
Unfurl thy limbs breathless succubus
The full ebmossomed fog
Imparts the night to us....
Evening minuetto in a castle by the sea
A jewel more precious than the moon
lowered Her mask to me.
The sublimest creature the God of desire
Would dream about making his Queen
Drowning the air with Promethean Fire
And my heart burned with dark poetry
I fell in love with Her
Scent and feline lure,
And woodland eyes, that ushered in the impurest
Erotic, laden fantasies amid this warm Autumn night
I lulled her away from the rich masquerade
And together we kissed in the bloodletting moonlight
Oh Luna, what spell didst thou cast on me?
Her icy kiss fervoured my neck
Like whispering waves upon Acheron's beach.
In a whirl of dark voices and statues
That phantomed the dying trees.
This debauched seducer in black, loved me....
In a pale azured dawn like Ligeia reborn
I woke free of my sleep-sepulchre
On the sea misted lawn where stone figures, forlorn
Lamented the spectre of her
Bewildered and weak, yet with passion replete
I longed for the past overtures
The curse of unrest and her lingered caress
Seemed much more than my soul could endure....
I at once endeavoured to see her again
Lest my heart came palsied
Without even mouthing her name
On a thin precipice over carnal abyss
I danced like a blind acolyte
Drunk on red wine, her dead lips on mine
Suffused with the perfume of night
For hours I scoured the castle grounds
In vain for us to meet
When storm clouds broke, ashened, fatigued
I sought refuge in a cemetery
Sleep, usher dreams
Taint to nightmares from a sunless nether
Mistress of the dark
I now know what thou art
Screams haunt my sleep
dragged from nightmares thou hast wed together
Lamia and Lemures
Spawned thee leche
To snare my flesh
Portrait of the Dead Countess
Deep stained pain that I had dreamt
Flaunted Death's cold punishment
Leaving strength to seal this
Wretched tom
But poised nectar within my stirs
Up feverous desire and morbid purpose to search
Through cobwebbed drapery to where she swoons
Goddess of the graveyard, of the tempest and moon
In flawless fatal beauty her very visage compels
Glimpses of a heaven where ghost company fell
To mourning the loss of God in blackest velvet
Enrobed in their downfall like a swift silhouette
Fleeting, enshadowed
Thou art privy to my sin
Secrets dead, wouldst thou inflict
The cruel daylights upon my skin?
Dost thou not want to worship me
With crimson sacrifice
So my cunt may twitch against thy kiss
And weep with new-found life?
My realm in dusk
Torn to her embrace
Dark angels taste my tears
And whisper haunting requiems
Softly to mine ear
Need-fires have lured abominations here....
Nocturnal pulse
My veins spill forth their water
Rent by lips I cherish most
Awash on her perfidious shores
Where drowning shadows o'er the stars
Ebon's graves where lovers whore
Pluck out mine eyes, hasten, attest
Blind reason against thee, Enchantress
For I must know, art thou not death?
My heart echoes bloodless and incensed....
Doth temptation prowl the earth seducing the weak
Did not the Queen of Heaven come as Devil to me?
On that fatal Hallow's Eve when we fled company
as the music swept around us in the crisp, fallen leaves
Under horned Diana where her bloodline was sewn
In a graveyard of Angels rent in cool marbled stone
I am grieving the loss of life in sombre velvet
Enrobed in Death's shadow like a swifter silhouette....
Candelabra snuffed prey, silhouette wedded
Nightfall, take my hand
Seduce me with silky timbred limbs
Grant me thy dark command
Over the peaks framing tapestries
Of thick forest, dusk has filled
With Lucifugous kisses enwreathed in mist
Creeping surreptitiously to kill
Lucretia, I drain thy veins
Thy tears are sweeter than the mountain rain
Bewinged, infested belfries
Toll over the sobbing throng
A writhe of lethargic, terrored nudes
Dance to my tortuous song
I am He
The crowned and conquering darkness
Satan robed in ecumenical filth
Livid Bacchus sustained by bridal echelons of sylph
This wintry eve when the snow lies deep
And jagged ramparts wed the moonlit sky
I shrug off the shroud of preternatural sleep
Embroidered by these words Malaresia scribed....
Beauty slept and angels wept
For her immortal soul
In this repose, these Devils chose
To claim her for their very own
Carpathia
The dead shall speak of her
In graveyard tongue where pack wolves run
Blood red mist seeps across the sun
Never leave me....
This wintry night when awed stars report
Their absence from the heavenly brow
Crippled seraph shalt cower in illustrious courts
Whilst the cloaked maelstrom resounds
How the storm it fulfills,
My heart though unhealed
Celestial knifes ebonied
And wild woods thrill
Yet far fiercer still,
Her lustre encompassing me
Carpathia
Nature has long incurred
The trees to weave the cold fog like thread
Across the path the righteous tread
I rule as Master here
Where cruel winds impart my temper
Love sank wounded when I, betrayed
Saw Death etch cruelly, upon my lineage
Arise panthered Draconis
And commit this world to thy ancient sovereignty
Erubescent veil descend
Eclipse without an end
And legacies blessed with darkness
Forever more
Supreme vampiric evil
This wintry eve when the snow lies deep
And jagged ramparts wed the moonlit sky
I shrug off the shroud of preternatural sleep
Embroidered by these words Malaresia scribed....
Beauty slept and angels wept
For her immortal soul
In this repose, these Devils chose
To claim her for their very own
Carpathia
The dead still speak of her
In graveyard tongue where wolf packs run
Blood red mist sweeps across the sun
Candelabra snuffed prey, silhouette wedded
Nightfall, take my hand
Seduce me with silky timbred limbs
Grant me thy dark command
Over the peaks framing tapestries
Of thick forest, dusk has filled
With Lucifugous kisses enwreathed in mist
Creeping surreptitiously to kill
Death, spirit me away
My anguished soul doth strain
On taut and twisted reins
Yet, insatiate I remain
A proud, unfallen star
That dares thee from afar
To calm my thund'rous heart
Yet rend it's knot apart
So I may never sing
Of red skies o'er my strings
And love, a wanton thing
Can plunge on burnt, black wings
To hang amid the thorns
Scarlet like velvet worn
About the cloud-wracked moon
Who wanes in solitude....
I am alone
Thirsting for the dark
That breathes beneath the stone
What black witchcraft
Shall cast me from thy dreams
And what perverse world-strategy
Will crawl with thee from sleep?
Rouse my disease
And with cadent naked dance I shalt teach
Thee wisdom of darkness
From earth and red sea
Lightbearing Samael
Coalesce with me....
Twilight
Through frosted gates
Entwining shadows of the snake
By candlelight
Thanateros rites
Death seduced and chaos wakes
Obsession grips, blindragon fever
In throes of scythed orgasm, Eros dies
And Saturn rapes faith's lovelorn Diva
Upon a cyprean altar
Stripped bare for sacrifice
Virtue births a demon
Pandora's box, unhinged, sets loose the night
Winged Lilith born for want of Eden
Fanning plumes of harlotry
Like pearls before the desert swine
In time, the oceans parts
Storm as a Kraken
Reborn Venus as thou art
Feeding at my banquet
Of Saturnalia.
I call thee having wrestled
The tides from lonely Diana
For thee Endymion,
I forsake the cerements
Of this star-flung tomb
Be-with-us, come
Unveil the ancient flame
Throw the cats our enemies
Desire's menstrual strain
Eastern Devil eyes
A cruel erotic plague
The Shekhina is in exile
And the Israelites.... enslaved
Midnight
Jerusalem
A tenebrous phantasy
Revelates to men
Their celestial walls crumble
When walks the Xul
Born to the scarlet whore in Babylon
Herodias and I have led a phantom cavalcade
Through veiled romantic history where superstitions reigned
And Christendom sought to pervert, but poets of my name
Sang of penumbral victories that sorcery had claimed
The Graal and mighty Caliburn as votive offerings
To an England rearisen under vast prophetic wings
These are the shores where to my soul
Blood-drenched and unredeemed
Shalt seek solace in secrets told
And tranquil as a dream
From the woods Pendragon-born, I rose Arcturius
A proud and mighty king robed in the chivalry of lust
Death and fate undaunted me, I drew a throne divided
Glorious the battles won Black Adraste provided
Then treachery, a wingless beast, came crawling to my court
And now I lie at cursed Camlann, from wounds a traitor wrought
From wounds a traitor wrought....
I fear the Augean light is gutting Camelot
How bittersweet my triumphs seem
Now Autumnal dreams succumb to frost
Morganna art thou near me?
My strength wilts near a grave
Cast my sword to the sylphid grasp
Of the Naiad beneath the silvered lake
When waters stirred lay silent
Mistress let the mists descend
Thy tears cannot thaw Death's cold heart
His sombre gaze defies legend
More so than thine lest thy dew-lidded eyes
Art for the Banshee's song.
Or our souls entwined like vein upon
The haunted shores of Avalon
I greet thee Dark Immortals
On this isle 'neath the moon
Why hast our kingdom fallen
To the enemy so soon
Let loose the hounds of darksome night
To pillage, plague and burn
As slumber lures me 'mongst the dead
To scheme of my return
Archaic ghostly echoes breathe like thunder of the storm
A tempest fools miscall divine as they crouch awaiting dawn
Their ignorance has forged for me over centuries a sword
Burnished to flash like lightning on the precipice of war
The wolves are dead in Albion whilst the passive flocks roam free
Thus my penetrant spearhead shalt pierce these foul trespassing breeds
These are the shores where to my soul
Blood drenched and unredeemed
Shalt seek solace in secrets told
And tranquil as a dream
I have awoken from the past
Lenghening the shadows
Over England's bitter scars
I prize wide the wounds
Her soils whetted, drink
Remember me as king
When I cradle elder stars
Like lovers in my arms
Nestled vipers to my breast
Venomed forces work these cards
Of Devils and priestess....
Thus I shall rule anew
Through sinews of a song
Played upon a storm
By the ghosts of Avalon
And all in league will bow to me
From death they shall ascend
To whisper winds of war to stir
The dark-one-thing in men
Evening minuetto in a castle by the sea

Meaningless
Is this all there is
A flicker of life in a black forever?
Shine a light on the bowels of Heaven
Dark futures howl in her grip
Frightening new constellations, headlong
Press their scowls on Orion's lip
Our earth is strangled
From within and soon without
Existential terror
Four Horsemen our pall bearers
Riding nightmares of purebred belief
In the coming apocalypse
Existential terror
Furies spit on grave endeavours
The world is a slippery reef
Encircled by beasts of the sea
beneath an eclipse
The more we know, all the more we quiver
On our knees before prophecies
Just begun or being sung for countless centuries
Psalms carved deep into our psyches
Our earth, newfangled
Abrim with sin and fully undevout
Existential terror
Four Horsemen our pall bearers
Riding nightmares of purebred belief
In the coming apocalypse
Existential terror
Bleak winds blow storm-crow scarers
The world is a slippery reef
Encircled by beasts of the wing
beneath an eclipse
A gnawing fear of death
Of the great beyond
Of the lessening bells of midnights left
To dwell upon what the hell went wrong
A perverse, reverse Pentecost
Mass cataclysm, all is lost
Accursed music of the spheres
Ascends to score a bitter ending here
Existential terror
Pestilential errors fly
In the face of planetary strife
Existential terror
Four Horsemen our pall bearers
Riding nightmares of purebred belief
In our extermination
Decide
Eyes scour blazing skies
Time to embrace the inevitable
We are all going to fucking die
Lovecraft the day
Bend it to Wyrd ways
Life wends, a masquerade
Where nothing is forever
Save the grave
And our desire burning
Look about us now, unbowed
The world is furled in tragedy
And outed from the madding crowd
Hurdles bless our destiny
When the moon is full
And the wolves howl in the forest
Would you take my hand
And lead us both on our dark adventure?
Would we share our dreams
Those necromantic fantasies?
So could we ever be
Apart, when our hearts align like thunder?
Do what thou wilt
Never got their guilt
Death purrs with a sombre lilt
Precious hours
As sylph and Filth
Are built on borrowed time
So let us fly
Twin spirits joined as one inside
As countless devils hone damnation
We shall revel in our own salvation
Before we die
Before high judgement comes crashing nigh
Let's seat our fates together
On the throne of paradise
My soul was caricature, rest assured
It hobbled cold and lame
Then across my defenses of frost
You came, eyes full of flame
So when the stars spill out
And the nights are filled with terror
Will you whisper truth
Right us from their human error?
Would we share our dreams
Those necromantic fantasies?
So could we ever be
Apart, when our hearts align like thunder?
Love conquers all, love conquered me
It put the Magdalen on her knees
So breathe the magic in the air
Tragic tastes sit everywhere
As heavens fix their wrathful eye
On man licking the planet dry
Of leavened tears, lets you and
I just spread our wings...
When the moon is full
And the wolves howl in the forest
Would you take my hand
And lead us both on our final voyage?
Would we share our dreams
Those necromantic fantasies?
Really, could we ever be
Apart, when our hearts lie six feet under?
Ravaged are the heavens
Seven angels are deployed
The seals delivered
To return us to the void
And waiting on the cusp of many dusks of man
He watches as the masses seek a fake salvation
As He breeds annihilation
Now death is law
Venom dripping from the mouth of madness
Incites the rites of war
Prepare the heights of Empire for the agonising fall
The beast is rising
Enwreathed in flame
The soundtrack bleeds insanity
His theme, the screaming End Of Days
Come
Crawling King Chaos, come
Sing his name in rapture, wormwood bitter, spat in tongues
Of ancient Pandemonia for the ghosts all shall become
Returning to the churning of primordial seas
The Order Of Disorder restored through tribulation
Through this bred annihilation
The whole world is his church now
A seismic paradigm shift to chaos
Be the prophet's propaganda
The beast is rising
A cancer at the core
Of everything accelerating
To Death's apathetic maw
The beast is rising
Underlit by gore
Stone tablets crack, humanity
Is doomed to looming horror score
Scatter brittle insects, fate is heard
In the necrotic birth
Of the terminus plague
Satan has fallen
Midst dark waters of the Earth
Come
Crawling King Chaos, come
Mountains heave great murmurs
Fires raze the forests black
As billions flee the horsemen
Creation, wounded, staggers back
To expire in the mire, wiped from all of time
It will be eternally that we never existed
By this bred annihilation
Be the prophet's propaganda
The beast has risen
Behind the sun
The least unleashed is Armageddon
For everything and everyone
The beast has risen
Tearing wide the door
For our burning footprint
On a cindered world, sinning no more
A cindered world, sinning no more
Drunk off the wine of her mass fornication
She sits astride turbulent seas
Her poisoned cunt harbor to deep fascination
Nations in thrall to the Great Harlot Babylon
She is desire
Free, swathed in dark ecstasies
She will not tire
Bathe in her fire, the Great Harlot Babylon
I have loved her stars too deliciously
To be fearful of the consequences
Judgements, hellbent
On vengeful wing
Descend to swell her cemeteries
Her orchids unfurl as bureaucracy moulders
Sweet opiates further the dream
The fate of the world on her silk-caressed shoulders
Scarlet this woman, the Great Harlot Babylon
She breeds acceptance
Of greed and hypocrisy
Decreed is the sentence
Her prophetic downfall
Unheeded by everyone
I have drunk of her fruits too viciously
To turn my face from her desecration
From foreign shores come the claws to rend her
To burn it all, this opulent splendor
And cast her down in naked surrender
Back to the spurn of the fall
The sins of the earth have spread out her vines
Eastern at birth, now she westers the vespertine
Festers and shines there
The scent of her fragrances hung like a noose
Upon Eden's forbidden tree
The Mother Of Exile, beguiling and loose
Tongued like a serpent, the Great Harlot Babylon
She is desire
Free, swathed in grave liberties
She will not tire
Bathe in her fire, the Great Harlot Babylon
Her putrescence blazes, deep mystery Babylon
And though the skies
In tumult, agonise
She still swaggers in the shadow
Of the towers aimed at God
Black smoke curling from the lips of warfare
Black smoke curling from the lips of war
See, false cathedral
She feeds this evil
Regime with the fecal
So flee from her, people
For freed, the primeval
Will bleed her steeples dry in every way
Idolatress, Ishtar, mistress
Shalt suffer a painful, shameful death
Her soul disgorged
And then be left with nothingness
I look back on the books of my life I've written so well
Father I fell
Farther I fell
For coveted girls and the sins that follow them
I have loved and laughed enough for half a battalion of foes
But nobody knows of my inner demeanour but thee
Nightmares
Slink in their dark lairs
Thinking of plots where
Everything rings with the sting of depravity
As thou have seen I have not always danced on the edge of the world
I have oft lost my mind
In labyrinths, blind
And broken my bread with the flies
I just don't want to die
Without thee by my side
Sated and beautiful
I will struggle with keys at the gate
Never a saint, far from decency's grace
True to my heart
Bearing off-the-chart latitudes
Father I fell
Farther I fell
A reckless Rakehell with misdeeds that still honour me
I see now that beauty held me mesmerised under a spell
Father I fell
Farther I fell
Down slick mythic wells
Where emptiness swallowed me
I have lived and gasped enough
For more than ten thousand shadows
But nobody knows of my innermost demons but thee
Nightmares
Slink in their dark lairs
Eyes are aflame there
Waiting to sink their despicable teeth into me
As thou have seen I have not always danced on the edge of the world
I have succoured and fought
Like a fucker for naught
But the right to be left to my dreams
Finally soul I am free
Joyously thralled to recalled memories of yore
So before I pass I must see thee if only once more
Oh my beautiful friend
I will love thee until the end is nigh
And in time
I'll find thee in my arms on the vast other side
Father I fell
I look back on the books of my life
I've written so well
Father I fell
Farther I fell, a reckless Rakehell
With misdeeds that still honour me
I see now that beauty held me mesmerised under a spell
Father I fell
Farther I fell, down slick mythic wells
Where emptiness swallowed me
Bloodstains, not rose petals lie on the path
To the gluttonous bed of the whore
For she, who is Satan, the waiting bloodbath
Is preparing her nation's for war
For war!
Anthropogenic
Dark angels wring
The fabric of life free of tears
Choking black fronds
From the censers they bring
Encircle as Apocalypse nears
Midnight is the phase
Seismic second waves
End of final days near
Sorrowed Holocene
Blackened back to clean
Like Man has never been here
Nothing but burnt
Skies ever learnt
The fate of that terrible game
It is not this stirred circus
Strength that deserts us
Fires that hurt us
But the dying of the embers
That murders all hope for the flame
For the ghost of humanity to rise once again
Unsympathetic judgement descends
Nine billion souls under heel
Storm-clouds ablaze, razors slice through the ends
Of the Earth, with insatiable zeal
Midnight is the phase
Seismic second waves
End of final days near
Sorrowed Holocene
Blackened back to clean
Like Man has never been here
Nothing but burnt skies ever learnt
The fate of that terrible game
It is not this stirred circus
Strength that deserts us
Fires that hurt us, that brings on the pain
Nothing but burnt
Skies ever learnt
The fate of that terrible game
It is not this stirred circus
Strength that deserts us
Fires that hurt us
But the dying of the embers
That murders all hope for the flame
Our lengthening reach went astray
Ignoring the laws of our brittle existence, the universe clawed
And tore it away
Life is a dream
In an endless charade
Armageddon deadens
History warned us but we chose to pray
We murdered all hope for the flame
For the ghost of humanity to rise once again
Nothing but burnt
Skies ever learnt
The fate of that terrible game
It is not this stirred circus
Strength that deserts us
Fires that hurt us, that brings on the pain
Nothing but burnt
Skies ever learnt
The fate of that terrible game
It is not this stirred circus
Strength that deserts us
Fires that hurt us
But the dying of the embers
That murders all hope for the flame
Our time together ends
The sadness is over
I tried my best to make amends
But my heart grew cold and black
I have knelt before your altar
Read the missives from your psalters
In many ways, I was bound to falter
You gave me nothing back
Religious fervour got us no further
The Goddess silent to the zealots that serve her
Veneration, masturbation
Icons of deceit built on fluidic foundations
I'd have offered you the world from an elven spire
These thoughts shall not prevail
For in our time, the ships had set sail
Disguise the hurt with wine and fire
How many tears to nurture a rose?
How many thorns to tear us both into pieces?
The night, the night grew chill
And in its arms, I fantasized
And fell into her darksome eyes
I woke upon the sand
The madness was over
I tried my best to understand
But my mind, bewitched, was gone
I had crawled within her garden
Seen the things that would make a soul harden
Saints and sinners all begging her pardon
I had hung upon her cross
The taste of bliss turned to venomous piss
Now the graven angels sing of loss
I'd have offered you the world from an elven spire
These thoughts shall not prevail
For in our time, the ships had set sail
Disguise the hurt with wine and fire
How many tears to nurture a rose?
How many thorns to tear us both into pieces?
Faith bled away from the shore that day
Nothing but the whispers of the vista at play
Advanced, answered my
Lonely prayers, my spent libations
Thunder coming with a pent frustration
You could have been my esteemed salvation
And we'd have had it all
If you'd only stepped from your pedestal
I'd have offered you the world from an elven spire
These thoughts shall not prevail
For in our time, the ships had set sail
Disguise the hurt with wine and fire
How many tears to nurture a rose?
How many thorns to tear us both into pieces?
The ability to sustain life on earth is shrinking
In perfect unison with rising population
Soon, half of all species will be lost to climate change
And ecological collapse due to human activity
Thus we either reduce our race voluntarily
Or nature will do it for us
And she will be fucking brutal
A grave infection killing its beautiful host
Destroying precious habitats
Acidifying seas, raising the ghost
Exhausting resources
Retaking Eden back
Inhumankind now drives mass extinction
No escape from an enemy of billions
Pity the poor creatures that suffer our dominion
Nowhere left to live unhindered
The Angel of Death slips through the creaking eaves
Everywhere we touch polluted
Greed sits across the table, suited
Welting Mother Gaia like a rash
Bow to our domination
Last belts of nature 'neath the lash
We need to bleed
To devour all creation
Feed the masters
Vast abattoirs existing for our prey
Breeding disaster
Naive consumption
Forefront of the coming plagues
The end descends on all with no distinction
Omnicide, Theriocide the final curtain
Cataclysm close to midnight, that is certain
Inhumankind now drives mass extinction
No escape from an enemy of billions
Pity the poor creatures that suffer our dominion
Suffer our dominion
We are currently consuming natural resources
At almost twice the rate the planet can renew them
Thus to restore the balance, nature will retaliate
But it will be no subtle pruning of our luxuries
It will be a cruel and merciless catastrophe on a global scale
And without doubt
It will be the end of life as we know it
A simple fact, vast errors weigh
Thus Terra acts to curb our play
A coffin for the world handmade to measure
From forests' twisted treasures
Now lost to frost forever
The end has come
Jungles culled, sold on or cindered
The Angel of Death slips through the burning leaves
Everywhere we touch polluted
Trees of wisdom long since rooted
Inhumankind now drives mass extinction
No escape from an enemy of billions
Pity the poor creatures that suffer our dominion
No escape from an enemy of billions
Pity the poor fuckers that suffer our dominion
No escape, no escape, no escape, no escape, no escape, no escape
So pity the poor creatures that suffer our dominion
Us, dark, invincible
Us, dark, invincible
Seize the night
Before the fevers take flight
Cicadas drown out delight
In this horny cornucopia
The stars are alight
We have desires in sight
Dark immortals, bedight
In the throes of lycanthropia
Drink deep when dusk descends
The moon-kissed air
That succours...
Us, dark, invincible
Us, dark, invincible
We know our sins appall
Us, dark, invincible
Us, dark, invincible
We know our sins appall
We, the children of The Fall
Dripping with gall
The gothic-scarred principle
Our balustrades standing tall
Us, dark, invincible
Freeze the day
Let our nocturnal foray
Keep Aurora at bay
From this candlelit utopia
As orchestras play
Nightmares speak of the way
We're painting over the grey
In a dripping red sinopia
Bursting with flame
Seasoned teeth, never tame
We're first in whispered disdain
Icons for their nyctophobia
We suitor ill winds
Incalculable sins
The face of vanity grins
At our human race ectopia
Drink deep when dusk descends
The moon-kissed air
That succours...
Us, dark, invincible
Us, dark, invincible
We know our sins appall
Us, dark, invincible
Us, dark, invincible
We know our sins appall
We, the children of the fall
Dripping with gall
The gothic-scarred principle
Our balustrades standing tall
Us, dark, invincible
Us, dark, invincible
What fires die
In the hearts of those awry?
And what mad embers arise
In the veins of the insatiable?
What dreams might fly
Through the mist and midnight skies
When our cold souls fantasise
On the warmth of walls now scaleable?
Never
Never will we break the vows
We took when we swore to the dark
Never will the shadows bow
On the house of our ancient caste
Never
Never will their rule renew
For when the Day Of Reckoning is over
I'll bring their severed heads to you
Witching hourglasses
Bleed the hissing sands of time
As this story, gory, a catharsis
Leads toward the quite sublime
We have such sights to show you
Enslaved from the start
She captured my heart
I recall our lips trembled a whisper apart
And when she died
I cried to darkened orders
Fell fiends of the abyss
Beware their kiss
Sisters of the mist
Through split lips of torture
I scream out her name
Clarissa, I miss her
Death's fissure remains
She hangs in the courtyard
Neath a cold, callous moon
Her bruised naked carcass
Displayed for the boon
Of those who desired her
Fiery womb
If tomorrow we burn
Tonight we will seal their doom
Enslaved from the start
She captured my heart
I recall our lips trembled a whisper apart
So when she died
I cried in darkened corners
Fell fiends of the abyss
Beware their kiss
Sisters of the mist
As guards drunkenly slept, fog crept from dank woods
Slithering, slathering, beasts understood
That starved, vengeful spirits of similar fates
Had answered the prayers I left at their cemetery gates
From the scarred side of midnight
Monstrosities came
Clarissa, I wished
For hellfire to rain
These vehement women
Lithe Stygian shades
Tore through the murk
Like a forest of razorblades
Fating, castrating
Each soul to be taken
And freed from my cell
On reaching the gallows
Enshadowed, I fell
Witching hourglasses
Bleed the hissing sands within
As the net of retribution passes
Leaving nothing breathing in its skin
A waste of good suffering
The coven dispel with the first rites of dawn
Sated they fade, now benign
I cut down my bride and cry out, forlorn
Cradling her spent body to mine
Then for one rent moment
A miracle spurred from the pain
Death lends her back to my fervent embrace
Three final words as she slips to oblivion
Enslaved from the start
She captured my heart
I recall our lips trembled a whisper apart
And when she died
I cried on darkened shores
Despisal, reprisal for holy fists
Beware their Mephistory
Sisters of the mist
Sisters of the mist
Now the sun rises on streets steeped in blood
I stagger her corpse to the lake
The feared Water Wyrds creature up from the mud
To take us to depths far away from the stake
As the cold waves enclose, I shall falter no more
Nothing is ghosting me back to the shore
And though I have knelt at this altar before
Death will unite us, our nights will be glorious
Together, victorious
And legendary, even in hell
I have basked like a phantom in shadow
Haunting gauntest opera eaves
As the cast was aware of nothing more in the air
Than the whisper of snow on the Autumnal breeze
As the ignorant waltzed
The ballad changed it's melody
Shunning the sun for infernal gloom
I felt joy in deep misery
But fate's found me out by the plight of the moon
Blazing a path that laughed at my own ill-ease
Drown despair with molten deeds
Fell the beast before it feeds
Master the sacred
Blast the horns that razed cities
Tell the grating world upon its knees
That I am free
This tethered Hellcat is unleashed
Unwinding, sore
Grinding to the core
This fucking Hellion is unleashed
The feeling is back like a Pharaonic curse
The scent of fresh blood to a ravenous thirst
Lazarus risen, brought back from the dead
Realisation, this seasoning dread
Adrift in the cosmos, naked and rife
We breed without meaning
Gifted with fleeting life
Drown despair with molten deeds
Fell the beast before it feeds
Master the sacred
Blast the horns that razed cities
Tell the grating world upon its knees
That I am free
The gates of the mind splinter open wide
On rusted hinges, must infringes
Senses thrust to override
Explode upon reality, I thought long-lost, I failed to see
The forest for the trees
My fire had fled and died
I now behold a dawn adorned with majesty
To never dare embrace it would be a travesty
A seething Chaotopia, a bedlam time story
For, if this is the end
I want my wretched scars to breathe
Now sinkholes spit me back
The shades retreat like scattered dogs
As the earth is ablaze with the end of days
I watch the palaces burn along with gods
Portals of thought have delivered me
From the brink of a stinking abyss
Wherein the view was of pain and askew
With an apathy born of crisis
Existential, for our place in the spheres
Gleamed meaningless, I must confide
I suffered, a fool at the mercy of fear
For what good was living when dying inside?
Drown despair with molten deeds
Fell the beast before it feeds
Master the sacred
Blast the horns that razed cities
Tell the grating world upon its knees
That I am free
This tethered Hellcat is unleashed
Unwinding, sore
Grinding to the core
This fucking Hellion is upon them
Ride to the land of secrets.

In every funeral, I have been

I am the Destroyer of Life, I hear you chanting for me.
A Great Mass... of Death
A Great Mass of Death

Dogs on the run,
foam on their mouths
The scavengers approaching as they run from the netherworld
Savages, erosive, massive are the jaws of oblivion
In your dreams you hear a name
Was it yours? Is it reclaimed?
Autumn comes to claim the old
You forget the past painted by you
And you sink,
You can’t breathe
I an ocean of grey
memories fade
And you lose
All you’ve gained
All your triumphs in vain
black thoughts remain
Bury your name,
Forget your face.
Time, out of place.
Oceans of grey
All of your joy,
All of your pain
Emotions drained.
Oceans of Grey.
Dogs on the run,
foam on their mouths
The scavengers approaching as they run from the netherworld
Savages, erosive, massive are the jaws of oblivion
Solid earth is now dissolved.
Water fills your empty world.
And you sink,
You can’t breathe
I an ocean of grey
memories fade
And you lose
All you’ve gained
All your triumphs in vain
black thoughts remain
Bury your name,
Forget your face.
Oceans of grey
Dreaming...
I had the strangest dream...
Something that still is haunting me.
Dreaming...
A ray escaped my window blinds, a carrier of the morning light.
I opened my eyes.
My clock was keeping time.
It was another normal day
I thought I was awake.
Dreaming...
The Undead Keep Dreaming
My face! When I looked at the mirror,
I felt something was wrong.
A strange thought in my head
Am I really awake?
The Undead Keep Dreaming
I found myself again in bed confused by what occurred
And everything as usual just seemed to be in place.
But when I questioned what I felt, in front the mirror black,
The comfort of the morning light was stolen from my heart.
In agony I tried to leave this dream and just awake,
But on and on I found myself returning in my bed.
I lost the count of times I tried and failed to reach the day
And even now I am not sure if I am here awake.
The Undead Keep Dreaming...
Long ago I swore an oath to levitate my soul
Above the things that seal me,
Those trying to deceive me.
I fought on psychic wars, the raids of mind control.
I closed my ears to sirens,
Their song I killed with silence.
On fields of mist, with thoughts from gold
I am rising as a Sun.
Destiny, Victory., are giving me their wings.
Not gone... I am still alive,
Through Will and strong desire. I am rising!
I fought on many wars and bled and cried and lost.
But I kept fighting on, until I reached my goal.
Destiny, Victory, have healed my broken wings.
Not gone... I am still alive,
Through Will and strong desire.
Why is obtaining knowledge a reason for punishment?
Stupidity is definitely not an option for the truly powerful leader.
Who is leading who and to what end?
Why has revelation of truth been connected
with the sense of great awe and great disaster?
Mankind desperately needs someone else to clean up
its mess and a scapegoat to blame for its own faults.
Is human a parasitic organism on the body of earth?
Is this the horrid truth that will be realised at the point of no return?
When a parasite sucks the lige of its host completely, it also dies.
Is man a suicidal god?
Will the paradise of Earth burn in flames?
Bring us the end.
Harvest the crops of Men.
Horrid winds are blowing today
Hear them!
Its is the wrath of Cain.
Bringer of plagues and disease
Doom leads your hand
Writing the Apocalypse
A Gods that wants to die
A tragic kind of killer
Lunatic, fanatic
your self's greatest deceiver.
Sulphur rain.
You'll know the secrets of Hell.
Your leaders... revealed.
Shadows cover the naked kings.
Bringer of plagues and disease.
Doom leads your hand
Writing the Apocalypse
A Gods that wants to die
A tragic kind of killer
Lunatic, fanatic
your self's greatest deceiver.
You can turn Paradise into a wasteland.
It is your greatest design.
As tyrant, you demand nature's powers to obey.
From suicidal wrath no one will escape...
Where am I? How I got in here?
I feel so tired, as if I walk for many miles.
What I see is a door leading out of this room.
I am prepared to confront whatever waits behind...
I left the room. I am walking through a corridor.
It is so long that I cannot see its end.
Opening doors, moving in circle
Finding doors, moving in circle
Opening doors, moving in circle
Finding doors...
All the choices I once made, the paths that I designed,
Have formed this endless labyrinth, a product of my mind.
He is trapped inside the maze.
Opening doors, moving in circle
Finding doors, moving in circle
A madman... the Architect
Mirror world. Mystery. Beyond the wall of skin.
Ecstasy, bond of souls, so clear as time withdraws.
Astral life runs through me... our sacred unity.
Alien thoughts, web of souls, the eldest tree, immortal.
A chord that binds the whole, darkness surrounds us all.
Your shadow follows me, your thoughts reflecting in me.
From dusk until the dawn a shape of things to come.
A lunar fantasy? A different kind of me?
Mirror world. Mystery. Beyond the wall of skin.
Ecstasy, bond of souls, so clear as time withdraws.
If I can use your skin, you are there for me"
If I can smell your scent...
A chord that binds the whole, darkness surrounds us all.
Wolf's shadow follows me, strange thoughts reflecting in me.
From dusk until the dawn I shape of things to come.
Is it my fantasy? A therion in me?
If I can use your skin, you are there for me.
If you can think of me, if you can dream of me,
If I can smell your scent...
If you can think of me, if you can dream of me,
If you can sense me I am still there... in you!
Can you feel me? Can you hear me?
Duality!
Can you feel me? Don't you fear me?
If you can think of me, If you can dream of me...
Can you feel me? Can you hear me?
Can you feel me? Don't you fear me?
If you can think of me, If you can dream of me...
In the arms of night
Laid corpses with forces drained
They strived to live
Celestial bodies scattered
A final breath of sulfur
Planets that rule the abyss
The architects behind this carnage
They are black holes in the sky
Predators lurking as spiders
Whirlpools that cannot be seen
Are sucking the dark oceans dry
Victors in these killing fields
Crushing the essence of others
War in Heaven...
Planets that rule the abyss
The architects behind this carnage
They are black holes in the sky
Predators lurking as spiders
Whirlpools that cannot be seen
Are sucking the dark oceans dry
Victors in these killing fields
Crushing the essence of others
Fighters
Battalions turned to ashes
Dark Suns
Event horizon masters
Fighters
They clash with ruthless violence
Dark Suns
The mighty atom smashers
From the silence of a headless horror, learn!
When an answer comes in mind, more questions follow,
Knowledge burns like an everlasting flame.
The Promethean regime,
My authority supreme
From the silence of a deadly horror...
Burn...
My disciples wear a burning halo
Burn...
An epiphany experienced in ultra violet
As the seeker finds the truth he wants to find
Purifier of thoughts, in the clarity of forms
Learn
From the silence of a headless horror, learn
Burn
Feel the hunger of the dark explorer
Burn
From the silence of a deadly horror...
Burn...
My disciples wear a burning halo
Burn...
From the silence of a headless horror, learn!
In times of endless wars
The blood awakes the beast
The dragon had a son
A mad impaling prince
Known by the name of Vlad
Ruler with an iron fist
Defender or Tyrant?
Where chaos rules supreme.
Head of the order of Dracul
Defender or Tyrant?
Where chaos rules supreme.
Head of the order of Dracul
The forest of the impaled
Lined enemies as trees
Their corpses in decay
They dared to disobey

Working, breeding
A hidden code inside
Tireless, effective
Integral part of the hive
We must control the masses
We have to rule their fears
We are the Will Divine
The Will Divine
Brainwaves, feelings
On programs we design
Clockwork empire
You are the prototype
Lunatic demigod
A faulty code inside
Lunatic demigod
The Prototype

Once you were sentient beings
Once you dared to live with laughs and tears
Now you are only human machines
Our humanoid toys that mimic living

Once you were sentient beings with laughs and tears
Now you are only human machines
Our humanoid toys that mimic living
Idols, archetypes, icons and scarecrows
We embrace pain
The value of suffering
The hooks sting, removing skin
The punishment of self
A task we learn to do so well
Pleasure leads to hell!
We are the Flagellants
Your faithful servants
Persecutors and martyrs
Victims of faith
Stand against our enemy
Fire
The blessing touch of your despair
Despair and loneliness
You'll rise up, before you fall again
Atrocious
The bird of prey is haunting us
Conquer your fears
Surpass your weaknesses
Withstand the fall and stand up again
Provoking, disturbing, resisting
Surviving the ordeal
As a father-head of all of us
Your flame will forge our hearts, even in oblivion!
Resurrection brings our hopes to life
And the lies and fears dissolve
We are strong
Guide us
Your fire in our hearts
You are bringing fear to gods
Your fire in our hearts
The children of Prometheus
Prometheus...
As a giant, standing tall
In a shadow close the blackness
Prometheus
As your breed, we are bound to fall
But our light will scare the darkness
Titan...
Misty moon of Saturn
A veil conceals your face
Methane rain keeps falling, clouds roaring
Your vivid landscapes
With deltas, lakes and seas
Massive mountain stones, glassy frozen thrones
Titan...
Your name strikes fear
A giant sphere!
With terraforming
Your soil will have our seed
Massive mountain stones
Stolen icy thrones
Titan...
Human
Humans will raise
The Titan race
Voiceless up to this day
The shock was really strong
No words my mouth could say
Restraint, but protected behind the asylum's gates
From the screams and the tears of the dead
Erased mistakes
Like victims disposed
No names
No traces
Cases closed
The shock was really strong
No words my mouth could say
Disturbing thoughts
Confessions that make me shiver
But I cannot stop the voices in my head
Anger still lurks within
Confessions of a serial killer
The flashbacks make me shiver
Confessions of a serial killer
Make the voices stop
Confessions of a serial killer
The flashbacks make me shiver
Confessions of a serial killer
Make the voices stop
Make the voices stop
Cold, pale, grey...
Standing still against the change of seasons
Without a coffin, the corpse of yesterday
Ground Zero...
Catacomb of perished memories
Empty slot in this necropolis
Ground Zero...
Not a soul, not even troglodytes
There's not a soul...
Washed away with the rain
All the stains that were made from blood
And the canvas is white...
No traces of blood
Washed away with the rain
All the stains that were made from blood
And the canvas is white
From an artist lobotomized
Cold, as a winter's day
Pale, as a ghost in chains
Grey, as the ashes that drift with a nuclear wind
Cold, Pale, Grey
Cold, as a winter's day
Pale, as a ghost in chains
Grey, as the ashes that drift with a nuclear wind
Blood is pumping, heart is beating again
No frame of reference for this altered state
Time kept running in my temporary absence
Blindly watching in the gardens of the awakened
Perseverance of a soul misplaced
Sole survivor on a desolate place
No welcoming faces
I am the first
No others to greet me
I am the first
Endless paths to take, leading far away
I am the first...
Endless paths to take, leading far away
I am the first Immortal
I am the first
I am the first Immortal
Part man, part machine
Wearing my synthetic skin
I am the first
I am the last!
Waiting the drawing of the underworld
None to share your fears
The shadow of Charon falls
Upon the stone of hopes
The body is paralysing
The air is too thick to enter
A cataclysm is spawned into the regions of the soul
The cry of the first time
When you were free from the womb,
Is the same but now you are entering the night
Most try to understand why they are born if they must die.
Life seems pointless with an end
They wonder if existence remains after death
Or Erebus is the final state
You knew from the beginning
That the end will come in time.
Yet, so many things you left undone
So many more unknown
In a life that is but a dream
Into a gods dream.
Most try to understand why they are born if they must die
Life seems pointless with an end
Existence is a choice that remains after death.
Erebus is my mental state.
In a dream I saw a man
A face not strange to me
He stared at me while I was asleep and whispered in my ear
He led me through the corridors of my ancestral home
He stopped one step before one wall, and then I fainted
In the eldest wall of my home I found the entrance of a CRYPT
The view I saw was so obscure,
alien remnants, pentagrams and candles of the floor
The crypt was made as a passage to the gates of reality
And just when I realised the truth I was in a different shape
I hear thousands of sounds
like bestial laughs, deafening flutes and daemonic choirs
Possibilities fall under control, unfolding new dimensions
Preserved from the ancient years
When Earth was just a newborn star
The proof of a distant truth
Arrogantly stands mocking the wind
Guarding mysteries that man has not unchained
An emblem of power has remained, a fallen temple....
Faded pictures all over the walls
Projecting a horrid state of sanity
Figures that don't belong to a human race
Symbols and maps
Architectural miracles carrying the history of a race
That now seems lost
Fears born from the past
Temple of the lost race
Deep inside the heart of the pole
An old ruler of the stars
Buried in a chest from glass,
The answers about our path
Eternal life can't rest asleep
It lurks beneath as force of will
Ancient are the rules set on this world
An emblem of power will remain, a fallen temple....
Fears born from the past
Temple of the lost race
Deep inside the heart of the pole
An old ruler of the stars
In a world of endless light, into the boundless space
Two suns the only gods, two burning holes in the sky
Without a warning the two suns slowly faded
Abandoning their only children unprotected from the cold
Down on their knees. They have total conscience
As night drains their spirit, the inner light of logic
Leaving the bodies to walk this blind planet
Stumbling to others that now are animals, crying light
Setting of the two suns
Then a light came from the horizon
Devouring the land
It wasn't sun!
It took a minute for a flame to become a fire
The great cities will all become ashes
Drifting with the wind
They lasted as long as a spark shines
but their shining was so bright
that it was caught forever
in the spectre of time.
What was a fact became a legend
what was reality became a faded canvas
in the mausoleum of civilizations.
Landscapes of untold antiquity
unchanged are calling
to an orgy of colours and shapes
in a drunkenness with pure fantasy
Their names cause awe and awake
forgotten senses
and names that echo
in the labyrinths and the cavernous
dephts of chaos
Mystic Places of Dawn
Maybe we, ourselves want to forget
helping the truth to grow old
and be deformed from the wrinkles
of uncertainty
Afraid where the path backwards will
lead us
we prefer to be protected
under the shelter of ignorance
He who stares back
through the glass of centuries
will also see his reflection.
And names that echo
In the labyrinths and the cavernous
dephts of chaos
Mystic Places of Dawn
The mist unfolds its veil
as the night falls in the forest
The moisty wind forces the trees
to sing their sorrow.
For centuries they are standing still
like a petrified dream.
Traped bodies in a wooden web,
tall towers of another epoch.
This sweet melancholy
that is brought by the precious memory
The Pale Beauty of the Past
is kept in the whisper of the wind.
Only the fragile heart
can understand the charm of the old.
The best things in life are those we can't
have yet, still we hope.
Blessed will be the day
when the circle will be complete.
Then the song of the muse will be heard
again the mourning of the trees will stop.
This sweet melancholy
that is brought by the precious memory
The Pale Beauty of the Past
lost in the vortex of time.
When the fields are red
like a crimson robe
and the name of the "King" who wears
this robe is MAN
the waves of wrath have been released
to drown the "sinister" and different.
Noble causes sink in oceans of bodies
where flesh and steel is one.
Memories of Ancient Wars
remove the frozen bonds of time.
Return to Carthage
Ages have passed
and savage hordes have bowed
to the true Gods.
Glory is a whore that seduces even a
priest but few are those who taste her
kiss upon the piles of those that she
betrayed.
Return to Carthage
in bitter irony
the proud city lies raped.
Gods of order, Gods of chaos:
Till the next time,
when our pawns will move again
in the fields of our endless battle
The sand beneath your feet
a yellow carpetin
the palace of wilderness
Only king and servant is you
searching for the pyramid
that guards the emerald board
It was a crescent moon
when you have been initiated
in the science of the black earth,
And the optimism of youth
pushed you in quests
into the paper worlds
of the libraries of Cairo
Crescent Moon
Two sides of the same coin
The poor in mind are satisfied
with what they see.
Crescent Moon
And they bear the sign of imperfection
because they miss the other side
the invisible.
Crescent Moon
Few words carved with diamond
could draw the curtains
that cover the glassy cage of senses
The warm touch of the starlight
magnes will be the proof
and the philosopher's stone your trophy
Grab the golden rope and climb
the imaginary walls of your thoughts
you may fall but at least you'll have tried
My mood is like the weather
it changes with unexpected ways
creating a mosaic
based on the antithesis
of cold and warm colours
If you could read in my eyes
you would discover a shade of grey
when I smile
because even when I am collecting
moments of happiness
my mind descends in my shrine
to pray in front of the candle of life.
And its flesh parts are slowly melting
slipping down like white worms.
The walls around are decorated
with nailed butterflies.
Each one a happy thought,
pretty but old and lifeless.
The thirst for joy is never gratified
only grows as pain is interrupting
our wishes
and help us learn through analphabet
of scars.
Melancholy ascended in the surface
knowing that she'll have forever a lair
in the underwater garden.
Serene the azure body that filled
the landscape crowled as ever.
The sound here is a word without a
meaning nothing can agitate the
monotony.
The new and the old event roll indolent
embraced in a circle.
The one takes the place of the other
returning continuously in the beginning.
What didn't belonged in the fluid kingdom
has now become its integral part.
The plunder that was stolen
from the marvelous world of the unknown
is hidden deep.
Imprisoned from the seeweeds
ornamented with the flowers of the sea.
Every piece has its own story
Every creation is also a piece
of its creator.
Behind the coral gate of the garden
are sealed emotions
In an empty room eyes without a face.
They are stirring other images,
glimpses of a distant life,
of a gone life.
The hands cannot identify the face
Behind the Iron Mask
Dim is within on the plane of the mind
a kneeled spirit under the boot of fear
cleansed with torture
traped in purity by the whip.
Daggers from sound penetrate
resistance behind each one,
a Holy inquisitor.
Mouths reveal the presence of
haunted beings unworthy to be said alive.
Open the window
Release the spirit from this empty body
Behind the Iron Mask
Draining pleasures from mental wounds
a need opposed to false excuses
unveils the greatest beast.
I was sailing in the sea of lethargy
Upon an empty dream
When land appeared
And filled the endless horizon.
White pillars from marble
Deep into a garden
Were shining like guiding stars.
The dreamlord.
A frozen voice from inside
Poured out in my dreamworld.
Taste the fruit of knowledge, 
drink the juice of wisdom, 
and you'll see what eyes can't see.
The dreamlord.
You have reached Utopia.
In the garden of illusions
Encircled from the pillars
I found my idol,
But clouds filled the purple sky
And shed their crystal tears,
And the idol became muddy.
The dreamlord.
The right explanation of symbols depends on you.
The sun will send me away.
In the place where the idol was, appeared a white flower.
Reversing the view towards the soul
Absorbed from the swirl of the chaotic ego
Naked from the warm familiar
company of matter
Here desires and fears are shaped,
uncontrolled multiplied in
the rhythm of ecstasy
gathered under the threat of
upcoming afflictions
Parallel futures that may
never happen are blocking
the entrance of the inner most sanctum
They are the guardians
Who is the master of this cosmos
Who posted them here
Illumination comes from within
and levitates the Eidolon
Effigies and marble busts lined in
external chains silent,
laden with creases deep like self deceit
They seem lost in their contemplation
their laurel wreath is withered
Now I know how felt the first amphibian
when allowing the air to inhabit in its lungs
The sceptre was always in my hand
If you ever hear the song of a dying phoenix
don't let sadness close your ears
you may offend the secret face of nature
It is not a mourning but a hymn.
If you ever see the bright pyre strip
the nightly creature from the chains
you'll witness what the most
can only envy
the glorious coupling of the light
with the dark
Burning Phoenix rise
Ash is what you leave to go up high
The flaming bird knows the time
when the astral gates are open time
to fulfil its noble destiny
it was born to fly
Forever, with the burning legions
of its kind.
On wings of smoke they are singing
Their calling is the calling of the free
Fly with us
Fossilized flower I can smell your perfume
covering the distance that
was called into being between us,
from the unexploited accumulation
of different moments
This gift is my inheritance and I honour it
by continuing my journey, in the curve
of the infinite alternating universes.
With anchor the three stable points
that compose your dimensional trap
I can pause and dive in your mortality.
Reality is a rain
drops are falling, are they the same ?
Some will penetrate the earthen surface
and will transform the hidden seed.
Just like fantasy can turn
an empty scenery into a heaven.
Its balance with reason is the scheme
of creation and destruction
Every dream needs a dreamer
to blossom somebody
to sense its perfume even
when he is blinded
from the light of day
Can you smell it too ?
The perfume of life
In the land that was born from
the sperm of winter is
the incarnation of all enchanted fairy tales
An imposing figure
Isolated from an ocean of frozen waves
Trying to unite the sterile earth
with the celestial dome
Like a crystalline bridge of ice
In the claws of four ancient mountains
Ice Castle
Transparent halls filled with
wonder worthless
for those who are sweeping along with
the purposeless flood of wasted feelings.
Priceless treasure
For the children of the serpent dream
In the claws of four ancient mountains
Ice Castle
There they claim life
in a feast with your nightmares
She dances with the moonlight
In a ring with the silent forest
and the stars' jewels
embroidered in her ethereal garment
From silver lips chameleon thoughts
transmitted to the deepest cave
the sanctuary of the sleeping dragon
Slowly recovering its wounded mind
from the false reflections
of a broken mirror
I will cross the moat
that keeps our worlds apart
May your nebulus hands be my shroud
Succubus Priestess
In me you taste your past
In you I experience my future
Her touch is the cold breeze
that numbs my carnal disguise
and makes the glow inside
to blaze up and spread
Torches blend with misty blue
to celebrate the birth
our bond is sealed in red
our kiss is the everlasting moments
You come to me as the flies to the spider
blinded from my intellectual darkening
Try to move in the
holographic image of choice
and I'll project you one of my corridors
The cobweb is so carefully woven
That even the veil dressed fates
bow with admiration.
It has so many ways,
countless like my names
How I adore to mask the truth
so that only the worthy of my
generosity could find it.
I can wait enthrowned in the center
of this necropolis, with patience
built upon the solid stones
of millenniums
Keep feeding on the notorious lotus
swallowing my sweet promises
to sustain your lie made world
Every bite erases the instinct
so you'll become so clean, so empty
keep on feeding me
The seer of Set can recognize
the negative evolution of consciousness
Empires forged, prospered and scattered
like the sand-hills, they seemingly
disappear but are never lost
The Eyes of Set
rivers of life made of sweat and blood
score the slave's skin
as Nile scores the parched plain
The giant rocks he hauls
are never endingly creating
monuments to snakes
that change their skin
Miserable descendants of Sisyphus
just play their role
as body obeys to the intentions
of the mind
The Eyes of Set
They are the grass, we are the blade
that reaps redemption.
Praise Set and join the stormt
hat will turn their hopes into dust
The chalice is full of sea
fallen leaves upon her face
A map of green continents
Once part of the same tree
Away from where they belonged
Near sits a part of my twin moon
captured from the mirror waters
The sacred drink withdraws oblivion
This is the only way to meet
my full of craters sister
because her grim presence
stands always against
the golden rays of my sun.
How many friends I had,
how many enemies.
Now only absence
Love, its purest form is Narcissism
I remain and they remain through me
but only I exist.
Youth preserved, embalmed from history
In courts of exotic domains
sirens play with the strings of the rainbow
in a harmonious elegance
the story of a king.
Decline is the symptom of the failure to evolve forwards
Change was and will be the most permanent element of experience
deny to go on and you will be left back
Going backwards by remaining stagnant
We watch from our abodes
As hawks we cut the electric skies.
With pride
We keep the order, designing fate
We give access to countless futures...
A time of exodus will come.
The time to break out from the womb
And ships will lower down on Taia
On shining arks then we will go
On lands and stars forgotten...
The origin of riddles, what can restore the lunar wings
Is challenge of the underworld
For challenges to come, we will stand against the tide
Under the banner of the brave
the future belongs to the brave
Decline is the symptom of the failure to evolve forwards
Change was and will be the most permanent element of experience
We watch from our abodes
As hawks we cut the electric skies.
With pride
We keep the order, designing fate
We give access to countless futures...
The origin of riddles, what can restore
The lunar wings is challenge of the underworld
For challenges to come, we will stand against the tide
Under the banner of the brave
the future belongs to the brave
Where the crossroads meet is the axle
Of the grand wheel
The heart that reverberates my beat.
I wear the talisman of Thot,
The sign of our unity
Because it has a part of the universe
A part of me.
And my love is strong because nothing can divide
Me from the object of my ultimate affection.
When the moon steals the crown from its rival
Night enters day. Bring forth the eclipse
The schism that reconstructs my lucid kingdom.
And all my children by their birth right
Wear porudly my crown, my horns of pwer
And those who sense my circle thoughts are all witnesses
Welcome to the joyous carnival of passion
Where the mind surrenders to the animal.
Smell the seductive odor of the naked skin
Bathed in the exotic oils, the potions of desire.
It would be folly to defy the eldest law
For resistance will only supply the fire of lust
With her wooden excuses.
We are here to drink this old wine without remorse
To spill the fluid of Genesis
In abundance because we all know
That as this elixir of life will flow
We will be left exhausted but smiling.
Nails sink into sweaty ground
Marking dionysiac stings
Sparks set from velvet tongues
That bring close soft orange lips
Paths lead inside warm nests, that scared shrines of sin
As serpents we crawl beneath
The guises that we all wear.
It would be folly to defy the eldest law
For resistance will only supply the fire of lust
With her wooden excuses.
So it will grow stronger and stronger
Until fatally it will consume the renegades
With the flames of their denied satisfaction
Hedonism, power in life without end
Morality and remorse banished
An epitaph of useless beliefs and countless mistakes
Left to the outcasts.
Those who were foudn guilty for self torment
Never admitting so, betrayed by their shiver
While mutilating their happiness
With razor blades of guilt
Their voices rise like an irritating whisper
But there is no need for warriors
That can not win their own battles
Razor blades of guilt
No beggars are allowed in, to feast in sympathy
This treasure is kept and shared
With the beloved loyal comrades
Wearing the title of the trinity
Warlord, magician and king
Hands are raised grasping golden cups
In a toast for hedonism.
Power in life without guilt
A stranger once whispered:
A fallen angel is someone not aware of his authentic identity
Because the fall occured nowhere except on the inner plains
And the broken wing was nothing but the bleeding memory
The creators of the prophecies
Have seen pages yet unturned
From a book that can not be read
Or expressed from mouths of scorn
Observing the divine marriage
Between the solid soil and the ether
Step on the lightnings and ascend
On the topmost step of the earth
Stepping on the belt that surrounds the sphere
Endless are the joys of the infinite quest
For the timeless explorer
And the child that lurks inside
On the topmost step of the earth
Stepping on the belt that surrounds the sphere
A billion toys to play, countless more to invent
In the mental playground, around its solid tree
The creators of the prophecies
Have seen pages yet unturned
From a book that can not be read
Or expressed from mouths of scorn
On the topmost step of the earth
On the topmost step of the earth...
Stepping on the belt that surrounds the sphere
Behold that a path is created from these traces of ink,
Letters join numbers
Sounds come forth manifesting the plasticity.
This is the direct outcome of the continuous war
The collision of the worlds of change and stability
One would sense the mind behind them
If only he could withdraw from the relentless alterations of its forms
I have swum against rivers of fallacy
Chaotic symmetry,
And have returned
From the point of weakness
To the root of triumph.
Between the circular entrances of spinning dark suns
I travelled with the company of a triangle
To the dark corners of cosmos
Geometry in static
In frozen wells I left my seal for the future travellers
Sunken trilithons bear my signature
In wombs of yellow on the phosphoric remnants
Of organisims with consciousness long erosed
One would sense the mind behind them
If only he could withdraw from the relentless alterations of its forms
Between the circular entrances of spinning dark suns
I travelled with the company of a triangle to the dark corners of cosmos
Geometry in static
From inside a cloud with the shape of a grey owl
Scanning down the hill of an indian scared site
I can see a figure with hair white like the snow
The polar crystal breath.
Gyrating around the pyre like a planet in orbit
Around the burning mass of a life giving sun
Following the ways of the ageless
Parallel not our paths can cross
In a shower of meteor storm
As you have sung for me
Now I sing for you
As you have welcomed me
Now I welcome you
The shaman
From inside a cloud with the shape of a grey owl
Scanning down the hill of an indian scared site
I can see a figure with hair white like the snow
The polar crystal breath.
As you have sung for me
Now I sing for you
As you have welcomed me
Now I welcome you
The shaman
Let's take our place as stars in the night sky...
A peacock rests alone in the vitreous valley
With an innocent pose like it does not know
On its featheres ventaglia thousands of eyes
Empty since the end of oracles
Clouds create a hollow pillow
For sleepy heads to rest
By denying to submit to the whims
Of their unstable paterns, I glide above them all
Heaven below
Light as a thought, dropping the weight of milleniums
How far can once reach
The answer depends on who this one is
How far can one extend
As far as his limits go...
Heaven below
When alliance has the value
of a broken royal seal,
heroic is the denial to bent
to a flamboyant mighty siege.
Falcons are their arrows
like a forest seem their sheilds.
Catapults are spitting wrath
causing a waterfall of collapsing
castle walls.
In anvils was methodicaly forged
a diplomacy of the sword
A plot has provided the rope
to hang the bloody flag of war.
Vow that no truce will stop the conflict
Fierce if a purpose born from greed.
Justified all actions must be
for honnor to rest untained.
Tomorrow has to car the lessons
that will nourish the naire.
Vow that no truce will stop the conflict
Fierce if a purpose born from greed.
In the mines of the darkest star.
The one no jewel can never shine.
A rode is left to point to Styx,
both its end can lead,both can deceive.
No traps can seize,THE ELDEST COSMONAUT
as time stands still,incapable to breathe.
Once in clay I allowed the decades
to become a stone wall around me
but at least I became the wall of decades.
Can you feel the wrinkles on my hand?
They are yours.They are lines I once
drew upon the sand...
I HAVE A BOAT UNSEEN A LABYRINTHINE SPHERE
THE GNOSIS OF THE ELDEST COSMONAUT.
AND MAYBE YOU WILL SEE
THAT I AM WHAT YOUR MIND CAN NEVER.....SEAL.
Travelling the luminiferous waters of space,
through the Stellar Isthmus.
It can lead it can decieve.
No traps can seize me,
No toombs can seal me.

Black leather gloves
on soft thin hands.
Red Celtic knives,
sharp as your touch.
HUNTING EAGLE PROUDLY LAND
ON THIS ISLAND THAT'S MY HEART.
Twin Mirrors blue.
Cold lakes consealing Fire.
Red coral hair.
A dazzling ruby dome
HUNTING EAGLE PROUDLY LAND
ON THIS ISLAND THAT'S MY HEART.
ELEGANCE COMBINED WITH GRACE
DRESSED YOUR MARBLE SMILING FACE.
Tranquility...How necessary, how boring it can be.
The liquid void has no ears
to receive the consolation of the surface.
MAYBE IT'S BETTER THAT WAY
WHAT DOESN'T TOUCH DOESN'T HURT
The innocence of a swan
gliding on a desolate lake
can't be sensed
and therefore can't bring jealousy.
Entire worlds full of wonder are banished
to rest only in few visionary minds,
haunting them with their glowing beauty.
Fortunately,there are always
those with the forked tongue
to bring the borders closer.
But there are also tribes of inferior beings,
beings so proudly inferior
necessary to give worth to the higher.
But not without cost...
They liberate ordeals.
Their negative thought is the fungus,
the grim vestment of the relic.
THE ERODING FRANKINCENCE OF MARASMOUS
CAN BECOME UNTOLERABLE.
Their region is warm like a blanket
but narrow as a coffin,
an UNDERWORLD.
Fortunately there are always
those with the forked tongue
that bring the borders closer...
Preserved from the ancient years
when Earth was just a newborn star
The proof of a distant truth
arrogantly stands mocking the wind
guarding mysteries that man has not unchained.
An emblem of power has remained , a fallen temple....
Faded pictures all over the walls
projecting a horrid state of sanity.
Figures that don't belong to a human race
Symbols and maps.
Architectural miracles carrying the history of a race
that now seems lost.
Fears born from the Past
TEMPLE OF THE LOST RACE
deep inside the heart of the pole
an old ruler of the stars
Buried in a chest from glass,
the answers about our path.
Eternal life can't rest asleep
it lurks beneath as force of will.
Ancient are the rules set on this world.
An emblem of power will remaine , a fallen temple....
Fears born from the Past
TEMPLE OF THE LOST RACE
deep inside the heart of the pole
an old ruler of the stars
In a dream i saw a man .
A face not strange to me.
He stared at me while i was asleep and wispered in my ear.
He led me through the corridors of my anscestral home.
He stoped one step before one wall, and then i fainted.
In the eldest wall of my home i found the entrance of a CRYPT.
The view i saw was so obscure,
alien remnants, pentagrams and candless of the floor.
THE CRYPT was made as a passage to the gates of reality.
And just when i realised the truth i was in a different shape.
I hear thousants of sounds
like bestial laughs,deafening flutes and daemonic choirs.
Possibilities fall under control, unfolding new dimensions.
In a world of endless light, into the boundless space
two suns the only gods, two burning holes in the sky.
Without a warning the two suns slowly faded
abandoning their only children unprotected from the cold.
Down on their knees.They have total consience,
as Night drains their spirit,the inner light of logic
leaving the bodies to walk this blind planet.
Stumbling to others that now are animals,crying light.......
SETTING OF THE TWO SUNS.......
Then a light came from the horizon
devouring the land.
It wasn't sun
It took a minute for a flame to become a fire.
The great cities will all become ashes ,
drifting with the wind.
Waiting the drawing of the underworld
none to share your fears.
The shadow of CHARON falls
upon the stone of hopes.
The body is paralizing.
The air is too thick to enter.
a cataclysm is spawend into the regions of the soul.
The cry of the first time
when you were free from the womb,
is the same but now you are entering the night.
Most try to understand why they are born if they must die.
Life seems pointless with an end.
They wonder if existence remains after death
YOU KNEW FROM THE BEGGING
THAT THE END WILL COME IN TIME.
YET, SO MANY THINGS YOU LEFT UNDONE
SO MANY MORE UNKNOWN
IN A LIFE THAT IS BUT A DREAM
INTO A GODS DREAM.
Most try to understand why they are born if they must die.
Life seems pointless with an end.
EXISTENCE IS A CHOICE THAT REMAINS AFTER DEATH
Our patience has been dried away
since a long time...
And the thirst,the need to unfold desire,
Transforming it into a touchable object.
How bitter was the taste of emptyness
in our illformed mouths
but it was natural as our ideas
was based on wishes younger,
Weed as fruits at first.
YOUR FATHERS KNEW
THESE WORLDS BY HEART
EVEN THOSE THAT NEVER EVER CROSSED
THE EERIE SIDE.
We came to see the upper world.
Where colours dance and the air moves bright
We came to see...
As a cat with her claws extended
orchestrates a merciless grasp,
weapons move damn swiftly
in an attacking stance,
ready to cut through
and open doors grimson.
YOUR FATHERS KNEW
THESE WORLDS BY HEART
EVEN THOSE THAT NEVER EVER CROSSED
THE EERIE SIDE.
LET ME HEAL YOUR WOUNDS WITH MINE
NOW THAT YOU HAVE DECEIVED THE NIGHT.
REST ASSURED THAT NONE OF US
WILL EVER LOSE THE WAY TO YOU.
THESE STAINS ARE ALSO TRACES
AND THEY CLEAN CONSCIENCE
AS IT IS THEIR DUTY TO DO SO.
THE ORDER WAS STRICT,
CONQUER OR BE CONQUERED.
Our patience has been dried away
since a long time
And the thirst,the need to unfold desire,
Transforming it into a touchable object.
HOLD NO MORE YOUR HORSES
LET THEM RUN LIKE LAVA
MELTING STONE AND GRANITE
IN HOLLOW CAVES.
Raging Victory acts as shepherd
leading the way.
The Eldest Cosmonaut
SHINE.
In the mines of the darkest star.
The one no jewel can never shine.
A rode is left to point to Styx,
both its end can lead,both can deceive.
No traps can seize, THE ELDEST COSMONAUT
as time stands still, incapable to breathe.
Once in clay I allowed the decades
to become a stone wall around me

A millenium passed away, 
small forests became jungles, 
mountains were devoured from sand violently exiled from sand violently exiled 
from vast deserts with the help of hands made from storms.
It was as if someone wanted to erase the traces.
The triumphant laughs of liberation are forgotem.
The world that once seemed nes and vibrant turned pale and old.
Why?
Maybe because of the strange inhabitants were too eager to forget the path that led them through.
In their journey they were leaving behind not only spoken: 
not only part of their body but also part of their mind.
And they became so tired, all they demanded was to rest.
It wasn't difficult.
There was not any apparent changes.
So a strange kind of sleep.
Fell among the lot.
The more they cultivated this habbit.
To seek in the deep matters of Lethargy.
The more their enviroment changed.
It was a curious transformation.
It was as if someone wanted to erase the traces.
Hoever there is one trace that will ever remain.
Week as a whisper it can reopen the way.
Just listen.
Your Fathers knew these words by heart even those that never crossed, 
the eerie side.
Her mind is trapped as a bird in a golden cage in a neutral grey room
But while the others are content to hold their bars as shields, 
against my open asymmetry
She dives beneath the surface of what things are supposed to be, 
where thoughts avoid the rest.
Lay down the Earth, 
lay down the sky
Elishanth mistress of the wind
Ring the bell and the winter will be spring
Learned to expect the fall. 
No attempt to break the spell
Sad is the woman of the rings and I can cease her pain.
Ride on your silver horse to the deserts of the moon
Sing to the hunting wolves and fullfill your everlasting need
Pretend, that nothing can change and the next thing 
that you'll claim is that you did your best.
There is a voice heard only from the heart.
When she is ignored her cry is sadness.
Elishanth mistress of the wind
Ring the bell and the winter will be spring
Hate me
Help me
Convert my mind
Direct me to your gloom
The halls of kingdom
To the land of no return
Take me ignorant
Show me your master and creator
Take me
Take me to the tombs of your sacred relics
Where bodies bend like weak betrayers
What a fitting punisher you are
Bring your own redemption
The touch of the nails to the skin is the fruit of your love for masochism
I don't deserve your trance
I am the adversary of a dominant race of zealots
I am the kind that doubts the unreason
Unbeliever
I won't forget to ask the question before I give an answer to me
On the land of no return there are all that you can't find:
The lack of sense - The lack of anything that you can feel
I won't decide to play the master instead I chose to be
You say I am incomplete
I say I'll always be
Cover your mouth with tape
Cover your heart with pain
Cover your eyes with shame
Spend all your life in vain
I don't deserve your trance
I am the adversary of a dominant race of zealots
I am the kind that doubts the unreason
Hate me
Help me
Convert my mind
Direct me to your gloom
The halls of kingdom come
To the land of no return
Take me ignorant
Show me your master and creator
I don't deserve your trance
I am the adversary of a dominant race of zealots
I am the kind that doubts the unreason
Unbeliever
Hail to those that walk my lonely path
Bearing the mark of the chosen one
They are the cross!
They are the travellers of the plains
Common ground of all directions
They lead to me
I lead to them
Never lie to me
The father of lies
Never deny your deeper desires
To all those true to me
Their instinct and mind
I grant
The Virtues of the Beast
Forged in fire
Iron wills of warlocks and witches nourish me
With their love they heat my broken wings
Making me strong
Lifting me up
Above the dream
Blessed are the restless minds
The angel tribes: for they shall inherit the earth
Blessed are the morning stars for
They shall burn the heavens with their Luciferian light
The Virtues of the Beast
Never lie to me
The father of lies
Never deny your deeper desires
To all those true to me
Their instinct and mind
I grant
The Virtues of the Beast
All my life I strived to gain insight to things that sacred most men
Through the dungeons of the mind I learned the tricks playing with fire
Evil wears a weird facade invented to protect man's hate
For the painful, 
The unknown, 
The feared and the forbidden
I dreamed the devil was I
My quest complete
I dreamed the devil was I
I was awake
My quest complete
Faust
Captive from philosophies that root on hopes like rotten trees
I see the hanged men on their ropes
Which harvester will rip these crops?
If their soul deserved a dime their chance is lost
No bargain now
I want now all that I can get
Riches, Power, Pleasure without end
I dreamed the devil was I
My quest complete
I dreamed the devil was I
I was awake
My quest complete
Faust
I dreamed the devil was I
Faust
So they promised you the stars
The happiness of your distant hopes
But as you tried to catch the moon
Its silver cape slipped through your fingers
Fake was the dawn of their mortality
You are drowning from the flow of your emotions
When all is none
There is a miracle for every soul
An easy way to loose control
The puppeteer and his dolls entertain the frantic crown
Invisible lands your stolen laughs
When all is none
When all is none
Who would be the most competent guardian for you
Than yourself?
Always in range
Under detention even at your sleep
Your life a white chalk on a small blackboard
When all is none
Die
When all is none
Equinox is at hand
The gates are now aligned
Raise the candles in the air and give the secret sign
The temperature is dropping down
Our breath seems now like smoke
The guardians of the shadow lands blind the heathen eyes
Our mental variation
a phantom made from light
With red we paint our fantasy until it breathes with might
Deciphering the code that releases the unknown
We make the wanted possible
Material like the stone
Red code cult
Welcome to our church disciples of the jackal
Your nature is key
Now raise the veils of the misty tyranny of the fake laws
Open the Choronzone
Our mental variation: 
a phantom made from light
With red we paint our fantasy until it breathes with might
Deciphering the code that releases the unknown
We make the wanted possible
Material like the stone
Red code cult
Can you pay the fair?
Open your mouth and spit the buried coin
The boat is ready to sail
Step inside
I am the ferryman
We'll sail the river of woe
The Dark River
Dark River
On its brink is the end of hope
The Dark River
And a wind blew like the breath of a dying man
And the waters spawned sounds
From the motion of slimy reptile tongues
My guests are many
And they won't leave this peaceful place of fading screams
Eyes shut
Gaze mesmerized at the circular form of zero
They sailed the river of woe
The Dark River
Dark River
They found the end of hope
The Dark River
Dark River
They found the end of hope
The Dark River
On tunnels underground
chthonian delties mock
the icons that turned blank
The shades of the once beautiful
Can you pay the fair?
Open your mouth and spit the buried coin
The boat is ready to sail
Step inside
I am the ferryman
Dark River
Desire manifests with endeavour
A form of spiritual eroticism
Magic is a goblet that seems hollow
A fountain strives to fill It to the brim
Magic loves infinity
A masquerade of visions so profoundly loved
Shroud the murky eyes of the sorcerers
Evoked from the vortex of their mind fields
As waves they spread in circles to reach the endless sea
Magic loves infinity
On the land between the rivers
where lions fly and serpents rule
I cross the road to the ziggurat
as darkness hides the moon
I came to seek the advice of Inanna
The goddess of love and war but the path is unclear
like the words of a Seer from the movement of the dunes
Windy whisperers come
From beyond the clouds
Descend with glory to the plane earth
Gas shaped nauseous forms hide behind the storm
As scorpions blended with the yellow red sand
Before me are the steps that lead to virtual ascension
A mystical technology
The temple of dimensions
The mysteries of Sumer manifest inside the chamber
that sits upon the top of this artificial mountain
Sumerian Daemon
My veins are black from the blood of Tiamat
My eyes are wide like the wheels of space and time
My will is strong like a blow from Marduk's sword
I am no human now because I choose to know
Sumerian Daemon
A malfunction to the machine
She chews its screws of sanity
Losing parts of human seed
As she lusts for electricity
Plastic attitude gray emotions
Wear your cables and join with me
Boring lives in entropy
Incorporeal surgery
Environmental therapy for the genes that threat security
A new breed of mass murderers
Instructed from their parents to do the task
Mechanical our whore Babylon
The old hag looks so young in her dress of silicon
A jungle in her heart made from concrete, glass and metal
Mechanical our whore Babylon
Her kiss of methadone
Is a drug that steals control
She wants her clockwork toy
Disconnected from the physical
Plastic attitude gray emotions
Wear your cables and join with me
Boring lives in entropy
Incorporeal surgery
Mechanical our whore Babylon
The old hag looks so young in her dress of silicon
A jungle in her heart made from concrete, glass and metal
Mechanical our whore Babylon
Silent but not alone
You are waiting for the dawn
To open the gates of the horizon
So that you can get through
The chasm that cuts in two
The worlds of now The worlds of ever
Casting your fiery arrows
A hunter among the stars
Up from your golden chariot
You throw the spear of time
Infernal sun
You act like a rightful tyrant
Casting away the cold
Your crown is the flame infernal
Eating the heat of soul
Infernal sun
Silent but not alone
You are waiting for the dawn
To open the gates of the horizon
So that you can get through
The chasm that cuts in two
The worlds of now The worlds of ever
The watchers learned to fly
and bridged the realms defined
The wealth was spreading far and wide
A sorcery divine
From the abode of heavens the seed of life was cast
Celestial orbs and fireballs from conflict fashioned lands
Nocturnal treasures glow and frozen crystals dance
The wealth was spreading far and wide
A sorcery divine
Fallen angels
They were called the feared
The loved
The worshiped
They came to built the new empire
To make a land of promise
Protectors of the realms
These beacons in the sky
They warned about the cataclysm their sons that led mankind
Empire of the Watchers
From the abode of heavens the seed of life was cast
Celestial orbs and fireballs from conflict fashioned lands
Nocturnal treasures glow and frozen crystals dance
The wealth was spreading far and wide
A sorcery divine
The watchers learned to fly
and bridged the realms defined
The wealth was spreading far and wide
A sorcery divine
The transformation of the butterfly occurs in reverse
Beauty eaten abruptly from the ancient worm
Wearing sharp shard
Stolen from scattered
Broken mirrors
As a cloak to cover me
My strange images
nest as birds to the hearts of men
And as birds fly away
Taking their thoughts into oblivion
Disintegrating the elemental bonds
I obtain the rapture of the chameleon
When I become enraged
With the frenzy of the wolf on the hunt
I am the most cherished child of fear
Armed with fangs deadly like daggers
I am an adept on the skills of murder
I am the shape shifter
On the ruins of a ghostly projection
echoes the lust for life
An ancient purgatory for the sinister
Shape shifter
The cold comes
The rats in the walls break
The deadly sound of silence
As time decays
You try to name the unnamable
A whispererer in darkness
Our hound smells you
The haunter of the dark
Will come to take you to our realm
Your life, your books
March in front your closing eyes
Beyond the walls of sleep
Lovecraft in the realm of the dead
Obsessed with Necronomicon
The Arab's wicked dream
You found a path to Azathoth
And walked the Dagon's realm
Your friends were haunted too
Do you remember Charles?
Or haven't you heard
The music of Erich Zann
The call of Cthulhu we disguised
With notes and raving rhythms
To spread the seed of lurking fear
Into the heart of man
Lovecraft in the realm of the dead
Your time is out you saw too much
You used the silver key
You know too well that minds like yours
Can never rest in peace
You stared at the abyss
You'll never rest in peace
You'll never rest in peace
Come
Approach
My trusty jackal's nose
Don't try to lie
Cause I can smell your hide
Leave your body
Leave this body now
Your face can stay
Upon this golden mask you made
The brave in heart
Can claim eternal life
My scales of truth
Will need sufficient proof
Their balance depends
On how your soul weights
To walk with Gods
The jaws of chaos you must pass
Anubis
My soul is so light
And as this feather I can fly
Anubis
Don't let me wither and die
I am proud for what I am
The guardian of the dead
Appointed by the gods
To be their final judge
Anubis
Don't let me wither and die
Alien faces
Watching me
Wearing wings
They come to drink
The ancient chalice
Raised so high
In a toast to those who fly
Fallen angels burn the night
Touch me with your hungry eyes
Send your thoughts between the realms
Sharing your eternal dreams
Communion
Some have seen your trembling lights
Dancing in the cloudy night
You appear as strange machines
Changing form, to fit the scene
Demons, angels, poltergeists
Laughing as they play with minds
Altering the face of truth
So that seems as lie to fools
Communion
There are things that can't be seen
They are the things that lurk within
If you seal the mystic bond
You will never be alone
I wear your horns with shameless pride
As a nailed crown
Upon the severed head of a king.
Watching...
Communion
Slay the false king
And claim the throne
You build a tower
A giant mountain
Opened a God's gate
To reach the heavens
Only power
Rules this stargate
You make a statue
A golden idol
Holding his sword high
It will be placed up
Only power
Rules this stargate
All want the power
Now all divided
You speak your words loud
And cannot hear
What the others try to say
Blind confusion
Tongues now slay
Words are burning
Babel's gate
Human's reign
Babel's gate
Sky is on flames
Babel's gate
All in vain?
Babel's gate
Nothing same
Only power
Rules this stargate
All want the power
Now all divided
You speak your words loud
And cannot hear
What the others try to say
Blind confusion
Tongues now slay
Words are burning
We, the gods
we, the gods
live high
to the heavens
right above your heads
We, the gods
we, the gods
hide well
it's so difficult to find us
Don't ever claim we are dead
we rest here and we guide you
You need to be controlled
so yes, we will direct you
Betrayers of our faiths
must pay the higher price
Damnation for the weak
salvation for the faithful
You pray and call our names
and think that we will hear you
Maybe, you don't deserve
an audience with your masters
We, the gods
we, the gods send dreams
to the humans of our choice
We, the gods
we, the gods
give signs
And you must recognize them
We, the gods
we, the gods
save lives
But we demand some sacrifice
We, the gods
we, the gods
Praise love
but also we know war
Hold the spear
face our enemy
abandon yourself
to the storm of the battle
We came in here
to live forever
we smell your flesh 
and we smell your fear
Yesterday as I closed my eyes
My weight was left behind, the body paralyzed
It was a miracle, I floated as a ghost
And there I saw my self lying upon my bed
I stared down, I looked up
Then tried to pass the walls and drift to the unknown
It was the strangest call, as if I heard a soul
I felt the need to find a creature bleeding light
Sunlight
Moonlight
I climbed the sky, above the clouds
And there I saw some more
That answered to the call
Bright shining disks of light
With wings made from the night
The day had yet to come
And so a hunt begun
As my sun is now reborn
My mind awakes, the body is on
Remembrance will hold the door
Until the night will send her call
Sunlight
Moonlight
Flutes and pipes
Play a drunken rhyme
Entertaining
The soldiers in the palace
Naked bodies
Female slaves from Asia
Dance with promise
For a night of pleasure
Mouths smell wine
The feast is going wild
Victorious and glorious
The men exalt their king
As in a fevered dream
Thais is entering
And she provokes him
To do a special deed
You have conquered
The capital of orient
Display your power
And make your enemies weep
Destroy their pride
The jewel of the desert
As they once destroyed
Our temples for their king
Burn this city to the ground
Take a torch and spread the fire
Persepolis
Now a pile of dust
A blackened carcass 
A land of ash
Persepolis
You lost your crown
Persepolis
Burned to the ground
Consumed by hate
Ablaze by pride
Persepolis
Naked as the sand
Persepolis
You lost your crown
Persepolis
Burned to the ground
Burn this city to the ground
Take a torch and spread the fire
There's a sacred ancient cup
Filled with royal bluish blood
Sangreal, how real
In a family of light
Darkest secrets hide from eyes
Sangreal, how real
The elder blood
Still runs on the veins
The modern body
A cup from our skin
Dragon share your mystic soul
With your children
Make them strong
Sangreal, how real
In a family of light
Darkest secrets hide from eyes
Sangreal, how real
Immortal show your fangs
Reveal your hungry faces
Blood needs blood
Flesh needs flesh
Life for life, soul for soul
Immortals...
There is no hope
For the followers of lies
There is no hope
For the weak in the mind
Sangreal, how real
Sangreal...
On the walls of Venus's temple
The tale of Narcissus and Echo
A beautiful young nymph
Sentenced to repeat
The last words of the others
Never to talk first
She fell in love with Narcissus
And followed him longing to speak
He said Who is here" and she replied Here
He called for her saying Come
She just replied Come
As none came near, Narcissus
Called her again
Why do you shun me
She could only say the same
These words hurt deep
His pride his actions leads
I would rather die
Than you should have me
Narcissus went forth
To a fountain in the north
He kneeled down to drink
And then he fell in love
He said Who is here
His voice kept sounding Here
He called again the one
That couldn't ever come
His face was young and
In the crystal waters glowed
His smile was cold reflecting
Back a thought
I would rather die
Than you should have me
Threatening and cold
A poem for the underworld
Where shadows walk
Beyond redemption
Dante's Inferno
Dante's Inferno
Minos wraps his serpent
Tail around himself
To mark a sinner's level
His prison cell.
The famous poet Dante
Is passing through the gates
The only living being
In this accursed place.
Threatening and cold
A poem for the underworld
Where shadows walk
Beyond redemption
Dante's Inferno
Dante's Inferno
The greedy pay the price,
Their wealth is cursed
The wrathful fight each other,
Covered with slimy mud
The flames are burning heretics,
And for the violent ones,
Red blood is boiling.
As thieves will turn to vipers
And vipers will turn to thieves
Ninth, the lower plain.
Who could ever guess?
It is a frozen lake!
An angel in his past, a fallen one,
Right on the spot he crashed,
For aeons is lying down
A human has written all books.
A human mind has thought of the proof
To rule the earth, he had to ascend.
To rule his peers, their will he had to bend
Bibles are portraying a world in black and white.
We invented the devil, so the devil is man!
If Satan was the father and Antichrist the son,
Lilith was the mother and Lucifer the spirit of light.
Reversed is the 3rd Testament
The 3rd Testament
The 3rd Testament
A phantom god guarding your salvation.
He lives in books, your imagination
An abstract thought, lord of all creation
An absent king, the final revelation
If Satan was the father and Antichrist the son,
Lilith was the mother and Lucifer the spirit of light.
What could be more simple and more complex, 
more obvious and more profound than a portrait?
In a world controlled by fire..
In a world controlled by fire,
Psychotic preachers thrive.
They use the waves to bind us,
They use the screens to blind us.
I joined headless forces
They told us what to do.
We worked, we fought, we bled.
A cogwheel in the system,
A ghost in the machine.
In my private thoughts,
Only pain felt real.
Cry!
I am crying, in the portrait
Of a headless man.
Laugh!
I am laughing, in the portrait
Of a headless man
I am a man with strong regrets.
I followed great deceivers
Believed in headless leaders.
They played their game, true sons of Cain
But I was a hopeless dreamer,
With my head deep in the clouds.
More joined the fiery leaders,
And blood was shed in rivers.
Those without a mind had to pick our side,
With the use of fearsome methods.
One more empty frame ready for display,
On a gallery of headless portraits.
Cry!
I am crying, in the portrait
Of a headless man.
Laugh!
I am laughing, in the portrait
Of a headless man
Your books, your friends, your life is in mortal danger.
The things are tense and knowledge is offense.
In this nation vast deception reigns.
Church and politics threaten your survival.
A strife has grown between faith and wisdom.
You chose to stand for the exalted ego.
Your creation, a creation maimed.
Blame the vultures and their vile way.
Run Devil's seed! You will face the wrath of God.
Run Devil's seed! You will face the wrath of God
Run Devil's seed!
You will face the wrath of God.
The highest price you'll pay.
You will face the wrath of God.
The highest price you'll pay.
Martyr
Unyielding force of thought and spirit.
Martyr
Unyielding force of thought and spirit
Your essence remained.
Your work, your life, your books.
Unyielding force of thought and spirit, shine!
The silent borderland
Where words become undone
Brainwave, treachery
A different truth to see
To keep a secret
Misinformation is the key
Twenty first century
New ways of slavery
So many prying eyes
Communication spies
Ghosts are fighting for the cause
With poisoned words
Half truths, false proofs
The trap is set to snare the wolf
The enemy of truth
Fight the enemy of truth
Sense destroyer
Mental surgery
Social lobotomy
Confusion, delusion
We all connect and share
The perfect way for lies to spread
Fight the enemy of truth
Life begins and ends with a breath.
The art of sound is an art in darkness, unseen, yet real as the wind.
Blessed be the night, the architect of all creation.
Her wings are wide and strong and black.
She is bleeding light. Stars form a congregation
She is the force, our soul and fire.
Blind lead the blind.
Another day
The sun is lost.
Nocturnal cities
Secrets lie buried in the sand.
To craft the dark art we used our soul.
Emotions bleed, but we stay strong.
Disciples of the Dark Art.
To craft the dark art, we used our soul.
Emotions bleed, but we stay strong
Darkness binds the world!
Save me!
Another day
The sun is lost
Save me, strong wind.
Strong and bitter and cold and old
Gothic walls below the sea.
Corals rising high.
A building is standing tall,
Fearful, yet majestic.
Surface dwellers never come,
Yet it haunts their dreams.
Tales about Atlantis come to mind.
When the waters kiss
The mouth of madness
And the sea is chanting,
Horrid fish come as guardians
For our church
Our church, below…
Hail! Cthulhu lives.
He escaped the abyss.
Hail! Cthulhu dreams
Of his house in the deep
Hail! Cthulhu lives.
He escaped the abyss.
Placed upon the ocean's floor,
On the abyssal zone.
Sunlight cannot get down here
And freezing currents flow.
Rusting chandeliers
Are hanging from above.
Chthonian priests
Are praying to elder gods.
When the waters kiss
The mouth of madness
And the sea is chanting,
Horrid fish come as guardians
For our church
Our church, below the sea.
Hail! Cthulhu lives.
He escaped the abyss.
Hail! Cthulhu dreams
Of his house in the deep.
When the waters kiss
The mouth of madness
And the sea is chanting,
Horrid fish come as guardians
For our church
Our church, below the sea.
Always so distant.
Hiding from the sun.
He is looking around her,
To find where she is not.
The archway of Heaven,
The saints of the Earth,
Old parts from her broken ribs.
Now she is enthroned
On the spaceless void.
She is breathing fire as a dragon
And we all feel the heat.
Her touch is soft as the wind.
Faceless Queen
A mask your only skin
Faceless queen
Faceless queen,
Can you remove,
Your mask of skin?
She is enigma,
A canvas without frame.
Worshiped as Goddess
By the toys she made from clay.
Behold the Faceless Queen!
Behold the Faceless Queen!
Her realm extends to the endless sea
And she rules from the spaceless void.
She is breathing fire as a dragon
And we all feel the heat.
Her touch is soft as the wind.
Faceless Queen
A mask your only skin
Faceless queen
Faceless queen,
Can you remove,
Your mask of skin?
The serpent with the golden crown,
Faceless staring at the sun.
The serpent sits upon its throne,
Faceless staring at the sun.
Always so distant.
Hiding from the sun.
He is looking around her,
To find where she is not.
Behold the Faceless Queen!
Behold the Faceless Queen!
What you keep feeding with strong emotions and thoughts, 
is growing inside your mind, until finally it starts feeding by itself
Your future life can be at stake.
From good to worse.
Make no mistake!
One moment here, the next one gone.
The seed of terror soon will grow.
We learn to live with fear each day.
It has to be another way.
As moments fly, the things we want will be obtained,
Or maybe not.
Are flowing through the bloodstream.
The fear of failure
The fear of death
The fear of loss
The Gospels of Fear
Embrace fear
A grim companion is always there.
His vicious thoughts are hard to bear.
In every mind, in every soul he gains control.
He offers help but in exchange you have to step inside the cage.
Dare not to question the things you'll see,
All kind of horrors you will perceive.
Toxic thoughts come to thee,
Vicious mouths eating thee.
The Gospels of Fear
Embrace your fear.
I am the abyss,
I am the way,
The secret door to a hidden cave.
A different place to the garden of fools.
You can enter here, if your steps will lead you to…
Thoughts are sailing fast, like ships into a storm.
Dreams are fading; they are heading to a point of no return.
You can call me Trinity, as three divide the whole.
One third of me, is what you see.
A mirror is my astral door.
Trinity
Remember what you always have been.
Trinity
The one that is three.
Trinity
The one possessed by three.
Three times the eclipse.
Before she lay her soul to rest.
Channeling the darkness of many nights,
All this was once her dream.
See and feel,
The blackened blade of revenge.
Cold white towering mountain,
The passage to the land of the phantoms,
Deep forlorned woods,
Where the gleam of neither light or bliss reach.
The castle lies in the mist,
Between the mountains and marshes.
Through the last centuries,
Have the moonshine enlighten her coffin.
The black soul of the hunter
The hungering thirst,
For the enchantress of the night.
The hungering thirst,
Evil, devour its soul.
And since the medieval times,
Have your shadows haunted
Eternally sounds the mighty waves,
A triton's hymn round a rock-strewn grave,
The passing sigh for the bones that moulder,
Over the nordic black sea, where the winds btew colder.
Here in a bed of wrack and shingle,
Beneath rests a sea king of the north,
His fallen history remains unknown,
Now his grave is just a heap of stones.
The waves crest sharp as an unsheated blade,
As spume-topped breakers shorewards loom,
And boulder on boulder on land is laid,
The triton's hymn round a vanished tomb
The ocean cradles it's sleepy wave,
Round the curve of the yellow sand.
Of the bleak and mysterious little isle,
Where no leaf has been touched by human hands.
Then I behold that island so fair,
Where the tree's lift their crown in prayers
To the golden glow of the evening sky
I hold the sword towards the moon,
my memories echoes with cries.
Hark, to the ocean's cold clamerous roar,
The pale mist hovers towards the nightly shores.
For the fire in my burning flame,
Hail to the father of the fallen flame.
Acknowledge the supreme Northern racial purity.
That runs in the blood of my veins.
As the nocturnal curtain falls
With the total eclipse of the moon above...
The pale mist hovers towards the nightly shores.
Once upon a midnight dreary. while I pondered, weak and weary
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one, gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
'Tis some visitor' I muttered, tapping at my chamber door
Only this and nothing more
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
and each seperate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow
Vainly I had sought to borrow
from my books surcease of sorrow.
Sorrow for the lost Lenore
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Nameless here for evermore
The vast windswept wastelands,
Cold horizons opens.
Many traveller has set their course from here,
Few of them have returned.
The utter darkness,
Bleak visions of emptiness,
And the veil to this portal,
Lies in your own belief.
When thousand moon has circled,
In the shadow of endless nights,
The wage of eternal life.
Among the old tree's,
As the dust covers every flower in bloom,
The mourner hide their eyes,
To reap the seeds and harvest.
Withering flowers of the northem autumn,
Shall never thrive again.
The time has ceased,
Now my dreams are true.
Ahh, Dance through the cold shadows of Pan
as tears fall from heaven.
once I had hold the rarest rose,
But, that is now forgotten with time.
Among the tree's I wandered,
To feel the embrace of etemal eclipse
as my candle bums out,
And we must make the myths.
Dark is the moon at harvest
the nightly mist approaches
through the forlorned marshes,
Then darkness has now been achieved.
Crush your earthly virtnes,
As I stumbled through snow and frost
my feeble heart is longing for the wood,
where all dark cast a shadow.
It's pale morrow landscape,
Has now risen through the bleak night
over the moors and mountains,
Flies the hunting ravens, searching,
Dance through the cold shadows of Pan,
As tears fall from heaven,
Then, once I had hold the rarest rose.
Frozen is my pagan heart,
And once again the dawn is here
hear the sound of silence,
In these trees.
Are my gallows.
Deep red,
Face soaked in blood.
Black shining leather.
I fuck you up in sadistic intent.
Whore
I plunge into the wastelands of my heart
And left it there in ruins.
The sun shines once a lifetime.
I will leave you in the cold.
In the dead of the night,
Black leather and latex Queen,
A lush of the world.
The bitter taste of life,
And the coldness
of my heart.
Cunt
I plunge into the wastelands of my heart
And left it there in ruins.
The sun shines once a lifetime.
From the thunder and the storm
Another winter has sneaked upon me again.
There's something strange going on here
on these great cold coastals lines.
The grim vision of Chaos
upon mankind
and life itself.
Nights of black candles
and gallons of strange old brew.
Changing suit into gold.
The grip of frost
and the winds from the north.
Lurking beneath
the surface of the coastal horizon.
Banners of War.
Banners of the Apocalypse.
Hatred towards mankind and life itself.
Violence is fashion
The graveyard soil is changing to stone,
so many of its deaths had been midvinter.
The blinding snowdrifts.
The subzero temperature.
A cold sharpened blade
plunge through the skin.
Death triumphant.
Death the king
Blood on my hands.
Blood on my lips
I took the frail bliss of your eyes
and its darker than you think...
I violate.
I come at night.
My great endurance of body, mind and heart
Let me take you through...
A gust of wind.
Torrent of rain.
Blood and semen
Murder is art
The cold blade.
The cold blade.
Whipped and pierced,
you disbehave.
Underneath the whip
to soothe the beast
Burn a candle from my soul,
for I will never do the same.
Cause I see beauty in another things
and that is light is the wilderness alone.
Kneel before me
and shine my shoes.
I give you much
but you want more
I am the long arm of unforgivingness.
Beholder of all chains.
This tool of great destruction.
This life of feces and filth.
Pick up your teeth with broken fingers.
Lick the blood of your cracked lips.
The colour purple seems to fit you
Bow down...
The toes that you step on today may be
connected to the ass you'll be kissing tommorow.
These feelings are left from you.
Like a vast burning field
and then you submit yourself to me.
Perversion of the flesh.
With needles in thin skinned places.
The warm blood of life poured on the floor,
but who gives a shit when your life is a plague.
A rollercoster ride of pain.
I saw the white in your eyes.
Beat me, she said.
Cruel, violent shotgun love.
I kill you, point blank range.
I drank too much of the midnight wine,
disregardless of whatever i claim my throne.
Your voice kept ringin in my ears
like little echoes from yesterdays.
I did not want,
I did not feel.
At the great wood's mouth,
by the deep cave's door.
I listened to something
I had heard before.
The wood's mouth.
In a field I am the absence.
Wherever I am
I am what is missing.
And in silence I observe
When I walk I part the air
and always the air moves in.
To fill the spaces
where my body has been...
I close my eyelids.
There was nothing more to say.
I've seen it all before.
But, I find comfort in silence,
summer melacholia.
The air shivered against my skin.
Dark leaned into my eyes.
Those threatening clouds.
The sweet music of the summer rain.
The mist in early hours.
The dominant winds.
My associates have denied Christ.
Earthly, heavenly and hellish.
The only guiding light
to you rejoice to see blood flow.
I've know rivers.
I've known rivers ancient as the world
and older that the flow
of human blood in human veins.
My soul has grown deep like those rivers old.
Away under the wings with dark faces
The rulers of the night.
The goddes of Death
I, drinker of blood.
It is nothing to mourn for
It is the other world.
Do you deserve this?
What a tangled web you weave.
Over and over the whips of the world.. 
Come death
before it slips through my hands.
Like long-drawn echoes merging far away
to a deep and pounding harmony.
Vast as the night and as vast as light.
Scents, colours and sounds to each other reply.
Your wounds are infected
and life neglected.
These are the autumn years.
Haunted nights of ghosts and shadows.
You cut the wound to release the pus.
You cut your wrist.
You do not wish to live
and kissed the world bloodred.
Through coldness.
The night is cold and brilliantly clear.
Peak after peak of glorius ice mountains
rose into the dome of the darkened skies.
Jagged crystal teeth queezed between
the depths of the jet-black fjords.
The mountains lost their sharpness and became
soft and blue-tinged as the great winter day.
Which would grow on to be a dim twilight
that glimmered slowly to life.
Above the peaks the Polar sky flickered with
the ghostly radiance of the northern light.
A frozen lake discharge into an equally frozen stream.
The cold is cruel and unforgiving like the landscape.
Up north.
Come closer and see
See into the trees
Find the girl
If you can
Come closer and see
See into the dark
Just follow your eyes
Just follow your eyes
I hear her voice
Calling my name
The sound is deep
In the dark
I hear her voice
And start to run
Into the trees
Suddenly I stop
But I know it's too late
I'm lost in a forest
All alone
The girl was never there
It's always the same
I'm running towards nothing
Again and again and again and again
Blood, sweat and more blood
Love turned to hate
Light turned to dark
And life turned to death
Blood!
The old engine is still running
Cleansing!
The cleansing of the body and soul
Then reach out and touch the branches
The branches of the oldest oak
In these last autumn days
When dim colours are over whelming
And grim
Cold hills darken
Frost is setting in
Discover something old
Discover something new
You have everything to fear
You're hated here
10 times the power
10 times the pain
He rolls you over
And rape what remains
He exists in every town
He is all around
He stab you where it hurts
Up under your miniskirt
Something never never changes
Something never will
He loves the fire
He degrade
He deprive
He is the judge and jury
Of your miserable life
You are his toilet seat
You are beneath his feet
With this spiked device
He rapes you twice
Weaklings,
You are not the only one
Dreamers,
I wish you were all gone
Losers of faith
Grievers of the heart
All the purity of sin
Inner strength
To die for a cause
A martyr's death
An old conscience
Cleansed in blood
A burning obsession
A cold hearted devotion
See into the eyes of evil
And see through the eyes of hell
Losers of faith
Grievers of the heart
All the purity of sin
Inner strength
To die for a cause
A martyr's death
An old conscience cleansing in blood
The cold hands were yours
The stiff face was yours
But you were not there
The eyes were yours, but they were closed
And would not open
The rays of the distant sun were there
The moon on the hills white shoulder
The trip of death, into the unknown
Silent and numb
The human mind, a vast universe
Dive into darkness
Falling further down in despair
The silent watcher of truth
You have lost your battle once, the quest of man
God given immortality
Pain strikes, the horror in their eyes
Rigor mortis, the death stiffness
The trip of death into the unknown
Silent and numb
The human mind a vast universe
Dive into darkness
Come on dead man
You have slit your wrist
Bow down dead man
And slit your wrist again
Razorblade baby
Kill yourself girl
You Christian women
You can't live like this
He's flung high, he's flung low
But he still loves the purgatory glow
This long road leads to you
Feel the anger feel the rush
Search your heart
And get out before all heaven breaks loose
The blood hunger
The addiction
Night, cold night
The stars are not lit tonight
Ice bound river banks
Cold murky waters
The treacherous devilry
Coldest thoughts
Suicide!
The blood hunger
The addiction
Night cold night
Suicide!
Suicide!
In this house that I built
Of cold emotions
Through years of oppression
The suffering which I obey
An unbearable suffering
The rope
The strangulations
The whip
Total submission
In this room that I built
Of devilish lust
A tyrant's possession
Unleashed at dusk
Chained at dawn
Deprivation, solitude
Perfection, lust
In this world that I built
Of no emotions
I whip the skin
I taunt the angel
Forever
And ever
Again
And again
The trail I walk is haunted
By his blinding light
Somewhere
Down there
For eternities undefeated
Unwanted
Untouched
The evil incarnate
The cloak of midnight
Screams are strong
Around the oppressed
Like a blizzard
Like a whirlwind
Like the long lost divinity!
It falls heavy like a stone
I am what I am
Spill the blood one more time
The trail I walk is haunted
By his blinding light
Cloak of midnight
In the night the forest lies cold
Longing for the north wind to return
Hear the sad whisper of the wind
Blackened clouds cover the crescent moon
Evil lords ride the tempest wings
Cursed is the soil of the pathetic fools
The winds of mayhem have returned
To the infernal land of the forest
The return
Dark is the shadow of the reaper
His cold embrace of melancholy
Illuminated are the old roots of evil
Hear the grim anguished cries
Frozen millennium of the evil usurper
From the dark caves of the forest
Freezing winds sweeps the autumn meadow
This is the hellstorm of our infernal ways
The return of the freezing winds
He hung himself in the middle of the night
Found dead in the morning bright light
Got no more lithium
Gave up life
They say: you better give up now
Its not worth the strife
The soul constipation
He's turning blue
And nobody cares
He withered
He's not the only one
Come on get it over with
You're not the only one
He's turning blue
And nobody cares
On a battlefield up north
Tons of steel united in bloodshed
Sombre men of invisible might
The fallen snow covers
All the wounds of the earth
Slaves of restriction
Remains this skeleton earth
The dust kills all sound
We're sucked into a black hole
The eyes that watched
From the top of the hill
The eyes that capture human guilt
A stiff vulture claw shows the way
To a land of mist
To a land of war
Night of torment
Fever, Flames and Hell
In the cold grip of Armageddon
You are born into bondage
You are born as a slave
What am I?
You're a slave
Forever submissive
Forever in holy chains
You are born by a whore
By a filthy cunt
Which spread disease
The disease of god
You have the ability to rise
After a fall
We await impatiently
For a divine sundown
You're a slave
Of your own restrictions
Of Christian morals
Of the book of lies
You have the ability to rise
After a fall
We await impatiently
For a divine sundown
You're a slave
Of your own restrictions
Of Christian morals
Of the book of lies
Stop being so humble
Stop showing remorse
Cut it off
The hands that feed the blind
Can you move?
With those holy chains
The grey horizon
I paint it black
See through tomorrows
Spiteful eyes
The fury of the north men
within those who still believe
The holy slumber must end
After Thousand years of dormancy
Lifeless landscapes
Dead trees up in the hills
Pure autumn bliss
In cold November
On a night of gusting wind
Clouds came down
Together we were beasts
We lay in the cold dusk
Of his negligence
In the mist of the turmoil
Frozen heart
Beast of winter
Mental frost
Beast of winter
Mental frost
The self-mutilation
Necrosis of the soul
Dark is the shadows of life
Hot as Hell
You take the matters into your own hands
From now on it's downhill
A single candle burns
In the vast consuming darkness
Uplifting like a funeral
Through these years you were created
In the void between life and death
A shimmering blade shreds through his flesh
At the peak of his night-time bliss
Misanthropes, kings and queens
And a painful vision of Hell
It burns
The blisters on your hands
So nebulous, dark as December
You should be dead by now
Lost in time and space
But you push the limits further
You hate the human race
I have died from within
The beginning of an end
But I still stand
Seeing red
The anger made me strong
The vision was mine
Horizon becomes vast
Claim your throne
The fire turns to flames
I had it all
Before the fall
Warlords of misanthropy
Powers
Spiritual powers to foresee
Warlords of misanthropy
Warriors of the fall
Through sinful years
The hellish burden
That I was given:
An evil face
The eyes so cold
The dark labyrinth of the human mind
Key to a kingdom
A world of bones
New revelation, anger is the fuel
I am a sinner
On the last dreadful day of judgement
Heaven
I unbind all spirits who
Abide this hole
In symbols speaking
I woke you from the deepest dream
Open the gates
Behold your sentence
In the sign of the cross
And the crown of thorns
The precious human blood
Burning holy tears
Lifetime sinner
Which saw his sign
But the eyes were cold
Three times the eclipse
Before she lays her soul to rest
Channelling the darkness of many nights
All this was once her dream
See and feel
The blackened blade of revenge
Cold white towering mountains
The passage to the land of phantoms
Deep forlorn woods
Where the gleam of neither light or
Bliss reach
The castle lies in the mist
Between the mountain and marshes
Throughout the last centuries
Have the moonshine enlightened her coffin
Black soul of the hunter
The hungering thirst
The enchantress of the night
The hungering thirst
Evil, devour its soul
Since the medieval times
Have your shadow haunted
A spirit rose from the earth
Slowly leaving.
Their candle-flame lonely, and so needing
Like dust in the night the prayers rise
Under the sick image of Christ
They talk to the nothingness
Old wounds were never mended
Something drops from the autumn leaves
Again it rains:
In a dry corner, salvation again declines
Sleep like a skull in the hard ground
Nothing for ears nothing for eyes
Without a shadow, waiting for nothing
The dark room, the moist tenement of earth
The cold kiss of release, great light
He was never man enough
In a world of cruel faces
He discovered that he was never man enough
He discovered nothing
Far above and beyond...
All in the name of god
The eyes refused to look ahead...
When we came through
The veil of the night
The fall of man
We gave you our hearts
The watcher
The sentinel
The God that took you away
Where ends our journey?
We slip away
And shadow falls
We gave it all
You found no god
Mankind will forever weep!
From the ashes he returns
Through the seal of the dark
He looks upon the enchanting moon
His lips are dry
And crave for human blood
Through all centuries
We see the horizon clearly
Deep in our hearts
Under the shelter of a tree
It lives in the well of time
The ancient dread of non-existence
Close your eyes, it leads the way
To the Treasure throne of memories
This is the emptiness
This is life
Make a final sign
And Leave the world behind
A young catholic nun
Fucked up by a stun-gun
Life will not be like before
Scream, you Christian
Whore
Shoot it out
Don't resist
He'll Sodomize
He'll slit your wrist
You are a fragile flower
So innocent and pure
Feel it in your bowel
Calls tight rectums bleeds for
Sure
Crying out
In misery
Stinging pain
Gather the hordes of hell
Gang Bang virgin Mary
666 Seconds in hell
Destination death
Crucified through the wrists
Naked teenage tits
Diabolical religious fanatic
Heavy downer pills and
Heroin addict
You have met the devil
A devil in disguise
Diabolical destroyer
Just Look into his eyes...
This is a little bonus
For the Perverter of the soul
Bleeding from the anus
Now you're stiff and cold
Bleed!
I am possessed!
Enough is enough
You're going down
We're destroying all
Holy ground!
This is hell, this is war
Death, torture, bloodshed
And gore...
Still burns the church
Of faith
I am possessed!
The lack of faith is your,
Followers of the parasite god.
Eternal death and suffering
We embrace the knowledge
Of Satan!
Defending the throne of evil
The black frame burns
I am the voice of evil
I am possessed
Possessed!
Maximum evil power
Blood-smeared face of death
Cold mega engines of
Madness and hell!
The fury of a thousand deaths
Bloody fucking nekro hell
Blood-fuelled machinery
Conqueror of god
Bloody fucking nekro hell
Satanic poison death
Lungs filled up with vomit
You crawl knee-deep in shit
And gore
The engines is crushing more
And more.
I am the hell-commander of sin
Maximum evil satanic power
Bloody fucking nekro hell
Freezing rain pours down from
The clouds
Roar of a distant thunder
Awakes my thoughts
As we ride towards the
End of our fate
Our horse are carrying us
Through the winterland
Dark Medieval War!
The mild breeze are getting
Stronger
My hands grabs the frosty
Sword
Through the vast winter
Landscape
As we enter the kingdom
Of the unknown
With hate, death and pain
Deceitful eyes!
War of chaos and thundering
Rage
Our hands are open to welcome
Their death
As our sharpened weapons
Collide
Into the battle we ride!
After the anger the silence
Began
And now, the cold night
Approaches
From the top of the winter
Mountain
To ride with glory and
Armageddish anger
With hate
Can you hear the sound of an enormous door slamming in the depths of Hell?
The possibility of Life's destruction
Can you hear the cries of pain, the mournful sound?
The possibility of life's destruction
Can you hear the sound of an enormous door slamming in the depths of Hell?
The possibility of Life's destruction
Face of the Goat in the Mirror
Eyes Burn like an October Sunrise
As Once they Gazed upon the Hillside
Searching for the Memories.
In the Shadow of the Horns
Only seen by the Kings
Of the Dawn of the First Millennium
Upon the Thrones
In the Shadow of the Horns
Cleansed like the air in the Night
World Without End
we've become a Race of the Cursed Seeds
For five United Forces
In the Eternal Dawn
The Kings that held their heads high
The Triumph of chaos Has Guided our Path
We Circles the holy Sinai Our Swords Gave Wings
Invisible force of our Abyssic Hate
Our seeds Boil as we gaze upon the New Millennium
Weeping by the Graves of the Glorious Ones
so the hardened Frost Melts Away
Clouds Gather across a Freezing Moon
I kiss the Goat
Witchcraft Still Breathes
I'm in league with Satan
I was raised in hell
I walk the streets of Salem
Amongst the living dead
I need no one to tell me
What's wrong or right
I drink the blood of children
Stalk my prey at night
Look out beware
When the full moon's high bright
In every way I'm there
In every shadow in the night
I'm evil in league with Satan
Evil in league with Satan
I'm in league with Satan
Obey his commands
With the goat of Mendes
Sitting at his left hand
I'm in league with Satan
I love the dead
No one prayed for Sodom
As the people fled
I'm in league with Satan
I am the masters own
I drink the juice of women
As they lie alone
I'm in league with Satan
I bear the devils mark
I kill the new born baby
Tear the infants flesh
My cold goddess of the night
Squirming under my spiked fist
She's giving me all carnal delights
Submit yourself and drink my blood
I am the bringer of hate
Evil reigns supreme on earth
Defenders of the blackest faith
Which strengthen my inner glow
Mind expanding inner journey
From a grim and bitter soul
Misanthropic violent hellblast
It's darker than you think.
For seemingly endless time
There is still blood on the old oak
This is where you come to die
Over three hundred years old
And still stretching towards the sky
The hangman's oak.
Burning, bleeding, dying
From the inside
Hitting, whipping, kicking
The corpse of Christ!!!
Reading, learning, seeing
All knowledge of evil
Watching, waiting, observing
My fallen angel...
I am the mortal guide
With spiritual possessions
I have seen the other side
And I have sold my soul!
I have no earthly tombstone
And I have no christian grave
I am a misanthrope
I am not a fucking slave!
Evil surrounds you, channelling hell
Through the seal.
The only answer lies within
Beholder of all sorrow
The root of damnation, eternal dedication
The night closes in
Dark and cold
Life is an abyss
Profound as a thousand nights
Through the seal of the dark
A journey through the bleakest mist
Evil surrounds you
The presence of death
The gates to madness
Channelling hell
The only answer lies within
Over the ice-cold fjords
Under the wind-swept mountains
The deepest of all forests
Where darkness lies unknown
A layrinth of trees
Grown on the most unholy soil
Forever in darkness
I have touched the hands of death
Beholder of all sorrows
And the well of all human tears
The root of damnation
Suck the marrow of the fucking bone
Eternal dedication
We, brotherhood of the blood
Beholder of all sorrows
And the well of all human tears
Centuries have strengthened his soul
He knows the winds
He knows the woods and the trees
Firmly held by the strongest chains
He's waiting for the nightfall
He lurks in the evening mist
An earthly demon-made soul
Declaring destruction of god
Destruction and war
Hhe lurks the travellers to their death
He put a nail in your coffin
Forever and ever till the end of time
And he will always be
On top of the world!
Our lifeless faces of death
You will walk the darkest path
And find no inner peace
The blackest light of true evil
Torture me with a thousand razors
Torment me no further, kill me now
This is the day of suffering
This is the day I see you die
Get me out of this fucking hellhole
I can't stand the fucking smell
I can't stand your hypocrisy
You're going to hell
Living in fear, your death is tailor-made
Drowned in a pool of snot, tears and misery
You haven't seen the light
The christians were wrong!
There is no comfort in dying
There is no peace in death
You are worth nothing
Put to sleep like a sick animal
Overhead the thunder cracked and roared
And when it ceased the deathlike silence
Chilled my marrow and bones
The need to feel dead was killing him
Like death itself
Evil is found in the earliest
Oldest and the most dreadful
Memories of humanity
Eternally feared by gods primitive men
Pale visions, death-pale they were all
Still cursed, haunted and alone
Killing woman, children and men
Sparing neither age nor sex
A place where reality is worthless
And all you want is to be left alone
They grind the land like corn
Showing no mercy
Spilling the blood like rain
Devouring their flesh and sucking
Dry their veins...
The undead leaves their graves
In misty transformations
You see half-visible bodies
Floating through the night
The ancient spirits of the underworld
All the trees were lifeless and dead
And there were no birds singing
The reign of man is over
Drained for all its powers
He saw their starving lips shake
With a horrid grin gaped wide
And the corpse lies on the cold hill side
His spirit is carried away
By the northwinds into eternity
I walk the path of death
Which no one will return
I will lead you to this path
And see you burn
The only guiding light
The blackest light
To you who seek the knowledge
I will spill your fucking blood!
Follow me through this earthly hell
And lay thy hands on his horned skull
And worship!
The fallen angel of doom
Faster, faster
We're heading towards total disaster
My father is fire my mother is hate
Nourished with the blood
That blackened my hellish faith
Poisoned by the christian earth
Baptized by priest at birth
I command and follow lucifer
As the only representative
Living force... 
Lucifer!
The blackest light of evil
I have the knowledge
Spilling my blood!
I fell first amongst the angels
Who despise jesus christ
And all other heavenly creatures
Of the so-called heaven
The age of the moon
That should be observed by
All of the true heathen blood
I expect no less!
Spill the blood of the fucking lamb!
A shiver creeps down my spine
As I wander through these hordes
And when these callous arm
Streches out for me, I feel at home
You are the beholders of silence
Still your voice of wisdom means more to me
Than the words from a thousand men ever will
In a time with religious whores
Which keeps fucking the same cock
I gasp for air, you are my shelter
A forthcoming winter-night
From one of your mighty arms
I will hang in a rope
I am you, and you are the earth!
Your presence is indispensable
For the existence of life
Your elegy in stormy nights
One with the earth
And one with death!
As the decades and centuries rolled by
Most of the christians no longer thought
That the second coming of christ
Would take place in their own lifetime
They firmly believed
The awaited return of jesus christ
To earth in order to judge
The living and the dead
But they thought its possible
That these holy events
Might not come to pass
For hundreds or thousands of years
On the basis of a complex numerical
Calculations involving the symbolic
Interpretation of the so called
Book of truth
Still the preachers of our modern age
Which prophecies claimed true
Admit and coness your pathetic sin
Then you kneel and let the brainwash begin
The world will be swept by war and plagues
All evil will control humanity
Many will follow the beast 666
And take up arms against christ
The battle of armageddon is near
Apocalypse pestilence war famine and death
The demons of finality
From the sky they came
As written in biblical times
The vision of the destruction fo earth
The future is dark and violent
Carpathian Forest wants you dead, DEAD!
He lives in a old house on the hill
This elderly man of dark secrets
Haunted by the memories decades ago
Which shaped this man throughout his life
The old house on the hill
A call from hell
Far from people, he lives in the past
Alone by himself, always alone to the last
A saw, a drill and hammering on nails
The curtain covers the dusty windows
Scratching sounds and the sound of knives
Being sharpened from time to time
The old house on the hill
The old house on the hill
The nekrophiliac mental disorder
Cadaverous sexual deviations
An uncontrollable strong desire
Reading obsessively all obituaries
Dig up the recently deceased woman
And break into their tombs
Of the freshly buried sluts
And fuck them before they rot!
Dissecting the stiff and dead
Eating the eyeballs and the inside
Of her opened head
The infliction includes no pain
But the destruction of her
Innards and brain
Consuming the pieces of the corpse
Of someone who has been
Mutilated beyond recognition
A necrosadistical uncontrollable lust
There is much blood on the floor
Pus, entrails and stinking gore
Necrophiliac anthropophagus maniac
He needs to see her inside out
Necrphiliac
God-made sickening art
Ffrom her dismembered skill and head
Necrophiliac
Why don't you kill yourself
Slit, your wrists
Slit the right one
Now the left.
As a symbol for our end.
Hang yourself in the stairs.
Throw yourself in front of
An eighteen wheel semi truck.
Try to stick your pencils, up your nose
And smashing it into a table
Take a shotgun
And blow out your brain.
You're not using it anyway.
People Don't Care.
This is how life goes.
Take a heroin overdose
Your death is your extasy
And it beats lusting for me.
Why don't you kill yourself
Slit your wrists.
Hang yourself in the stairs.
Throw yourself in front of
An eighteen wheel semi truck.
Try to stick your pencils, up your nose
And smashing it into a table
Take a shotgun
And blow out your brains
You're not using it anyway
People Don't Care
This is, how life goes.
Take a heroin overdose.
From the ice-cold Norwegian Hills
From the silver mountain
And from My world I consider you Dead
I am born of Evil and Sin
And I always walked unholy paths
That you never seen or heard of
And I must fight the endless battle ALONE
You Freeze to death.
In morning mist.
Great vast landscapes, Frostbitten woodlands
Frozen thunder, Hellish blizzard storms
Here snow will always fall.
Black majestic Winter Magic
The evil frozen Moonlit Nights
Here exist NO fucking life! This is MY pandemonium!!!
The Unholy North
The Cold grip of Frost
Screams from tormented souls
Echoes in these towering mountains
The burning Pain is meant to last...
The direction of cold winds brings the putrid smell of Death...
All Heretics and Devils stand up and rides towards the Unholy Death...
Inhuman Coldness, Hellish winds
Black demons of the past
Norwegian Winter Hell...
Violent Battlecries, Perverted deathnoise
Victorious echoes of War, Death and Despair...
Candle life of own blood, and Heathen Heritage..
I got a desperate urge to slaughter
I have a sickening need to torture
I can die by no human hands
This unholy demon force
I was born to line the tombs of men
I am born of Satan and of sin
Black as a sculpture
Full winged on every cold night
Everyday I eat the fucking apple of Eden
Awaiting the destruction of the gods
I command you all to go out and slaughter
I command you fools to rape and murder
All for the glory of Him!
All for the glory of Hell!
Start up the incinerator
Here comes another useless fool
Who the fuck do you think you are?
Start up the incinerator
Here comes another useless fool
You must always live in sin
You must never help the weak
You must never feel guilt
And you live in the sorrow
And you live in the pain
And who the fuck do you think you are?
Start up the incinerator!
I embrace the cold Death..
With the burning Blade of Evil
The warm Blood on my hands
THE PENTAGRAM!
The trembling in your Christian knees
Liar, Weak is the Nature of Man..
What the hell are you waiting for?
Submit to SATAN!
Cut the flesh and submit to Death!
Whip and burn your skin
The Hellfire will burn deep within
Come Sodomy, Satan and Sin...
KILL GODDAMMIT, Let the war Begin!
Priests and prophets and the gospel of lies..
The Heaven shall burn, all humanity Dies..
I sin, I sodomize, I slaughter, I sacrifice!
SUBMIT!
Submit to SATAN!
Pervert you useless soul
My inner destruction demons
Hold high the black Inverted Cross!
Forever submit to SATAN!
SUBMIT!
Submit to SATAN!
Embrace the cold grim Death
The burning blade of evil
The warm blood on my hands
Hold high the black Inverted Cross!
Submit to SATAN!
SUBMIT!
Set the World ablaze!
KILL FOR SATAN!
Blood must be shed
Again and again
Sin after Sin!
Holt monumental Goat-Throne
Universal furnice...
The triumphant flame of SATAN!
DIABOLISM..
Unholy blood has been offered
and again I tap my Vein
My blood is eternally yours
I will give my life to you!
Everyday I must SUFFER
FUCK OFF and let me bleed.
I laugh and spit at your mortality
Because I know there is NO heaven.
As Violent Hellstorm returns
The cold Winds of Madness from the Dark human Abyss
Kill all meaningless Icons.
Be Condemned to Hell.
Step forth to the Devils Warfield
And see His world through possessed Satanic eyes...
I am the enemy of God!
And the purest fire burns within.
A hunger for Death!
The world Abyss!
You live like filth under your false Judeo God...
The first CUT.
A man-made Black Messiah!
I vomit on your compassion
Cause there is no salvation
This is maximum fucking hell
I cant fucking breath
I used to live a long life
Maximum fucking hell
A burn and destructive carnival
I vomit on your compassion
Jesus Christ come
Total evil, total hell
And time has showed no mercy on me
Understandable I feel the cold I feel the hatred
In the vast glorious nothingness I call human heaven
I'm going down! 
Down!
We're all going down!
Come on!
We're all going down!
I sing the sons of your meaningless death.
Death
You cant save you from your burning
You can feel the devil breathing
You can hear the loud voice of hell
And time have showed no mercy on me...
Let us all burn!!!
And time have showed no mercy on me...
Mercy on me...
I'm going down...
Down...
Come chaos, come death
Like a wolf, he is the hunter
Like an owl, belongs to the night
Like a serpent, his bite is deadly
Like a cunt, waiting to be fucked
waiting to be fucked
like a cunt waiting to be fucked
Like a blade, it makes you bleed
Like a bullet, it's meant to kill.
Like a war, he is majestic
Like a metal, I will stand, stand supreme.
I stand supreme!
Like a metal I stand supreme.
The darkest clouds are forming,
Remove my mask of serenity from my tortured face,
We are as one desire,
Beneath the infinity of the majestic sky,
Arise my darkest entity,
From the domain which I dwell,
Our time has come,
This is our kingdom,
We are the essence of warm winters.
Through the Darkening Tranquility,
the Entwining of Twin Passion in Deepest Love,
of one Vision of the Immortal Graveyard.
Centuries of Sleep on a Journey to my Rapture,
as I gaze up through Spellbinding Branches the Deepest Snow
falls thick Scorching into my Heart.
The most Supreme Vision of all, for the Sharpening of Deepest Midnight
in the Essence of Perpetual Winter...
is my Journey complete?
The Breeding of Witchcraft shall Consume the Night, to Unite as One
A Living Immortal Monument...
I hear my angel weeping silently amidst the graves
A glorious yet mournful veil, yet in whose name is she slain
Behind the truth the strength conceals twisted faith of Christian fools
The memoirs rekindled daylights last foray
Rekindled daylights last foray
A delicate balancing of two worlds
Embraced with the guardian death
The crest of our years somewhat fainted
Esteris, thy lingered opeth
Where two shores lay overlapped and time lay inter bracing
Many folds revealing facets, each for futures passing
The enochians of timeless earth
For thee, in sinful obscurity
Brought forth thy pleasures and languidity
I rise in amidst thy fear
To collate the precious faith and penultimate tear
To weave, thy starry ultimus
Set in gentle precious flame, nor to awaken us
Lemuria, at the edge of the graveyard
A lurid pale of seeking as she haunts in despair
I serve as the angel of death
Slept in dusk of the gravestones, in castles despair
Take grave solace in thy wisdom told
For the centinal alone could only be so bold
Innocence succumb to grieving majesty
Light auroral incarnations of sobriety.
From the darkest kaos from beyond this time
I shall free my wings as our souls align
Mortal barriers are falling in crippling time
In the moonlighting darkness, the garden divine
For invoking the dark, and the blood of its Lord
It shall punish the weak with its bestial sword
The innocent blood sacrificed in the night
Within darkness comes rapture in beautiful sight
Feel the midnight's pull
The answers to darkness and dreams in full
For only as eternity unfolds
Lie the secrets within a funeral toll
Slain by the hand too close to see
Prism in their eyes for eternity
Blessedly fading for all to see
Painting a picture of hypocrisy
Fraying at the edges of sanity
Beneath its surface a part of me
Unleash the tyrant from within
For no face can see beneath this opaque mask of deadened time
Image that emerges through the wrath and pain combined
Silken dreams of Avalon where shadows dwell for all time
As a demon I roar
Within the fabric of thoughts
My purpose an anchor
And exhale my spirit into the night air
Stained as I fall beneath my shroud
And my flesh anointing tribute to the proud
In a breath from an everless nightfall enshadowed thee
Fore I am forever as eternity chants its chivalry
As a silhouette in the night
Not of this world of within sunlight
Fore only as eternity unfolds
Lie the secret within a funeral toll
in the darkenss
I awaken
as once again
beneath the cover of the night sky
we indulge
in aliance of sathanas
the infinity
pounding at dawn
where shadows fear tread
as dark envokes me
I vow to thee
for my enemies shalt suffer
for we are the brave
I have eternity
in which we shalt dwell
dying
deep in the forest.
deep in the spell.
drink deep in the promise of the midnight
To dream of secrets, and desires in witch craft
Immortal, 
Salvation, 
I bleed the sky, 
for he rythes upon the cross, 
bleeding the Jewish lies
From the darkest kaos from beyond this time
I shall free my wings as our souls align
Mortal barriers are falling in crippling time
In the moonlighting darkness, the garden divine
For invoking the dark, and the blood of its Lord
It shall punish the weak with its bestial sword
The innocent blood sacrificed in the night
Within darkness comes rapture in beautiful sight
Feel the midnight's pull
The answers to darkness and dreams in full
For only as eternity unfolds
Lie the secrets within a funeral toll
Slain by the hand too close to see
Prism in their eyes for eternity
Blessedly fading for all to see
Painting a picture of hypocrisy
Fraying at the edges of sanity
Beneath its surface a part of me
Unleash the tyrant from within
For no face can see beneath this opaque mask of deadened time
Image that emerges through the wrath and pain combined
Silken dreams of Avalon where shadows dwell for all time
As a demon I roar
Within the fabric of thoughts
My purpose an anchor
And exhale my spirit into the night air
Stained as I fall beneath my shroud
And my flesh anointing tribute to the proud
In a breath from an everless nightfalll enshadowed thee
Fore I am forever as eternity chants its chivalty
As a silhouette in the night
Not of this world of within sunlight
Fore only as eternity unfolds
Lie the secret within a funeral toll
Fire of light, the ancients of dark night
Transcending through the war of passions delight
Feeding on the screams, a prelude to eternity's sigh
Shading like the trees, the gods are on their knees
How thouest darkness fills my dreams
I cannot forget the touch of winters breath
With infinity trapped in a sickening vale
Safe in their dark catatombs darkness unveiled
But a silhouette simply just like a shadow
Is shading the monument longing to overthrow
Ruins of Eden, savage of the demon
And shall spread his wings of eternity
Ripping forth through heaven and unto my dark angel
The fortress of this flesh is lonely and possessed
To a place where time and space are death
On a stagnant pool against the shores of Valhalla
In the presence of the shadows of Knell
They shall suffer in the fires of hell
Dark stagik forces and channelling fire
Fore here I am to walk in the garden of desires
Diabolus is rising forth to awaken the undead
Beyond the graves of shadows raging forth where angels fear to tread
Merely in an eye, of unholy sacrifice
Imprisoned for eternity
Lighting up the sky, the infant born to die
In darkening serenity
I am the dark living part of eternity veiled in the darkness
Breathing the chants hereafter
For deep in the woods I shall dwell in the stream of my languid creator
Dancing with fire in the moonlight
Dancing with fire in the moonlight
Within the bells of eternity chiming, darkness takes us still
We partake now each others indulgence, according to our will
The tears are the same as they struggle to blame
Congregation shall be burnt to the ground
For the fictions of insanity are holiest hypocrisy
Suffocating now without a sound
I hear you now from a thousand voids
Removed from time and timelessness
Where incarnations of simple nouns
Are beings each with golden crowns
Out beneath the open night
A wanderer lies weeping
In some unspoken sadness
While her dream is oversleeping
Her dreams ablazed with accursed fire
Of regret and eternal vigils
Hallowing nights, temptations lust
Compiled of satanic sigils
Death will come as sudden
By the magik of our Coven
The ultimate horror is told
I stand alone and solemn
In the presence of Amon
I am sacrifice slowly going cold
Dreams ablazed with accursed fire
Of regret and eternal vigils
Hallowing nights, temptations lust
Compiled of satanic sigils
Out beneath the open night
A wanderer lies weeping
In some unspoken sadness
While her dream is oversleeping
Demand the dreams macabre
The danse macabre
Slaying souls, danse macabre
From within and still unscarred
I stand alone and solemn as thy distant lights frey to death
And all around fore none as demon shall be found
Out beneath the azrael
Tolling raven of the knell
And to my dark angel
Whose form too vast to comprehend
As demons rise and re-ascend
Here is were evenings serenades
Amidst the dawn as gracious slaves
For my words are without sound
Far beyond and well renown
Centuries of dusk in time
Bleeding shadows of thy shrine
Within, thy darkness frey born of kaos in decay
Reaping shadows unto thee
A gracious death for all to see
As infinite avails
The human race that never fails
Played upon thy calming heart
Eyes of terror bleeding hard
That I doth control thee
Leading southward to the key
Hanging from the brances frail
Queen of darkness to unveil
Where whispers charm thy emptiness
And pierce thy tenous membrane
That striketh through my anguished heart
And tainted skys, where once demons remained
As the silent darkness breeding
Winters hate in silouettic sky
Stained with blood of an ancient slumber
With such a passionate melancholy
Of ages past and times to come
Shall speak in sound and slay in tongues
And spirits chanting satans hail
As darkness falls unto thy veil
Between in death thy black spirit
From thy pain we shall commit
Sleeping shadows demons fray
From beyond in massacre's pain
Fore thou art draped in sin
Amidst the shadows I have been
And seek the silent sentinel
On battlefields where they fell
Desire rekindles thee
Nearer than infinite
The dying scent of fragrant death
Fore spell of winter I possess
That I might dream thy pain
Invoke to tee like dragons slain
A lullaby like song of grave
Caressing shadows, demons slave
Fore thou art beautiful, fore thou art bright
Flashing thy splendour amidst the midnight
Thou canst not flee, mine shalt thou be
Of all enchantment
Thou shalt a goddess be
Give me the art of cheating and deceiving of thy dreams
May each and all become the death of ancient winter screams
Thus on her knees shall bequeath
The cold, cold moon writhes under
What thou desirest thou shalt obtain
As the war begins, Jehovah be slain
Darkness seeps upon abyss
Shall victimise the serpents kiss
Feast and drain thy goblet deep
A silence torn unto defeat
I wait for thee of killing spree
The soul and pain both unredeemed
As silence burns in witching hour
As thou wilt seek to hear them scream
Since thou hath made thy offering
The truth be known of evening spring
Who the chase by night preferest thee
Misfortuned deemed uncertainty
Thou who wakest in starry slumber
Of the stars and of the moon
The wolven screams of thy desire
Of the horn thyself the huntress
Huntress of the night forseen
Of cloaking blackness too obscene
Although our sight
The dance in flames for thy slumber 
The bestial sunset black at dawn
As I embrace thee
The dark god and I will keep thee safe
Scream to us in terror
Fore darkness is the essence of revenge and all mortality
I am the ending before life begins again
Ritualised as darkness falls to call the unbeleivers
Satan majesty of night shall punish its deceivers
Thou art immortal reign of terror and seductive pain
From the darkness
The moon dwells I
And all chaos rise
Incantation breathe
Consecration be
The seasons are as one derived
I pour my soul as nocturnal wine
Who would break thy hallowing point, as darkness neverending of mist
between, we shall be seen, and thus evil descending
The seasons are as one derived
Of chaos and eternal shrines
From ashes of their ruined eden
Cloaked and veiled we follow demon
Thou art aged in tribulation
Silent, dark, forbidding one
Of every aeon of lore within
Bleak with the shadows and captured in sin
As one or the other is ending this way
To bring shame on the fools who have nothing to say
Deep in the shadows I learned how to curse
Fore the ending is nearer than that of the earth
The lenght of their suffering prolonged in time
As dreaming of winter becomes a new shrine
Forgotten, forlorn in ebony I drown
As king of the night and darkness I'm crowned
In chapters of kaos and magik within
Shall repent all my sorrow and indulge in sin
The seaons are as one derived
As chaos falls and eternal shrines
Who wouldst break thy hallowing point as darkness neverending
Of mist between, we shall be seen, and thus evil descending, thou art
immortal reign of terror and seductive pain
Interlaced within your rapture
Wrapped in twighlight from hereafter
So that you might know the flavour of that desire
Destiny through dreams of sorrow
All life ends weak and hollow
And cannot know your tears of light shall remain
The skys alone told tales of fire
Conspiracy of pain and desire
Raping heavens to the thunders roar
taste the languid sweetness of my love
For revenge of fire on heaven
Of what has been left within
And the chaptered pain of horror
Deeply sighs and spreads her wings
You shall hear me with your ears
That are deaf to spoken tongues
Enchanting all forsaken
Voices poisoning their lungs
And to be spoken forever
In webs of enshadowed destiny
They do not penetrate the conscious mind
Reflecting sanity
Drawing all life and light into them
Leaveth thou in their turmoil draining again
The sound of emotion, thy thunderous heart
And tethered forever in your thoughts from afar
Beneath the veil of tears they wear
They see not clear enough to care
Darkness seething avalon, fore skys reap death and heavens tear
And speak in tongue of secrets told
Of spirits kindred, bought and sold
A kingdom beneath a veil of dark shalt remain
Your velvet skin in breath of sorrow
A token of thy graveless honour
Fore thou art the touch of death like winters sigh
And to remain in this forever
Draped in darkness here together
So many dreams but never sleeping
Anguished pain, eternal weeping
Thy souls in flames of anger, and cruelty cradle thee
In times of war and dragons lore, unleashing unto me
Deepest red born winter, for none so dark as thou
With kaos as its figurines, and monuments of stone
Invoke to thee, dark majesty silence told in darkness breathe
Shall soak with blood in secrets told through forests dusk of putrid dreams
Stained with blood our seal shall be alive
Suffering, indulged in sin as flesh and fire are one within
Raping heavens to the thunders roar
Bring forth the circle and the skys we shall command
And deathly haunting avalon forever in this land
With hate embracing vengeance of power on thy seal
Shall blessedly affect their death, enchanting all surreal
Blackening chaos ripping through my soul
Beneath souls of infinite light, as darkness falls upon all
As invocations of terror and destruction
Condemn and deny those of feeble weakness
Upon the altar
Darkness destroy thou
We are of winter
Release seals of death
All about this ruined tomb, fragment silence of forever
Dreaming ancient winters in the moonlight
SIlence of forever drowning
And fall, embrace me to the sun
And failed to wake, to be then forsaken
As gardens die and heavens shake
We are the silence of forever burning bright
Darkness, crawls in all eternity
As fear be their martyr
Draped in darkest ebony
Upon the altar darkness reaches through my soul
Enchanting in the garden be thy kingdom on the throne
Dark satanic majesty, give unto me the seal of the damned
So that I may conjure thee, as infinity burns
The reflections of deepest emotion burning within
Death and all avalon awaiting, as blackness surrounding,
Immortality prevail in emotion... in emotion...
Anoo nomine satanas nightfall...
In the name of the dark one
And wash away this sweet despair
I give all that I am to you
For reasons they cannot quite discern
Somewhere deep within the night
Darkness chimes in justice
Reasons for armistace
Unaware, between thy values of grace
Freedom yet inferno
Spiting all incarnal
Ever so silent the graveridden kiss
Breaking in mercy, shall fall to thy knees
As kaos damnation, spreading its wings
Through winds of salvation our sorrow doth share
And armed with the seals of blackness we wear
Woven silken darkness from thy dreams
the ancient queen
Thy paleness still bequeathed
And shadowing thy nest of dawn
Beneath the throne we shall redeemed
We shall redeem our nature
In shadows that I cast is yours
Of spinning visions of other shores
Fore art reflecting deeming night
And shall reside in candlelight
Alive, come forth, thou art in yearning
Irrevocably their worth
And certain guardians of the gates
I am the living part of death
And so beyond understanding of thee
Unleashing darkness gripped in light with fury
Wrapped in purpose yet with everything to see
Darkness bestowed unto thee
And shall declare thy living breath
For none so certain to cheat death
As the scarlet and amber, peers in through forsaken
Thy gravelessness whisper remains
Where time can never dwell in this solitary hell
Even though we are free of its chains
For I am not as once I was
I yearn to search and watch return
Meeting shadows, seasons tare
As once they roamed without a care
The blood and wine, for art divine
All mist in seething, never sleeping
As I wait in thy rapture, the sound of our laughter
Sword in my hand I shall arise
For darkness in waiting, prevail and forsaking
Enshadowing evil divine
From an evergreen land where the lore shall command
The patrons of right shall remain
And dwelleth forever int he lands of the nether
Be found in trains of nightmare thy darkness remains
A precarious entity subjected to change
A yearning expressed sprung through tales of death
As infinity unites, with kaos we remain
For centuries of dark shall crack open the moonlight sky
This mournful sound as darkness falls upon thy face
I cannot see beyond the haze that distorts thy shadow
beneath of terrible slaves
And wouldst thou trade thy dying soul
For the life that burns
That a thousand lifetimes be hidden in frost
Held captive forever for the war they've lost
Draped in sinister pain, only terror remains
And the scarlet forsaken be hidden in shame
To a place of ancient splendour
I returned to moments night
To catch the lightning in your eye
And tame it with a lullaby
Darkness falls upon thy face
All figments of the human race
It is as if I've always known
For none but them the overthrown
Deep in the shadows the prism is thine
And death lying waiting within horned god sign
The graves lying silently seeping their worth
As creatures, as warriors once roaming the earth
Destiny of ancient sorrows
Falls through shattered dreams
That pierces like a lightning bolt
Re-kindling thy darkest scream
Ancient, of dawn
For none so art like him, as I am darkness spawned
Releasing shadows as we fall, I am your empath
Slowly growing pale, capturing the dusk in sin
Darkness, breathes superior, swallowing the moonlight sky
As fate within thy destiny that came to life in one black night
Faith in all the keepers of our legend
Death intertwined and embracing all time
All figments eluded that practically shine
Have faith in your warriors, weak as their worth
And slain in amusing satanical curse
And upon my word we shall unite
Heeding eternal blackness
For none so like him as us
As deepest storms roll
And falling rain on to thy face
Remember me as king upon the throne of pain
And midnight of hunger ripping forth with hate
As vengeance chimes thy fate
Upon an altar, a song played upon the wind
As covens, indulged in sin
Lie about the afterlife
Seeking people who are weak
Only your ideas are right
It's you who are the weak
Not nearly a close second
Your race eradicated
Transferred to the light of obscurity
Your soul wanders endlessly
Invoking blessings
through my prayers
Praising gods
evil spirits
For my blessings in disguise
Kings of chaos
evils rise
Impurity running through my soul
Unholy blood running through my veins
An aura of darkness
Surrounding me
I am born 
I'm eternity
From the darkness
We've destroyed thee
Our times here
Conquest complete
Blackest of angels come for me
Sin my soul for eternity
Give me the power to oversee
The fall of Christianity
Too afraid to change your ways
Worried about God's damnation
A religion full of flaws
Now you see it's Satan's cause
From such early days on
I always knew there was a difference
Unlike so many others
Their bigoted minds
Discriminated constantly
But we'll eventually see
What the future holds
I am ready to die
So called Savior
Watch my ascension
So called Savior
See my elation
The seeds were planted
During the formative years
But I saw the truth
I saw the lies for what they were
Its just a dying pity
You couldn't do the same
You irrelevant life
Has no meaning at all
So called Savior
See my elation
So called Savior
Watch my ascension
Now your falling
How your falling
You stand silent
You keep silent
and angels wither and die
Death raining from the sky
The sheep are now with warning
Miasma all around
Air thickens with fear
Death grows near
All blanketing me
All I see
The flock they are restless
They lead to the way
The way of the doomed
Leading them all astray
Into the miasma
One my one they'll slay
Destroying deceivers
Starting a new day
New day emerges
Dark new era
New day emerges
Feel the power
Dark new era
New day emerges
Aura filling all around
One by one without a sound
Beckoning towards their death
Holy flock one final breath
And it destroys all the deceivers and betrayers without mercy
The evil inside is the ultimate power
A new day emerges
The morning mist beckons
It calls out my name
The morning miasma
Leaving all slain
It raped all their virtues
It raped all their hopes
Destroyed all their dream
Destroyed all that false
Behold after silent prayers
Changing the souls direction
By praising those of the dark
A new strength emerges
A strength designed with hate
Controlled to destroy all enemies
And now your time has come
Your futures non existent
And the voice says do it
Raging
Seething
Waiting
Should I?
Waiting
Seething
Raging
Before the dark paved the way
A darkened heart shaded grey
As time elapsed transformed jet black
Now's the time ready for attack
Ready for attack
Feel the nails tearing through flesh
Gasp for air 
ribs collapsing
Wear the crown
unworthy holy
Feel the pain
all unholy
Your pain is my pleasure
You suffering is my delight
Wear the crown
unworthy holy
Feel the pain
all unholy
Thank you dark lords my soul I shall give
My strength from you, my will to live
My path is chosen I've seen the way
The hatred inside that wont go away
Thank you dark lords my soul I shall give
My strength from you, my will to live
My path is chosen I've seen the way
The hatred inside that wont go away
The clouds gather
The dark skies loom
The thunder claps
A life filled tomb
Life filled tomb
The earth that we once knew
Defunct, desolate in view
Disease and death abound
This era I am crowned
The mortals run in fear
Their lives soon disappear
Saved from a life of lies
Silenced but for their cries
But for their cries
Now I'm crowned
Just as I saw, by his Majesty's law
Now I'm crowned
Lifeless 
extinct
I'm alive but dead, awake but asleep
As friend gather round and mourners they weep
My mind thinks of all the things I have done
My body is cold but my heart beat goes on
And on and on
As they lower me down into that hole in the ground
I scream out for help but they hear not a sound
I fear at the lid, my fingers they bleed
Is this happening to me or is it just a dream
Summon the dead.
Baphomets call.
Blood on my hands.
Let me out of here
My bones are decayed, my flesh it doth rot
I'm lying in silk, take the lid off this box
My lungs gasp for air, my eyes scream for sight
I promise the rise of my body this night
Summon the dead.
Baphomets call.
Blood on my hands.
Screaming in torment.
I'm felling you all.
Take heed of my plea.
Answer my call.
I'm gonna be free.
I awaken
Apprehension and excitement engulf me
For today is the day
The expedition of indulgence
How long have I waited
My voyage to be the soil of sin
Knowing of delights untold
Thoughts are racing, mind reflecting
Time becomes non-existent
To the soil of sin I long to be
Where my black heart can now lie
Lost, lost, I struggle to find my way
Roaming the land I seek the unholy ground
Panic, panic, lost, lost
Lost in a place I know not of - Limbo
I see the light
Attracted I venture closer
Knowing of my earthly delights
Home is the soil of sin
Torn from the shadows drawn into my head
The powers I seek have been stolen from the dead
From being watched I take control
The temple of perversion shall be my home
I see them
the demons
That grimace just for me
The powers they bestow upon me I embrace
Watching over my sacred soul all my life
Saved by the evil that controls all my life
Perversity
blasphemy
atrocity
humanity
Sacrifice human life
Slaying all in my sight
Now as I see I can be what I am
Blasphemy in my eyes, blasphemy in my life
Now as I see I can be what I am
Angels cry, demons rise for my soul
Take control
Night draws near
I appear
For his life you now fear
Cloaked by the dark, taking form
hidden
In the shadows I do dwell
hidden
As the holy son rests peacefully
Totally unaware of my being
His life now in my hands
His life is worthless
The time to alter the future is almost upon me
Altering
Now you die
how you cry
Worthless life now destroyed
Day appears 
no more fears
no one hears
As you hang upon the cross
The lies are already there
More of an unholy cult
The face of betrayal
No real truths, just more lies
Millions sucked in
How could a man of love let this happen?
How could a man of love be this deceitful?
How could a man of love not giveth?
And how could a man of love taketh away?
You are not my lord - pathetic illusion
Preaching self-deceit, not a fiber of truth
I see your face - I vision the true evil
I see a waste of what life is
Fuck you Jesus Christ
You are no lord of mine
Lies,
In the end you can't disguise
What awaits you all and I
The truth is before your eyes
The gates open wide
Sinners, lost souls, bastards, join us now
Why?
Lead on by your faith, you're blind
The secrets you've kept will blind
You with the horde riding high
Your fate lies with me
Stand tall
Slaughter, kill them all, blood on my hands
Have no fear, as your death is nigh
The waves of hate reigning down
Man's wrath, as old as time
Relish in blood of me
No more Christian, no more Muslim
Kill religion
Kill the mother and the father
Kill the priest
If you believe, that we are all sinners and going to hell
As fire, raging, burning, hate runs through me
Release thy demons
Years of holdbacks, years of strife
Some wasted time, some wasted life
A look to the future for all positive thoughts
The past is exactly that
Right here
right now
A coiled spring
Against the odds, against the grain
Like the worm, halved but alive
Immortal thoughts
We are here to stay
Now and forever
The truth is revealed, encased for all to see
The shining delight
A monument to longevity
See them run from this place
Through the dark, no escape
I am here, and I rule now
Lives are perished, life is cherished
Beautiful sights
I am here and I rule now
Join me my brothers in my dark ways
The future is bright and gone are the gray days
The last of the sheep are finally hunted
No more remaining and no more wanted
The earth now finally cleansed of the scum
No more the weak, the afraid and the dumb
The planet of Satan my work now done
The cross is inverted, believe holy son
The earth now finally as it should be
No more the reign of hypocrisy
The planet of Satan now rebuilt by me
The cross is inverted - eternally
You cannot deny an eternal belief
Within my mist filled eyes, utopia lies
Look through my vacant stare
I yearn to wonder there
I shall now rise above you all
Passion inside to destroy
Yet through these years I have stayed too long
I hate today again
You won't break me
Through these eyes, I won't cry
With these hands, I must fight
All I'll give is the hurt that you gave to me
It's but only time
Hold unto me what's mine
Fuck you and your kind - evermore
It is coming
Your venom won't stop us
Our onslaught relentless
They have tried, they won't win
The passion is too deep
We return
The mind war rages
Truthful thoughts deemed inappropriate
Silence is golden
The path to a peaceful world
The way of the weak
Incompetence is all I see
As much use as your dead god
It's no wonder I fucking hate
Like a cyst you grow, soon to be cut off
Cut off from your mortal coil
I understand how the mind war rages
I choose misanthropy
this is my name
I choose misanthropy
this is my peace
Without solitude a real war would rage
However mortal laws in power
The beast must be tamed for now
But soon enough I will unleash my grand finale
My visions of what soon shall be are dark and sinister
My visions of what soon shall be are devastating in effect
Perishing, withering
Mind unable to comprehend
A temporary state or euphoria
Brought on by all the mentally wrong
The last brick in the window
All light is shunned
A new consciousness now born
One of warm content
Grinning with glee, all that I see
No pain, no misery
Pathways exposed, mind explored
For what cost?
Sanity escaped
Brain malfunction
Overriding imagination
Nothing is right, all is wrong
I feel like hell itself
For every good deed there is an evil
Will I remember tomorrow?
Or is this another life?
The invaders come for me
Foretold in revelations
Untruly lost for words
And caught somewhere in time
The prophecy that I have seen
Is the silent assassin
Brain malfunction
Screams of the goddess
Echo through me, my soul torn
Unending, deathless
The memory of illusionary thorns
Awakening beneath the cursed ground
Rising through the depths of lifeless stone
Ancient cruelty, forgotten beauty
Intertwined through satanic litany
Monarchs of destructions
Shall blot out the barren stars
Reigning for untold aeons
Upon thrones of shadow
A new age dawns above
The blackened earth
The weak shall tremble
All shall fall before our wrath
Death to the tribes of Judah
I shall exalt in their demise
Awakening beneath the cursed ground
Final voice of prophecy
Ancient cruelty, forgotten beauty
Resurrected eternally
I shall fear no enemy
Before your malign faces three
Dark mother of witchcraft
At the crossroads shall we meet
Blind to the wisdom that hides within
The face of the baleful azure sky
Mysteries bound beyond counting
Within infernal sanctuaries
I reach out to grasp the shackles and
tear them from my withered skin
Awake now from this slavery
Taste of this infinity
To destroy the bloody chains
To deny the pillars of being
Primordial chaos incarnate
I wander through the heavens' vastness
All before me shall I lay waste
Unto the end of all
All before me shall I lay waste
As I apporach the heavens' gate,
slaked in the blood of christ,
I embrace this damnation,
flood my body with divine scorn
Paths wrought from the skin of angels
Alone shall I walk
Through the empyrean
And so I descend to
The silent watchers
Beyond the gates of dawn
A sickness is breeding here
Within the soils of this world
Creation reduced to tarnished silver,
Accumulation's hollow child
Following greed sullied parables
They build on works of corruption
Raising the towers of Babel
On the backs of mindless men
Cleansing flame shall descend
The burning tongues of Phlegethon
In the name of our dark lord
Shall their blood feed the river's flow
Staring into their eyes
Nothing but emptiness
My blade shall be answer
As it falls through their flesh
Your gold and silver is tainted
And their rust shall bear witness
Your lives and deeds wasted
And your legacy is dust
The blood of billions stains the earth
None shall escape the fires
Of the infernal goddess' kiss
Humanity scattered,
they march into the abyss
Auguries of disease have
finally come to pass over this world
In clouds rampant pestilerous death
raining down from the skies
Crowds gasping for air as
the abhorrence takes hold
I am as one with the pestilence,
bestowing this final gift
Sewing contagion amongst
the helpless flock
Mercilessly I am scourge
to man and beast alike
Their feeble shepherd writhes,
his skin blistered and cold
I am the death of God,
plageous black salvation
The earth I defile
Extinction of the human race
Satan's will unfurled
Plagued by black death
Poison seeps through the veil,
the absence between the worlds
Plunging doomed the
lands into eternal night
Power unrivalled,
anticosmic darkness unbridled
Purification through all
pervading nightfall's vines
Plagued by black death
As the seraphim cease their song
With the heavens collapsing around them
Behold, the emptiness of the lightless sky
Behold, the majesty of pestilential death
Behold the emptiness of the lightless sky
A vast unmoving expanse
Behold the majesty of pestilential death
And the contamination of all life
As the visions burn.
As my skin turns cold.
I clench my bloodied fist
And the knife carves my wrist
Wracking my body
In ecstasy
Liberation in extremis
Reflected in mirrors
Despair's divine image
Crystal tained
Crimson flows
Liberation in extremis
Lost in the grip of euphoria
As my life's blood is shed
As the knife
Tastes flesh
Exalted broken wretch
Lost in the grip of euphoria
As my life's blood is shed
My will turned to hate
My malice turned to bliss
Nausea flooding my senses as
My wounds quiver and beg for more
here the sun rises
I will breathe no more
Suicide sacrifice
Abhorred truth of demise
No journey into the
Reachless skies
I see behind the screams
Bore into their stricken minds
Labyrinthine passages of smoke
Consumed by madness divine
Ecstasy from misery, unholy sorcery
Chance to recapture
Monarchy and cruelty, transcendent blasphemy
My virulent rapture
Mundane human suffering
Will not sustain me long
Inflicting my own terrors
Upon banquet shall I gorge
Ecstasy from misery, unholy sorcery
Chance to recapture
Monarchy and cruelty, transcendent blasphemy
My virulent rapture
Feeding on torturous horrors
My pain bloated face smiles
Parasite and the victim
Living is their only crime
Condemned to their tepid world
But on their pain I thrive
Infinite the moment for me
So old ravaged by time
Born and ruled as king
Now ermine swapped for rags
Dethroned and cast out
Their pain my pathway back
Condemned to their tepid world
But on their pain I thrive
Infinite the moment for me
So old ravaged by time
Ecstasy from misery, unholy sorcery
Chance to recapture
Monarchy and cruelty, transcendent blasphemy
My virulent rapture
Condemned to their tepid world
But on their pain I thrive
Born and ruled as king,
their screams my pathway back
How the time
Has worn on
Reflecting life
And future
Decisions made
Past and present
Where I stand
Is at the peak
And here I am ruler
And here I stand King
The right things done
Satan guides me
A life's worth more than life's worth to
You, king of the Jews
I learned your lies and I learned the truth
I learned your creed and I learned your noose
I learned your lies and I learned your ways
I saw your blood and I saw your death
I taught your lies and I taught my ways
I taught my kin and I taught him sin
I taught about hate and about intolerance
I spoke of honesty, I spoke of truth
A life more than, than your life
A life's more than a life's worth to
You, king of the Jews
Here in the dark of the godless depths
Eternally I dwell
Long ago forsaken to
Lie and burn in fire
Castigation my soul binds
To the demonic winds
I am born as the planets align
At long last unconfined
Subterranean swarm
Sulphurous hordes
Satanic carrion calls
Slouching towards War
Grant me their pain, grant me their unending suffering
As my legions carve through them in howling torment
Grasping for their skulls I kill, bodies fall before my will
I denounce their master as I walk over their corpses
I shall drink the messiah's blood and lay his arrogance low
His broken body pitiful sacrament to maggots
His effigies crushed to dust ,from this day abandoned
I shall destroy these mortal lands, razing them to the ground
And so I cast my arm to the North, and hell roams close behind
Raising high my throne adorned with entrails, flame and bone
Rejecting divine falsehood, I shall become the sun's bane
Through communion with the dark lord I shall rule this dominion
Grant me their pain.
As the sun sets I cast off
My waking flesh as it dissolves
Into ether the bonds that
Chain me here
Hear my call and guide my hand,
Hear these words of adoration
Blood of the witch awakens
Ever seeking promethean light
Illumination
Darkness' promise revealed
The eyes of Hecate
Tearing through the veil
Manifold are the mysterious
Blessings of the sevenfold curse
The key to immortality
Her insidious harvest
Down the generations I can feel her presence
Encircling my body claim my soul for your own
From the black, come forth
And light the roads to the underworld
Tear my skin and drink of my blood
Reduce me to nothingness
To know sheer antinomian will
To dare to lose yourself in it's depth
From the black, come forth
Cloak me and light the roads to the underworld
Lost is the straight path
To the edges of consciousness
Gates of horn and ivory
Crown a lake of bitterness
Wraiths line the fields of this hell
Consumed with vain regret
Blind worms ignorant
Of knowledge in the self
These madmen and lepers
Do themselves condemn
In dreams of abberration
Drowning insipid vermin
Is there nothing beyond?
Is there nothing before me?
Radiance of the void
Dis staring back at me
Purify the vessel
In darkness pain no more
Open my weary eyes
Smash the gates to the abyss
The only apotheosis is bloody tears
And the wretched laughter of the gods
Flame surrounds me
Raging columns burn
Circles of the dead
By the light of the seven pointed star
Hidden in secret ciphers and edicts of fire
Spectres reappear and fade
As I rend the branches
of the tree of death
Lost in sorrow and
forgotten desire
Sacred night enshroud my soul as
offering to the who
dwells beyond
I am become timeless amongst
you, as I embrace the silence
An hour away from home,
The lights come on.
Standing at the side of the road,
I am in awe.
Amongst the snow and trees,
The freezing cold,
I thrive on each sorrowful note.
For the moment, all is still,
A tranquil pace.
The ease of being stranded,
In this compassionate place
Amongst the snow and trees,
The air is cold and clean,
and for the moment, I am at peace.
Being able to enjoy a disaster
is a sham of being so optimistic.
Now that the thrill has worn off,
and the adventure has lost it's charm,
I just want to go home.
Still waiting at the side of the road,
The hours have passed, since I last moved.
Head down, eyes closed,
Into a suspended sleep I fall.
Then in sequence, from far to near,
Light reflects off of objects before...
A sun, of the darkest blues,
Rises from the hills behind...
To pass between, these winter walls,
While traveling at night,
Taken by reflection,
I mine my life
The trees have seen me come this way,
Many times at any hours.
They stand on both sides,
And greet me, as I pass.
A time and place, where winter begins,
I see inspiring sights.
Reminiscent of years gone by,
I mine my life.
I am, being expected,
by those who are waiting at home.
Taking caution,
knowing I'm guided by white lines covered in snow.
On occasion I pass through,
From the life I build,
To the life I knew.
Only the trees would have seen,
Who held the wheel.
Only they would have seen,
When I grew tired of travel.
Only the trees would have seen,
Who held the wheel.
Only they would have seen,
When I lost control.
In desperate times, in such desperation,
This long road traveled once left me behind.
Now used, for gaining momentum,
The theme of it all,
Defines my life.
Who knows how long I've stood here...
Or how many times.
I may wander, but I will return,
The same time each night.
For running water plays the score to this scene.
I stand and stare into the mirror.
This has become so familiar to me,
Because I no longer rest where I used to sleep.
A handful of water to cool your face
will be the only comfort you'll know.
So pick up your heart and run for your life.
To drain your body of all it's energy.
For heavy steps on a quiet path,
Is the sound of earning your rest.
Try to sleep
on the other side of the room.
Forget all the time you have lost
For it's the insight that kills you.
This night will end,
Only to begin again.
And nothing will change until the change of the seasons
Many months away.
The night is long,
Exhausted I make my way home.
As the earliest of those begin their day,
I finally begin to sleep.
This strain that resolves in me,
Truly has come at a cost,
For the rain, that falls on me,
Was drawn, from the sea of immeasurable loss.
A meeting place and time.
Our chance to make amends.
Weather to meet as planned,
Or reach out for, the cold, upper hand.
A meeting place and time.
Of which neither of them would show.
A meeting Place and Time.
A meeting place and time.
Pictured in our minds.
To stand up, from a table,
And prepare for the outside.
A meeting place and time.
Neither of them would show.
A meeting place and time.
Neither of them would know.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
with that having been said,
Could you be careful with your words,
Because my world is in your hands.
It was a year ago today,
I put a desperate man to death.
He was the man I used to be,
He trusted every word you said.
You can wait no more
it's time to go home.
I hope it's cold, everyday, where you are...
For this place, is where neither of us will meet.
For this time when neither of us will wait.
And this is the end of this burden of yours and mine.
This is the end, of this well rehearsed story of you and I.
This meeting place and time.
The story of you and I.
Drawing meaning from the unexpected,
A sign that cannot be denied.
A portrait of our everlasting expressions,
And the distance between us, side by side.
Nearing the end of this long discussion,
Still struggling for what more to say,
A man of words trying to argue his point,
With someone, who can afford to walk away.
This conflict of interest,
Of whether to act and indulge,
Or risk waiting for the greater gain,
That may never come.
I'm always pushing my luck,
for nothing is ever good enough.
While you strive to protect,
what you already have for nothing will ever be as good as it was.
A look held too long, or maybe not long enough,
in the perfect setting which complicates us.
While we await the inevitable end,
We enjoy the inevitable events.
For everyday that passes we lessen the risk.
For everyday that passes makes much more sense.
While we await the inevitable end,
We enjoy the inevitable events.
And now
a new tension,
This one of silence.
A late morning gaze out of the window,
from inside a cold apartment.
We look out, we look away,
Anywhere but at each other.
Sunlight shines
On the clothes that lay on a chair
A desk covered in clutter
The floor covered in hair
It shines on a figure, so thin and frail
It shines on his skin, so sick and pale
It shines on the wall, where for so long
I have stared
Breaking the spell of authentic despair
As my eyes come into focus
I turn to face to face the room
The movement from the sheets creates a breeze
Sweeps the dust from its place
It so quietly swarms
And hangs in the air
It shines in the light
And makes me aware
Death is looming in here
And it's getting to you
Under dust, over time
It has been burying you
It now stirs up the room
As it enters my sight
Rising up from the dark
From the surface it lies
As if hinting to me
To choose day over night
To leave all of this dark
And seek the warmth of the light
Outside this room where my life wastes away
Her priorities lie
In collecting corks from bottles she plans to make into things
I had built up all of my hopes and all of my plans
Only to have them stand and cast shadows of humiliation
Days would pass shadows would remain
A reminder of all of my dreams
I had to live humbled with
The disappointment of what never came to be
I vow from this day forward
My grieving will be brief
That I will continue to give to this world
Knowing I may never receive
I had come so far
Before being stripped and sent back to the start
It felt as though the air was tearing me apart
A hybrid of seasons had come
It swept across the land
It spared the lives of everyone else
While it destroyed everything I had done
The frost came in the night
My progress immortalized
All that I had left undone
Would be forever, frozen in time
I became known for this curse
It happened throughout my life
It needed to continue to occur
In order to keep my legacy alive
Before I know my time had arrived
It was already gone
Cursing the cold winds of change
My moment of peace was just the eye of the storm
The will to live is easy
You can exist without a care
The will to die shows it meant so much
That you couldn't have it
and you couldn't go on living without it
The will to give makes the best of nothing
It is a philosophy
That states you will continue to give to this world
Knowing you may never receive.
Satisfaction will come and in time it will leave us unsatisfied
As uncertainty returns
Bringing back the excitement to our lives
We can only enjoy so much stimulation
Before we stop responding and become despondent again.
I had built up all of my hopes and all of my plans
Only to have them stand and cast shadows of humiliation
Days would pass shadows would remain
A reminder of all of my dreams
I had to live humbled with
The disappointment of what never came to be
Those shadows still remain as landmarks of failed attempts
In their shade I work away at building a tower of character
One day it will be revealed and it will stand for man years
Casting a shadow of its own and striking fear in hearts as will I
It is the discomfort that sets us apart
That wakes us up, that puts us to sleep
It is our pathetic moments
Which make us desire to be great
It is the starving itself
That makes us hungry to want more
Over time as you learn to fall
You'll rise to your feet faster than the time before
Satisfaction is a peak on the verge of decline
It will be over in the blink of an eye
Take your time to feel every moment
A gradual climb will let you enjoy it
For your life is measured
By the degree of dynamic from your life to your death
The wait is long and the wait goes on
But it is better to travel hopefully than to arrive
Through the crests and troughs
I will have seen both sides
By the Pursuit of the Sun and the Allure of the Earth
I will have earned and spent my life
The will to give
There is no destination
There is only the journey
The sun was in my eyes
It blackened my sight
I was high with conviction
That I was invincible
The sun was in my eyes
I was stricken blind
I believed I could see through the dark
As I followed the un-guiding light
Pursuing the sun
While causes of mine are still alive
But barely carry on
Pursuing the sun
While friends lay in beds
Recovering from their recklessness
Give in to all the temptation
Give up on all your beliefs
Forget the feeling of the changing of seasons
Wishing that summer would go on forever
How long before it would get old
Would you miss looking forward to when it starts to get cold
The sun was in my eyes
It came through the trees
Consumed all of my mind
It was all I could see
The sun was in my eyes
Something became of my life
I left all else behind
And starred into the light
The sun was in my eyes
Putting it off for a rainy day
When it pours I'll stay indoors
To try to make things right
The sun was in my eyes
Thin ice on a summer's day
As I procrastinate
It falls apart and melts away
Pursuing the sun
While causes of mine are still alive
But barely carry on
Pursuing the sun
While friends lay in beds
Recovering from their recklessness
Going after the pleasures of summer
Betray the comforts of our dark little space
Believe their healing will cure all your trauma
Becoming the person you've claim to hate
True colors are shining through
Trading the black for the yellow, green and blue
The sun was in my eyes
It came through the trees
Consumed all of my mind
It was all I could see
The sun was in my eyes
Something became of my life
I left all else behind
And starred into the light
When summer came
I was overcome
Pursuing the sun and its hot summer days
On the long road on the way to the grave
The sun was in my eyes
It came through the trees
Consumed all of my mind
It was all I could see
The sun was in my eyes
Something became of my life
I left all else behind
And starred into the light
The sun was in my eyes
I could not see
Please find it in your heart
To forgive me
Pursuing the sun because you can
But still tell the night you'll still see each other now and again
Let him down softly, be polite
Reassure him all the same that things will be like they've always have been
A fragile boy
With needs on you he depends
Who measures how much
It all meant to you by how quickly you left
A fragile boy
With needs on you he depends
With your negligence
You have pushed him to the edge
It was the darkness that kept us together...
It was the light that led you away
You control our destiny
Reduce it back to an idea
I beg of you from agony
Please conform to decency
The sun was in my eyes
It came through the trees
Consumed all of my mind
It was all I could see
The sun was in my eyes
Something became of my life
I left all else behind
And starred into the light
The sun is shallow
It will shine for anyone
The night is loyal
Only to those who are true
Time will fly as you pursue the sun
But the night will be long and cold
And it will wait for you at home
When summer came
I was overcome
Something lost for something gained
Pursuing the sun and it's hot summer days
On the long, backstabbing back-road on the way to the grave
The sun taunts you
In everything you do
Like a substance that works for everyone else
But has no effect on you
It shines for places
You'll never go
It shines for people
You'll never know
You believe that in your entire life
You will never feel
What it's like
So you turn away
Dream about an escape
A hole in the earth deep and cool
That you could climb down into
I despise the rising
Of the upsetting sun
I'll hide away
Until the day is done
I'll exclude myself
A few months of every year
To avoid the drama
Of the sun, sweat and tears
You could fall away
And no one would know
Release the tension of holding on
Feel the high of letting go
So you turn away
Elude the pressures of the sun
Go find your place in the shade
Far away from everyone
It's so easy to get your fill
When the engine turns and pushes in the dirt
It's so easy to be satisfied
When all you want to do is lay down and die
The Allure of the Earth
Those dreams can come true
When you make a deal with the earth
Who says...
Here's what I can do for you...
The Allure of the Earth
When you are through with trying
When you are tired and days are long
Letting go seems so inviting
The Allure of the Earth
The desire to give up
It is the encouragement
When you are discouraged
The Allure of the Earth
When the urges aren't worth fighting
The temptations on the great beyond
Become so exciting
It's no wonder I've felt so tired
I've witnessed the careless all running past me
While I've been told to ignore my desires
And grow numb with understanding
I walk through theses woods
I carry this deadwood
I am determined to see this through
Driven only by the guilt and the shame of giving up
I must complete what I set out to do - For you
It stayed on a shelf made of my arms
They had grown strong from giving support
I knew that my arms could hold out forever
It was my mind that'd grow tired
And in time would let go
It's been so long since I have questioned
What it is that I really want
Instead I follow your directions
As you lead me on
I can't use it to build my home
It will not fulfill my desires
Some wood can be used to help build a life
This wood will be used for building a fire
Why carry this deadwood with me...
when were I'm going there will be living trees
Now close enough to carry it all to the end
But throwing it all to the ground instead
This bundle of deadwood
The pieces they fall
Corners indent the soil and accumulate on one another
Tumble down and pile up
It awkwardly spills like myself at a time
Like the time it had killed
Like every moment after it was collected and held
I'd give up all that I started
To pursue all that I wanted
I may arrive empty handed
But at least I will arrive
Another era has come to an end
You'll return to where it began
Wandering at night on Ypres Rd.
To determine why you walk in the woods alone
A piece of out history I used to honour
They disrespected and disgraced
They took the ground upon which I walked
And rubbed it in my face
To me these woods are but a forest of metaphors
And nothing more
A path through the woods of my past
Where I was dragged across a forest floor
They breathe in the stagnant air
The poison sky shelters them from the sun
No exposure, nothing grows
No one ever wonders what lies beyond
So set in their old ways
They could only hope for change
Instead they flaunt their stubborn pride
Digging their own graves
To me these woods are but a forest of metaphors
And nothing more
A path through the woods of my past
Where I was dragged across a forest floor
I see the truth hidden between the trees
These tough woods are but delicate forest
Everyone for themselves in the hallowed name of unity
Finding comfort in their misery
They were doomed beyond the reach of help
Saved only by the unconditional love
Of hate for a place they couldn't live without
All that I hoped to change
Would not be reversed by words alone
It would require all of their efforts
The lack of which was already set in stone
At a time when I could take no more
I was dragged across a forest floor
Sticks and stones
The combined discomfort of hundreds of pains
Thorns and Needles
I pull them out of my skin
While walking home
Accept the fact that they've missed your point
Conceal your motives and all your thoughts
Keep your opinions to yourself
Give them exactly what they want
There's no hope for understanding
Our differences would not be solved
For my survival and my sanity
In time I learned to have tolerance for you all
Bite your tongue until it bleeds
Choke down the blood so no one sees
Fight the tears
Let them fall within
While you're here
Never let your weakness show
These woods are full of hope
These woods are where I walk alone
Even at times
When standing still
Strength and speed
Still lie dormant within
You will see me channel the pain
As blood leaves my core and fills my veins
These woods are but a forest of metaphors
And nothing more
The tall trees above
They are the ones that exist
The fallen leaves are those that have fallen to my feet
The trails of broken branches
These are the mistakes you make
The seeds are the ones to be that I push in the earth
With every step I take
How dare you subject me
To Summer's Envy
I will shine brighter than the day you left me
You will see traces of you in my revenge
Which is in everything I do
When summer comes
Your spotlight is the sun
You can do as you please
And get whatever you want
How dare you subject me
To Summer's Envy
I will shine brighter than the day you left me
You will see traces of you as I avenge
Everything you put me through
In the daytime
When everyone can see
It makes you look so good
Being cruel to me
How dare you subject me
To Summer's Envy
I will shine brighter than the day you left me
On that day you may have had my jealousy
But in time I will have yours and you will envy me
The summer sun may soothe your pain
As you escape to bathe in its rays
But you'll still come home to drown in me
Or at least where I used to be
The things I've said
The sound of my laugh
My hopes and dreams
Where I lay with you
Your memories of me
How dare you subject me
To Summer's Envy
I will shine brighter than the day you left me
One day I'll be able to make my peace with you
But not until years of revenge come true
There is a comfort in longing for
Something that's gone forever
It shows how much that something meant to you
When it was here
To a person who claims
To never having had anything
They can be confronted by
The empty space where something once was
I could only remember feeling so bad
When the present time was passing by
Looking back now I realise
That the best and worst times in my life
Could coincide
My greatest achievement is also my greatest loss
The best thing I ever had is forever gone
It is a dark and fulfilling feeling of frustration
To reminisce and feel the opposite of anticipation
It is a talent of the soul
To discover the joys in pain
Thinking of moments you long for
Knowing you'll never have them again
A moment of euphoria
Inspired by a photograph from that summer
I remember how we hated everything
And in that we managed to find comfort in each other
Those days are gone, my heart goes on
I long for the way it used to be
When summer comes it will return
That feeling will become again
It comes on strong and so fast
But you know that it won't last
It's just the hauntings of
The ghosts of summer's past
And though they are far behind me
I can still hear them calling
As if they were right beside me
Tempting my comfort in longing
On a county road
Under the purple sky
Fields of nothing
At our sides
The End of August
And into autumn
We stood at the edge
And watched the storm
The End of August
And into autumn
We prepare to get serious again
On a county road
Under the purple sky
Fields of nothing
At our sides
The End of August
And into autumn
We stood at the edge
And watched the storm
The End of August
And into autumn
A year from now I'll be so far away
On a county road
Under the purple sky
Fields of nothing
At our sides
The End of August
And into autumn
We stood at the edge
And watched the storm
Mine was that of a quiet love deep and true.
I'm at home in the North, 
when I'm alone in the Northern Cold
And I belong in the North, 
when I'm at home in the Northern Cold
If you seek understanding, 
I will try to explain to you
The origins of my madness, 
and my strength in solitude
Seldom seen, seldom spoken
My heart was my compass, and it was broken
Mine was that of a quiet love, deep and true.
I'm at home in the North,
when I'm alone in the Northern Cold
And I belong in the North,
when I'm at home in the Northern Cold
If you seek understanding,
I will show you what we have known
The long ride on the road to nowhere
The cold walks in the woods alone
In my ocean, the water was frozen
And I could see my reflection, within the ice
Mine was that of a quiet love, deep and true.
I'm at home in the North, when I'm alone in the Northern Cold
And I belong in the North, when I'm at home in the Northern Cold
Years later I am still obsessed with the North
Years later still restless and depressed from the Northern Cold
Years later I still drown in passion for my sorrows
Years later I'm alone, and I'm at home in the Northern Cold
My blues are so dark they are black. 
The roots are buried, so deep in the past.
See my roots, for they are true. 
Feel my blues, for they are real.
The feel of cold, the black of night, the white of snow,
Walking home, the smell of smoke, these are the memories of my youth.
We dug this hole for ourselves, but we'll gladly bury you instead
After having sacrificed yourselves, by standing in our way
I can hold the Iron Grudge, like a fist!
I can hold the Iron Grudge, for as long as I live
Can you feel the hatred, from your fellow man?
Can you see his ignorance? Unfortunately I can.
There's nothing more to say. There's nothing to discuss.
Enough words have already been heard. Enough deeds, been done.
You are not a mystery to us. We know exactly who you are.
And for as long as you might live, you are dead to us.
We dug this hole for ourselves, but we'll gladly bury you instead
After having sacrificed yourselves, by standing in our way
I can hold the Iron Grudge, like a fist!
I can hold the Iron Grudge, for as long as I live
Can you feel the envy, from you fellow man?
Can you see his ignorance? Unfortunately I can.
There's nothing more to say. There's nothing to discuss.
For I can see the fear in your eyes as you try to act tough
And as we rise up from the muck, we are filled with disgust even more
To realize that you ever thought, you were in the same league as us
We dug this hole for ourselves, but we'll gladly bury you instead
After having sacrificed yourselves, by standing in our way
I can hold the Iron Grudge, like a fist!
I can hold the Iron Grudge, and never lose my grip
I'm not your stepping-stone, I'm not your fucking crutch.
And for as long as you might live, I can hold the Iron Grudge!
I can hold the Iron Grudge!
Long live the Iron Grudge!
So go ahead and waste your time, it will keep you further behind!
Suffer!
Ever since I was born in a northern town
I've been digging myself out
From a time when I hadn't seen
Anything worth remembering
I would aspire to better life
To feast my eyes and expand my mind
I'd lie awake, I could not wait
To leave this place behind
Your Ontario town is just a burial ground
For old friends
Your Ontario town is just a burial ground
Inspired by hopelessness
From where my discontent once began
I miss the nature and the wilderness
But not the people there
As old stores will close their doors
Other ones may change their names
But old friends still live their lives
Where I would have died of shame
Your Ontario town is just a burial ground
For old friends
Your Ontario town is just a burial ground
You say that you grew up
You say that you tried
I think you took the easy way out
I say you gave up
I say you died
You'll say that you're content
You'll say there's no regrets
But I think you took the easy way out
For if you're not dreaming anymore
You're already dead
What a shame for those who chose
To be wasted in the north
What a shame to know nothing more
Than the town where you were born
Your Ontario town is just a burial ground
For old friends
Your Ontario town is just a burial ground
Kick over the stone that bares your name
I spit on the snow that covers your grave
Ripping down the valley of asphalt
Through a brainstorm of snow and ice
Where dynamite blasted the Canadian Shield, I ride
I understand the relation
Of black metal and modern life
How a cold winter scene
Can inspire distortion and screams
I am equal parts blood and ice
I am just as much man as tree
Through chaos and solitude I came
To become this black metal being
Each day I could see the changes
Each day I became more extreme
I understood how the sight of nature
Could inspire the sound of machines
I am equal parts blood and ice
I am just as much man as tree
Through chaos and solitude I came
To become this black metal being
I've traveled over dynamic earth at night
For the beauty of nature can lift my spirits
Even in the dead of winter.
Modern life can drive us to scream for the trees in harmony
For those of us who can't find peace, at least we can have a release.
I understand the translation
Universal in human behaviour
A common expression and interpretation
Of Black Metal and modern life
Focused and strong
Without distraction, I look within
No one to talk me out of what I believe
Without reaction, I proceed.
I was on my own and alone to decide
Black metal was all that mattered, at the time
I found faith inspired by nature
And I was defined.
I am equal parts blood and ice
I am just as much man as tree
Through chaos and solitude I came
To become this black metal being
On this northern highway, under the starry sky
Mine was a cold, nocturnal, winter ride
And in the distance...
A stranger flashed his lights...
We stood in the sand we stared at the stars
What good is any of it now?
These were the moments in our lives
That invoked years of silence
And after all that we had done
We had become the private joke
We knew the risks and we were willing to take them
And so we went through with it, and it would forever change us
We were those who felt they were desperate to live
We were those who'd let their hearts, beat themselves to death
We stood in the sand we stared at the stars
What good is any of it now?
These were the moments in our lives
That invoked years of silence
And after all that we had done
We had become the private joke
We couldn't go back to the way it was before
We would go our separate ways and never tell anyone
But what good are memories with no one to stand beside you?
What good are memories if those you made them with despise you?
We stood in the sand we stared at the stars
What good is any of it now?
These were the moments in our lives
That invoked years of silence
And after all that we had done
We had become the private joke
When I come home at the end of the day, 
everything is just where I left it.
No one has called, nothing has changed, 
everything is just how I left it.
I haven't spoken a word in days, 
except for cursing the noise in the hall...
I haven't spoken a word in days, 
to anyone else at all...
And so, as I go, I'll leave my body for you...
And so, as I go, don't feel sorry for me
For life is the sacrifice, before you die
And so as I go, I'll leave my body for you to see
A bed all alone in the bedroom
A vacant space where a table should be
Some posters on the walls
The bathroom mirror covered in spit
I have made such desperate attempts to make this a nice place to live...
And I have failed, 
for I have tried to fill this dead empty space with a life!
All this time on my hands,
And I have no where to go,
Haunted by the distractions of living alone
I hope you'd be the first one to find me
After I'd concluded the past behind me
So hold your hands, over your mouth
And run to tell the others...
Have you ever wondered what the world would be like without you?
If you murdered your dreams and we buried you
The thought that was the bitter seed, the subterranean trajectory
That was thrust deep within the earth, and grew into a twisted tree
The origins of modern sadness, to obsess over life and death
While life is short and growth is slow, patience is the task at hand
While the wait for happiness, can be agony
An eternity in death, can be much more easily achieved
It's the truth in true despair, deepest roots, darkest blues
The belief that all is lost, and that nothing can be done
How sad life can be when those, who once-wanted, don't want anymore
And when those who already have it, can't see it, for what it's worth
The frustration that as soon as you think that it is all just meaningless
You are proven wrong again, when you find meaning at the end...
Shallow within the earth, buried deep beneath the snow
You would remain forever young while the rest of us grow old
We would act upon our guilt, a northern burial was your wish
We would obey and fulfill, for your importance is strengthened by your early death
It's the truth in true despair, deepest roots, darkest blues
The belief that all is lost, and that nothing can be done
Forever frozen, never to decompose, your body would be preserved
While we all live, and struggle on, and inherit, the life that you deserved
Your youthful looks remembered, your dignity retained
While there would be no relief for us, and we'd look worse everyday
It's the truth in true despair, deepest roots, darkest blues
The belief that all is lost, and that nothing can be done
In our minds and in our hearts, in frames, you image will hang
On the walls of grieving homes and other places you would never go again
Imagine the things they would say about you, as if they really knew
How your death was premature, but your life was overdue.
You have already spent your better years taking your time for granted
It will be yours in the end, but at what price
To have wasted, your entire life
Wishing it all away... 
Death is a Tease!
To venture into the thought of despair and pull yourself back together again,
Knowing you had once stood on the edge and almost dove in.
Everything had driven me there, another lesson, best learned young:
When you want it, you can't have it, when you don't want it, it's done.
For all our guilt, for all our lies, for all we care, we'd gather together to say goodbye
As if the dead can't see the living, they would volunteer to twist the truth
For the comfort of each other and say "He was a good friend of mine."
Make the choice, to stay alive! Existence is your only hope to fight!
Not for the love of life or the fear of death, but to save the lies from the breath...
of the ones around you, who would speak and cry,
And the ones around you who would fake and lie,
Who would say that they knew you and that you would be missed,
As a storm of admiration buries you again.
The fire still burns, when you are gone. 
Life in the North goes on without you.
My fire will burn, with you or not. 
My passion will overcome.
Year's end, coming home, 
and what do you have to show for yourself?
I amount to nothing more, 
than what they understand.
Feel the sense of confusion, 
for your wins you cannot explain.
See the lack of comprehension, 
over the ground you worked so hard to gain.
The fire still burns, when you are gone.
My fire will burn, with you or not.
We live for the thrill of the struggle.
We live for the love of our sorrows.
I fight the fight I can never win, 
but I fight the fight for the fight itself.
And so I am rich with failure? 
Brutal north, bring me down again.
I guess these are the risks you take, 
when you've been gone for so many years.
Would they even look up from their tables, if suddenly you appeared?
The fire still burns, when you are gone.
My fire will burn, with you or not.
We live for the thrill of the struggle.
We live for the love of our sorrows.
Brutal north bring me down.
Brutal north bring me down again.
I stood at the foot of the mill again, like a metaphor of northern time.
I watched them burn off the excess, flames to the sky
The fire still burns, when your are gone
My fire will burn, with you or not
So many small losses, for one giant gain
Quiet victories spent alone, along the way
Now I wander the streets as out of place as the day I left
No better off. Nothing has changed. These are the risks we take
Brutal north bring me down.
Brutal north bring me down again.
Trying hard to enjoy the night, to make the best of my time
And I would kill to know what it's like to feel tonight
With each cold sip of life, which helps to numb the pain
Each touch of the glass to my lips, helps ease the strain.
It's been so long, it's been so much
Though I would shudder at your sight
I would still shatter at your touch
For I feel like ice this evening, walking down the stairs
Hidding my face into the basement, as if anyone cares.
That oh I'm out tonight. I'm out to try to live tonight.
For tomorrow it may seem as though I never did.
It's been so long, it's been so much
Though I would shudder at your sight
I would still shatter at your touch
The season was cold, and I was alone, developing tastes for poisons.
This was my old haunt, and it haunted me still.
I am not, that good anymore, and maybe I never was,
But I'll play my heart out for you, one more time.
For in my old age, all I can do is play for you a song from my youth.
So let me share my gift, with you once more,
Just like we had in the past, so many times before.
My hands may shake, my muscles are weak,
I'm not strong as I used to be.
But still I will play for you, and leave you with a song,
For when you have music you're never alone.
Let me share my gift, with you once more
Just like we had in the past, so many times before
The song of redemption is all that I am,
For in the end, the music is all that I have.
And though it feels incomplete, the deadline has come for me.
I must present to you, My 'masterpiece'...
For time is short in my condition, the song of redemption
Will be the final composition, from this tired musician.
Please give me your attention and I will remedy, this silent tension
And I hope that you will remember,
I hope the memories will leave a lasting impression
Of me, when I'm gone. Gone. After I am gone.
I don't need to concentrate, I can close my eyes.
And though you'll hear this song but once,
I've rehearsed it, a thousand times.
But what will you say, after I'm done?
After I've attempted to play the song of redemption.
And what will you say, after I'm gone?
After I've attempted to play the song of redemption.
It's never too late to admit that you were wrong, 
when the journey has made you wise enough to know the time has come, 
to end the tradition.
We came this far, 
to admit that we were wrong and the time we wasted, 
has made us who we are.
Though the recovery has just begun, it will one day be complete,
For we are forever in transition, blazing paths of radical change.
With our interest in good intentions, satisfied.
We leave with peace even though we failed, knowing at least we tried.
Lessons learned, perspective earned, clear sight on the highway drive at night.
A bigger picture is on the horizon, and the view is easy on the eyes.
It was what it was but it will be no more.
From now on we are only going forward without you.
For no more will we invest our time.
Repairing unions or rekindling old fires.
The highway was once the only thing between us, 
but it is all that connects us now.
Sever all ties! Cut your losses and run!
One thing we have learned, from the cycle of repetition,
Patterns of negative thought always bring you back to the same old places.
No more will we waste our time, with those who have lost touch
No more will we reach out to them, or let them come to us
Let the void of your presence, be the voice that speaks in your turn
Let the ashes of the past be sifted by those who let it burn.
No more will we gather, on occasion in the same place
No more will we continue to recognize a common faith
No more will we travel, long distances to maintain our bond
No more will we unite as one, this is the end of tradition.
At the opposite ends of a void, the highways divide us forevermore!
For those who think they are brave
Because they've never been afraid.
Who judge those enduring consequences,
When they have always been saved.
To all those ignorant fucks who've always suckled from the teat:
I hope, one day, you'll meet your fate
Locking eyes with the wild beast.
For those who think they have all the answers,
Though they've never been tested.
Who are defiant to the rules of the world,
Though they've never had to face it, themselves.
To all those ignorant fucks who've always suckled from the teat:
I hope, one day, you'll meet your fate
Locking eyes with the wild beast.
Not to be taken by your fellow man, not to be taken by your own hand,
Not having succumbed to disease, but having faced the wild beast.
For after only one glance of the beast, in the blink of an eye,
The young dawn, that was your life, has suddenly turned into midnight.
As if it fell from the sky, your jaw drops in awe.
Piss your self in fear. No clever language will save you here
As you slowly quicken the pace, as you try to slip away,
Just as you think you will be okay...
You realize you've become the chase...
Let her take you down. Let her take you in her mouth.
The moonlight reflecting in her eyes,
The moonlight is shinning off her cold, sharp claws.
Let her tear you limb from limb, let nature take its course.
Let her kill and devour, kill and devour and kill some more.
Memories are flashing before your eyes of old friends & dead relatives.
With hallucinations induced from being eaten alive.
Where no one could hear you scream, where no one could see you cry,
An unlikely fate in present day, man and beast, face to face.
You went looking for thrills and adventure, they came looking for you as well.
You wanted nature? Nature wanted you as well.
At the scene of the mauling, black cloth and blood in the snow.
Surrounded by a crowd of trees you will be, but cold bones in the spring.
Rejection from ourselves, will only lead to reflection in the peace and quiet
The sooner we quit trying to find the sound, the sooner we'll find ourselves instead.
Suffering the pains taken, dwelling in the pain of creation.
For the artist's mistakes, stare him in the face for years after, they are made.
To love music more than life itself, is such a waste, of life, and love, and hell.
Modern desires to create euphoric misery we make for ourselves.
For modern music is self-indulgent, we have always done it for ourselves.
For it is not a matter of life and death, but life only and itself.
To live is to light a torch and carry it as far as you can go,
Before the winds blow so hard, the flame goes out
As you fall crashing down, to the snow.
Knowing at least that when you fail,
Someone could relight that torch
And carry it the rest of the way, someday,
In honor of you and who you were to them
It's never too late to admit you were wrong. It's never to late to admit what you need.
Beautiful to have come, beautiful to see, but also beautiful to leave.
There is nothing more you can take from us now. 
This is the end my friend
The dream is dead!
I am in denial, and I am depressed
I will try to bargain with you, then share my anger with you
But I can't complete the full cycle of mourning
I struggle with acceptance
I can't forgive myself
Everything I touch turns to gold, then to coal
Everything I touch turns to rust, then to dust
My clothes are full of holes, hanging off my tired body
I command so much negativity, my charge drains the life from machinery
But I feel such powerlessness, when I struggle with forgiveness
Yet I don't know my own strength, when I destroy everything
I am in denial, and I am depressed
By the time you read this, I will already be dead
Do not reply to this, it is only to be read
By the time you read this, I will already have been killed
Do not reply to this, but notify my next of kin
Self administrate your estate,
Pick up the pieces and give them away
Let them take all the things they want and dispose of yourself
Photos and notes go into the sink
Under all the hot water the faucet could give
Now my dreams are just running ink
Going down the dream
By the time you read this, I will already be gone
Do not reply to this, but realize what you have done
By the time you read this, it will already be true
Do not reply to this, just understand what you made me do
By the time you read this, I will have gone the way good men go
When they go bad, where they go bad
By the time you read this, I will have gone to the place where good men go
Where they go wrong, when they go wrong
By the time you read this, I will already have been changed
Do not reply to this, after I've experienced maximum pain
No longer good to anyone, and never would be again
Know that I spent my final days, endlessly tying the endless loose ends
One last look around the place, with sun shining into empty room
For the final time I close the door that will open for someone new
The only change I make before I leave, is in the bedroom of my dreams
Where I covered the walls in deep blue paint, rather than my blood and my brains
By the time you read this, I will already be dead
Do not reply to this, it is only to be read
By the time you read this, I will already be dead
I was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, alone and unceremoniously
Buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, when life was taken from me
Our tree was full and green, I had to leave it
The sadness was overwhelming,
To be alone beneath it
The sun came down hot and hard, I could never sleep
To disappear was the only way I could find relief
When I was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, alone and unceremoniously
Buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, when life was taken so suddenly
Next to Eaton's tomb, I hung my head and cried
I gave up and died
When I was buried.
The birds sang, the flowers in bloom, spring had just begun
Recently fitted for a suit, now lying in a box
By summer, I was gone, my remains stolen from the ground
My body never recovered and I was never found
Until now
I was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, alone and unceremoniously
Buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, between the monuments and trees
At the heart of the city, Amongst the statues and fountains
New life could begin, where the old path I ran came to and end
I was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, alone and unceremoniously
Buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, when life was taken from me
Everyone lives, but not everyone truly dies
While they're still alive and survive
Without anything to lose, I don't care what will happen to me
I climb through this dirty window of opportunity
I feel a change of heart
From the pain of a heartbreaking loss
I hear awful sounds crying out
I feel my heart breaking loose
I cast away at my own will, to mourn alone across the sea
It may never feel good, it may never feel right
But it seemed like a good idea at the time
I don't want praise for going away, it draws attention to my loss
But drink alone for me while I am gone, 
We'll together again when I come home
I feel my heart breaking away,
From the pain of a heartbreaking loss
I hear the awful howl come ripping from my mouth
I feel my heart breaking loose
Disconnect and disassociate yourself from everything and everyone you know.
Just let go. 
Go. 
Don't look back, and see where it takes you. 
After a year has passed you might feel good enough to come home, 
or there's the excitement that you may leave and just stay, 
and never come home again, either way, you'll be glad you did it. 
Having left and gone from being able to decide for yourself 
after you've done your time.
They say that time heals all wounds, 
well this is a good way to spend that time, 
what better way to distract yourself from sadness 
than to fully obligate your crisis to the point where it becomes about survival, 
making it a total mindfuck about the fact that it's allowing you to erase your memory
deprogram yourself and rebuild somewhere in the abyss.
Surrendering all control and familiarity, 
boldly going into the unknown, 
focusing on your voluntary deportation from your own home, 
you know you have to go, flights are running on time, 
ask yourself the question 
Can you get here in ten days?
It's time to cross the ocean... and dive, into exile!
On the other side of night and day
I could be no farther away
The moon I see is not our moon,
This sun is not the one we know
But the are safe with you at home
It's I, who's gone
And I am pining for you,
Reminded of you all the time
I'm always pining, for you
What I thought was so unique about you
Must be common after all
For I am constantly reminded of you everywhere I go
What I thought was so extraordinary, is common after all
As I am constantly pining for you, everywhere I go
You could go anywhere and people would invite you to stay
I could meet anyone else and still feel completely alone
So I try to distract myself and make new discoveries
But as I explore the forests of my Seoul, I see you in the trees
And I am pining for you,
Reminded of you all the time
I'm always pining, for you
What I thought was so unique about you
Must be common after all
For I am constantly reminded of you everywhere I go
What I thought was so extraordinary is common around the world
Men are always pining for their loves, while their loves don't pine for them at all
And I am pining for you, reminded of you in everything I see
I'm always pining, for you
And I am pining for you, reminded of you in everything I see
I'm always pining for you, though I know you don't pine for me
In the land of the rising sun, I dream of the midnight run
In the land of the morning calm, I lie awake until tomorrow's dawn
On the other side of night and day
I could be no farther away
The moon I see is not our moon, This sun is not the one we know
Life is just pain and piss; it's nothing that I will miss
Life is just pain and piss; it's just temporary
Life is the madness of a drunken city night
With wet leather on your back and rain dripping off your spikes
PAIN! Life is just pain and piss. 
PISS! It's nothing that I will miss.
PAIN! Life is just pain and piss and everything is a scam
Life is your hopes and dreams, your expectations
When your health is a full-time job, and there's no vacation
Life is the comfort of a good friend's advice
Who says it's all your fault and your standards are too high
PAIN! Life is just pain and piss. 
PISS! It's nothing that I will miss.
I'm always doing something to hurt myself just trying to feel alive
Life is the impact of a falling brick wall of rain
Coming down on your long walk home when your thoughts are sobering
Life is your consciousness as you tame your wild beasts
When exhaustion is the currency that you must pay for sleep
Life is just pain and piss; 
it's nothing that I will miss
Life is just pain and piss; 
it's just temporary
Life is the madness of a drunken city night
Drag that fucking weight man,
Drag that weight and breathe
Pull that fucking anchor across the rocks, push that mountain into the sea
Drag that Weight! Over Foreign Landscapes! 
Drag that Weight!
Like a 10 ton stone statue, standing before miles of mountains
In a foreign land, where you don't speak the language there
I feel so heavy man... So I drag that weight!
And I drag that weight over foreign landscapes
Slow and heavy!
Drag that weight and breathe
Pull that fuckin' anchor across the rocks, 
push that mountain into the sea
A little more today, a little less the next
Halves and quarters are keeping me going
A little less today, a little more the next
Halves and quarters are keeping me going
I'm weaning myself off the one thing that's keeping me alive
I'm weaning myself off the one thing that's helping me to survive
I'm splittin' the pills that aide me with my ills
I'm weaning myself off the one thing one day at a time
A little more today, a little less the next
Halves and quarters are keeping me going
A little less today, a little more the next
I see you in my sleep
In this sequence of dreams, you are here with me
I see you in my dreams
In this sequence of dreams, you are here with me
In this sequence of dreams, you are with me here
It's unlikely to meet and share a dream, If I'm sleeping while you're awake
But when I think of you for strength, in dreams you reappear
And you are here with me, in this sequence of dreams you are with me here
I see you in my sleep
In this sequence of dreams, you are here with me
I see you in my dreams
It's good that I sleep alone so often
Because I toss and turn so much, I feel bad when I disturb my partner
It's okay that I toss and turn all night, every night
Because I sleep alone so often, I feel bad when I've disturbed my partner
It's good that I'm alone, because I sleep so much so often
And I sleep so much because I am alone, so often, all the time
It's good that I sleep alone so often
Because I toss and turn so much, I feel bad when I disturb my partner
It's okay that I toss and turn all night, every night
You must grieve your loss, until the grief is gone
But once you've come this far, you can't look back anymore
But whatever you do, don't open the wounds
Whatever you do, don't open the wounds
You must undo the dream, as part of your deprogramming
It's what you force yourself to do when change has been forced upon you
It doesn't help to hurt yourself, late at night and most alone
And don't deprive yourself of light as you try to pass the day time
Yesterdays forecast was totally wrong
And I accept the happiness that didn't come
Hold your head up high and revel in the moment you feared would never come
To be standing skywide armspread on a mountain again
Hold your head up high, again, 
and revel in the feeling you feared would never return, to be
I'm on a mountain again!
You must grieve your loss, until the grief is gone
But once you've come this far, you can't look back anymore
But whatever you do, don't open the wounds
The vicious beating, the rapid flow of thinning blood
Pumping fluid that warms the darkness of my heart
The heavy breathing, the strangest desire
The drive of evolution is designed not to be denied
No day is complete without the enjoyment of flesh
For the daily ritual is essential to the rhythm of strength and vitality
Do not deny yourself the pleasures of life
Resistance of nature is a painful way to go
Even the savage beast needs love to thrive
Follow your instincts and let them run wild
We are beasts designed to feel
Rewarded with pleasure, and punished with oh so much pain
Universal, survival of the species is driven by natural technologies
The vicious beating, the rapid flow of thinning blood
Pumping fluid that warms the darkness of my heart
The heavy breathing, the strangest desire
I was right all along, and I was wrong to believe,
Foolish to doubt the self-respecting truths, I learned while suffering.
Nothing happens for any reason, there is no plan.
We are all just random beings, not destined for anything.
The world is nothing, disguised as something it is not.
Aspire to be something, appearing as you really are.
Dig deep to find your strength, trust that wisdom comes with age.
But when ways of old have been outgrown, don't hesitate to chop them down
Once you've been leveled out, reconnect with yourself again.
When new ideas have led you astray, return yourself to whom you once became.
The world is nothing, disguised as something it is not.
Aspire to be something, appearing as you really are.
Cut yourself down to the stem. Stand upon level ground again.
Tear yourself all the way down and rebuild yourself in solitude.
When left alone, the forests renew themselves.
When left alone, man improves himself, as well.
You always knew, one day you would destroy me.
And I always knew I would have to be the one to restore me.
Your need for self-reflection is a reflection of you and a sign of the times.
Your use of self-expression is a weapon in the age in which we live.
When you hold the hammer, you are the weapon,
Smash the mirror for seven years of self-sacrifice.
When you hold the mirror, you're in reflection,
Reflect the truth and not the curse of superstition.
I thought you were taking pictures of me,
But that was just the lights burning out!
It was no one's dream to follow me,
When everyone wants to be followed themselves.
Your self-expression is a reflection of the mind.
Use it to make peace with yourself,
Those around you and the age in which you live.
Make peace with the age in which you live.
Your need for self-reflection is a reflection of you and a sign of the times.
Your use of self-expression is a weapon in the age in which we live.
When you hold the hammer, you are the weapon,
Smash the mirror for seven years of self-sacrifice.
When you hold the mirror, you're in reflection,
Reflect the truth and not the curse of superstition.
I thought you were taking pictures of me,
But that was just the lights burning out!
It was no one's dream to follow me,
When everyone wants to be followed themselves.
Your self-expression is a weapon of the mind.
Use it to defend yourself, threaten others and enhance your life.
Threaten others and enhance your life.
Your need for self-reflection is a reflection of you and a sign of the times.
Your use of self-expression is a weapon in the age in which we live.
When you hold the hammer, you are the weapon,
Smash the mirror for seven years of self-sacrifice.
When you hold the mirror, you're in reflection,
Reflect the truth and not the curse of superstition.
I thought you were taking pictures of me,
But that was just the lights burning out!
It was no one's dream to follow me,
When everyone wants to be followed themselves.
Another year, another room, where you hang a few things on the walls.
It's just where you call home for now,
Until it's time to take them down and move on.
Great company, has no where else they need to be,
No place else they'd rather go, and no one waiting for them at home.
Another year, another room, you still don't care to own anything.
You know you won't find what you want, in a place where you don't belong.
I am wanted, wherever there is a need,
For those with no place to go, who need somewhere new to be.
Hope is the room, you make in your heart,
To find a new home for all your misguided love.
Look at the room I've made. I am nearly empty again,
But I want to give to you, and I like it when you take from me.
I still don't care to own anything. I still don't have anything to defend.
But less is more than ever before, in transition again...
Another year, another room, where you hang a few things on the walls.
It's just where you call home for now,
Until it's time to take them down and move on.
We are almost whole
We have burned it down again and again…
Returning to foundation year after year…
Suffering from neglect and deterioration…
We are almost whole
We have burned it down again and again
Returning to foundation year after year
Suffering from neglect and deterioration
Bodies waiting for demolition
Once and for all
We’re taking closure with satisfaction
There could be no turning back
Deny yourself your mixed emotions
You have a job to do, so wipe away your tears
And drive it forward now
I see you falling apart, but I know you’re not worth tearing down
The floor is running out beneath us
The caving roof was pouring in
Broken glass lie all around us
The doors will slam right off their hinges…
The floor is running out beneath us
The caving roof was pouring in
Broken glass lie all around us
The doors will slam right off their hinges
We’re past the point of no return here
Nothing can be salvaged now
So look past your hesitations
You have a job to do, so gather up your strength
And drive it forward now
I see you falling apart, but I know you’re not worth tearing down
I'm afraid to start this
I want to tear you down
But if you leave without this
I'm going to tear it all right down
Right now
We are almost whole
The floor is running out beneath us
We have burned it down again and again
The caving roof was pouring in
Returning to foundation year after year
Broken glass lie all around us
Suffering from neglect and deterioration
The doors will slam right off their hinges
Your pretty causes
Make great conversation
While another world is yearning
Painfully for an end
And who will save me now
Now that you are gone
And who will save you from yourself
You were the light
That shone brightly in the night
You were the light
That shone harshly on my life
Think of me when you are weak
Whenever when you are strong
Pretending that I'm OK
Will comfort when you are lost
And who will save me now
Now that you are gone
And who will save you from yourself
You were the light
That shone brightly in the night
You were the light
That shone harshly on my life
Close the door and cry,
Or lock it up from the outside.
Look down on me from the balcony,
And hold the railing tight.
And if you changed your mind
Then you are justified
And if you changed your mind
You'd know that you were right
And you will be just fine
The more you knew
The less you wanted to
You made our decisions on your own
And left me without a choice to choose
None of this
Will ever haunt you now
Since there is no one else
Accounting for your cruelty but me
You will see no consequence
And though I am not to blame
I suffer all the same
And who will save me now
Now that you are gone
And who will save you from yourself
You were the light
That shone brightly in the night
You were the light
That shone harshly on my life
You were the light
That flash and left me in the dark
You were the light
The only light I'll ever know
You were the light
There was a flash of lightning, 
Followed by snow
In a moment of silence for myself, 
After a shock to the soul
With a look of disbelief, 
Alone and numb to the cold
I knew the last moment had passed, 
Before enduring years of sorrow
There was a crack of electric light, coming down from a darkened sky
My dreams flashed before my eyes, as they were erased from my life.  
There was a flash of lightning, 
Followed by snow
Twas just the moment of change, 
Before years of sorrow
The shock and awe, the fright and woe
I only had one life to live, and life said no.
The loss of love, has left me hollow
All bliss twists into pain, 
Where there was joy, years of grief have followed!
There was a flash of lightning, 
followed by snow
It struck my heart, only once which made me want it more
The emptiness it left in me, will always need to be filled
For it will be there all the time, from now on, forever more.  
There was a crack of electric light, coming down from a darkened sky
My dreams flashed before my eyes, AS they were erased from my life.  
There was a flash of lightning, 
Followed by snow
Twas just a moment of pain, 
Before years of sorrow
The shock and awe, the fright and woe
And when I asked for a second chance, life said no.
The bleak life and modern times
Of grey skies and electric light
Life... life... So life is precious, after all
Respect the body, for it is all you really are
Life... life... So life is precious after all
Protect the body, for it is all that keeps you on
We are confined to the nature of reality
Where the failure of our system will be the end of our dream
Between the fields of darkness, before and after we exist
Earth is a spiritual place but there is nothing after this.
We were nothing for a billion years before our time
And we will be nothing more again for an eternity yet to come
Death is not an exit
death is the flick of the switch
Death is not an exit
death is the flick of the off switch
The bleak life and modern times
Of grey skies and electric light
In the bleak life and modern times
Of grey skies and electric light
It is a fair and noble arrangement
This business of life and existence
Where everything we take from the earth
Will be taken back and returned
The face of god has always been disguised
As the mother giver of all life
But the keeper of the ledger for the cult of nature
Only concerns that your body returns on time
Return to the earth, Pay the price for your existence
Into the hand of earths domain,
For there is balance to be maintained
The count is cold and calculated, The precision is exact
No one is exempt or unaccounted for,
All that was taken will be taken back.
The gods have always been believed to love,
And care for the quality of our lives
But the keeper of the ledger for the cult of nature
Only concerns with the quantity of your time
We create our myths and purpose,
To fill our lives with hope and wonder
But to the keeper of the ledger for the cult of nature
Your body is just another number.
It is a fair assumption, of our human nature to assume...
That the business of nature is inherently good
When Nature comes collecting, It doesn't care at all about you
Nature comes collecting, It doesn't care at all to know you
When Nature comes collecting, It doesn't care to hear your story
Nature comes collecting, and only wants you for your body
Nature is the man after all, Nature is the mob after all
Nature is the business after all, Nature is the cult
When I look around you I understand why you believe
I see your evidence of God, all around me
You have so therefore you are  But I have not.  
You've seen the evidence of God in your life, but I have none.
When I was questioned, I shook my head and starred
I was traveling alone, and had nothing to declare
He asked how I knew for sure
And would I tell everyone I knew
If it would hurt to know the truth
I can be thankful to be alive but I despise this life. 
in all my years, at best, have only learned just to survive.
But When I look around you I understand why you believe
I see your evidence of God, all around me
You have so therefore you are
But I have not.  
You've seen the evidence of God but I have not and I have none
When he asked me, I shook my head and laughed
I never had a taste for life 
and I felt there was no turning back
Would I try to take away their hope?
Replace it with reality
and offer them reality
Exchange their joy with my bleak view
And leave them miserable like me?
I have searched and I have tried to find a place where I can be
I love my homeland dearly but never carved a place in society
But When I look around you I understand why you believe
I see your evidence of God, all around me
You have so therefore you are, but I have not
You are too rich for hate, and I am too poor to love.
When I asked him, he shook his head and stared
I see no evidence of God, in the men from the west
A moment of silence... but not one moment more
The dead are to be forgotten, we are here to be adored 
Look me, in the eyes, don't believe a word they say
For life is good, life is glory, though we live, one life only
Tell me, in real time, don't hesitate to profess
Love me, in the flesh, don't wait 'till death to sing my praise
A moment of silence... but not one moment more
The dead are to be forgotten, we are here to be adored 
IN the bleak life and modern times, Under grey skies and electric light
Mortal men are living gods, More real than any God ever was
Our people are civilized... 
Love the living while they're still alive 
Our people are civilized...
we shouldn't worship the dead.
In The bleak life and modern times, 
Under grey skies and electric light
Where the living still walk the earth alone, 
more real than any God ever was
In bleak life, We are realer than gods!
More real than any God ever was
In modern times we are realer than Gods!
More real than any God ever was
Under grey skies and electric light, 
we the living still walk the earth alone
Where mortal men are living gods, more real than any God ever was.  
A moment of silence, for the dead but not one moment more
They've all gone to be forgotten, were still here, to be adored
Look me, in the face, and don't believe a word I say
This life is hard, this life is lonely, and we are here, for one night only
See the pain, in my eyes, the defeat, of my age
Feel the urgency of time, and don't wait 'till death to sing my praise
A moment of silence for the dead, but not one moment more
The dead are to be forgotten, we are here to be adored
If you're waiting for tomorrow, save yourself for another day
But if you're living in the moment, don't wait 'till death to sing my praise
In The bleak life and modern times, Under grey skies and electric light
Mortal men are living Gods, More real than any God ever was
Come when you need me, leave me when you need to be free
Come when you want me, leave me when you need me to understand
Did you fall out of love, because you fell in love again?
Did you fall out of love, because you fell in love, with someone new? 
When the new love, shined with all the promise of all I couldn't give to you.
And the new life offered all you wanted, and you had to choose
I helped to carry you, I took good care of you, I wanted us to continue
But I knew, that you would leave, when the time was right for you.
Life was a relay I passed it off to you.  You ran away, and won the race
You never looked back, to see what happened to me, For I was only second place
When the new love, shined with all the promise of all I couldn't give to you.
And the new life offered all you wanted, and you were asked to choose.
We come together to share your sorrows 
where you save yourself for someone else. 
You keep your distance in times of hope, 
while I cry for you all by myself
When you're silver, you never come first, 
When you're silver, the truth always hurts.
I don't want unconditional love, 
I'll always need to be judged
I don't want a traditional love, 
I'll always need to be wanted
loved by someone else
When did the city make you so cold?
We share your sorrows but I dine alone...
When did the city make you so cold?  
I cry alone while you dine with someone else
When did the city make you so cold?
We cry together but I dine alone...
When did the city make you so cold?
We share your sorrows but I dine alone... 
I always dine alone...
We were born to live, in a desperate time
Where it seems the death of dreams, is the end of life
But we have only one life to live, just one opportunity
And failure is not the end of the world, that's just society!
We are all expendable, and we can be replaced.
They have supplies of infinite lives, and no time to waste.  
But we have only one life to live, one time to exist
And though there is no afterlife after all, 
there is still more to life than this!
Death is the failure of our parts,
Failure is just the death of dreams
There's more to life than suc-cess
but only death is real... 
ONLY DEATH IS REAL!
Death is the failure of our parts,
Failure is just the death of dreams
There's more to life than success
but only death is real... 
When we're young, we design a plan, we work, we build, we make it real
and in the moment it becomes complete, The first cracks start to appear
A weak foundation, finally revealed
in the desperation, when the walls came tumbling down
Oh, In my prime
Oh, never to return
Oh, as I once was
A broken man, Living half a life... 
without you...
On the path to recovery, 
As a sign of the times, with the empires crumbling
I left all dreams abandoned, 
On the steps of a modern life
In defeat we redesign the plan, and we give it just one more chance
As we take another deep breath, and prepare for the worst, again 
A life in crisis, is always threatened by time
For the longer it takes to be restored... 
the less likely it is to occur.
Oh, In my prime
Oh, never to return
Oh, as I once was
A broken man, Living all alone...
without you...
On the path to recovery, with the empires crumbling
I left all dreams abandoned, On the steps of a modern life
On the path to recovery, with the empires crumbling
I left all dreams abandoned with you, On the steps of a modern life
There is always hope, of course, that one day, we will rise again
but this modern life architecture, Is crumbling, under the weight of the world 
To mourn the end is to say goodbye
Not To yearn for that which we will never have again
We cry for our life together 
because we know it will end
And we try to understand, how we could ever love again
Save your tears, at the end of our time...
We've cried enough in our lives, at the end of our time, 
just kiss my ashes goodbye
We miss them so much now that they are gone
Took them for granted for living, so long
We read their words again, and we listen to them again 
as we start to understand, what they were trying to say, all along
save your tears,
At the end of our time, kiss my ashes goodbye. 
Kiss my ashes goodbye.
Curse all those who were so vain 
who felt entitled to hold a place on the earth as a grave for their remains
but no monument for me, please... I am not one of them
I didn't need it in life, I wont need it in death
Whoa, just kiss my ashes goodbye
Whoa, when I die...kiss my ashes goodbye
When words become irrelevant, 
and you start to feel as though ...you've been misled
Keep me out of sight, leave me out of mind...
when the thought no longer serves you
when I no longer serve you, just let the memories die
Whoa, kiss my ashes goodbye
Whoa, when I die...
kiss my ashes goodbye
When we have all gone, to the silence of eternity... 
To first be forgotten, and lost in, the records of the earth
Could I still miss you, then, in the time and space after life
When no one is searching anymore, and where we are nowhere to be found
We didn't spend our life together
and I will miss you forever
The choice was mine, 
To long for a time, that will never come
Though we leave the world apart, 
I, still went peacefully, quietly, 
with you, still, firmly... in my heart.
I will wait forever.  I wait...
In the darkness, under the stars, 
With enough warning, to pull off to the side, in time
In the end, was there anyone to share in your joy?
I woke up one day...and realized it was already over
Back On the highway, under the moon, my final moments, 
still wondering about you...
In the end, was there anyone to share in your joy?
I woke up for years without you, to realize it was already over, for me 
Now making amendments... 
to the dream
Changing the ending, as I would like it, to be
We were together, in a memory
And We live forever, in finality.
Holding on... To a dream... 
When the end... couldn't come slow enough for me. 
Holding on...
Despair, torn by hate,
DISTORTED ATMOSPHERE
Alas, observing the inconvenient horizon
Prepare to launch all terrestrial
imprudence, until nothing remains;
COMPLETE THE IMMOLATION
Abstract emotion, major impropriety
philanthropic tendencies concretely oppressed!
IMPORTUNATED PROPHECIES
EXTERMINATING AMNESTIES
DECAYING IMMORTALLY
FREEDOM IN OUR DEATH!
For England and the monarchy
we free our souls; our destiny
Though it is implied tratory
TO THE ENTIRE EARTH HUMANITY
One by one, they fell into the sea
The gleam extinguished; arduous future wait for me
Gravity; the deep pulls me under
Darkness fills me, and I gurgle as is sink
THE CLOUDS ABOVE ARE DARK, I CAN FEEL IT!
AS ARCHIPELAGO WANTS TO SWALLOW ME
MY BLOODSHOT EYEBALLS; 
MY PRESSURED LUNGS
MY LIFE; MY LIFE IS IT SLOWLY FADING!?
CONATION COMES IN WAVES; THEY TAKE YOU TO THE SHORE
Into the abyss I fall
And Dark is the Reich of the dead
A portal to reach to the side
Where bodies fall from the sky
Solitude And Peace Of Mind
Entombed In Cromlech
Yes, flee over the River Styx
and join the dead with joy
An ocean of Blasphemy
Heathenish realm
My Prophecy is true...
We'll All Make It Through
The dark and cold wastelands of
Grey dust softens when my down turned
triangular teardrops covers the ground
This secret got lost to the shepherd's flock
My burning skin connects with the sands of time
and thus the holy angels appear...
Drag THEM through the mud
Instead of me
This is not the death I choose
your Christian trials are wrong!
I speak of what I want
And my heart lies therein
Blackened you say
Then black is my way
And call me an Enemy
I shall only stand proud
Awaiting the rise of the DarkSide
I have had this Vision
of a voyage in mind and soul
Through silent Somniferous scenes
within the enclosed chambers of my
untouched spiritual experiences
Soaring through damp air, Seeing
faces, twisting, plunging through my colour
Cosmic Fear arrives, I hold a dead one,
Surrounded by my many candles
I burn to cleanse the air
Rotten Unclean Sacrifice Nightmares
Unreal Psychedelic Journey
Ride The Darkside
Search The Soulside
Enter to realm of Satan
Landscapes of frozen methane
Vast fields of blue dust before my eyes
I was sent here to describe and tease
the minds of the fantasy kings of my homeland
On a ship of curiosity I sail
what treasure can be found here
And why must eyes face this
Unearthly show of morbid climate
Behind the Neptune hillsides
They say the towers stand tall
Built by hands dissimiliar to mine
And Brought alive
by hearts of ancient alien cultures
Oh, once again, I kneel before this altar
Out in the moist chilly forest I proclaim
The Autumn leaves that fell
And those who still attach the trees
The Breeze that blew my hair
The one I've known through all these years...
The songs I never forgot
A past that is now Lost...
I am allergic to my own tongue
Licking my wounds, end up in Tears
I sweep my teeth in yellow Spit
Rotting Christ before my eyes
I spit in the mouth of the priest
Revenge for Those Who Died
So what if I am fucking insane
I'll fucking kill you anyway!
My very heart blows out of my fucking chest
And the beams go wild against the brown, brown wall
I hope they give me
A Grave With A View...
Burn the crucifix.
Cremate the soul of the Virginborn
Freeze the shadow of ashes and let
it float away by the Thunder listener's
intense eyelash movements under their
concentration to open the cosmic lid
Crush not only our surrounding walls
of curiosity, but also the hordes
of Blind Believers. 
The Open Road,
like a blue horizon
And you could see for Miles
So we could submerge right here
And we should bring our hearts there...
Top of the White trees
would mean nothing to us
Nor the silent whispers
from the souls of glass
Nocturnal flight, no shadows cast
a distant symbol of our beyond
life lies in front of us
Sacred Ground, Rotten Earth
Ashes To Dust
Flesh Decomposed
Caressing the sacred ground
where the deadened corpses lie
A sepulchural misty night
with a whiff of the Macabre
Silently watching the stones
put there as a symbol of death
Our minds united; A force is lit,
and insight creates
A humanoid watchtower, reaching for
their souls to the Sky
For a glance onto
The Other Side...
Desert... Night...
Coyotes Feel the Cold Wave of The Dark
Red Eyes eats through
the Vast Nocturnal Landscape
A Strong Light
The Only Night
This is where he made Sculptures
from the Visions that Created The Force
Baphomet in Steel
For the Flesh of Cain
A Throne made by remains
of 12 holy Disciples
New Disciples rose,
one by one, ten by ten
All met under the Desert Moonlight
Knowledge fired across the Landscape
Sparks that mixed with Coyote Eyes
Diabolic Forces in a Ceremonial Union
And each Beast of the Land
took its own way in Living
the Seven forbidden things
were Eternally Desecrated
Kathaaria was Built
World without End
Face of the Goat in the Mirror
Eyes Burn like an October Sunrise
As Once they Gazed upon the Hillside
Searching for the Memories...
In the Shadow of the Horns
only seen by the Kings
of the Dawn of the First Millennium
upon the Thrones
In the Shadow of the Horns
Cleansed like the air in the Night
World Without End
we've become a Race of the Cursed Seeds
for five United Forces
in the Eternal Dawn
the Kings that held their heads high
The Triumph of chaos
Has Guided our Path
we Circles the holy Sinai
Our Swords Gave Wings
Invisible force of our Abyssic Hate
Our seeds Boil as we gaze upon the New Millennium
Weeping by the Graves of the Glorious Ones
so the hardened Frost Melts Away
Clouds Gather across a Freezing Moon
I kiss the Goat 
Witchcraft Still Breathes
I lay Enshrined
Contaminated Time Warp
My Flesh Yearns
For the Tombworld
My soul like layers of Frost
Simulating a Spectre Shadow
Frozen in Time and Space
I was Hacked out of Ice
Faded am I, behind a wall of consciousness
Still feeling a different World
Surrounding Me
Chilling Voices fill my head
I Open My Eyes
The Boiling Sea Beneath
The Castle of Faust
Belial finally Comes Forth:
The Ancient White light writings
were just lying men and their Pens
You are the same, only in Black.
Return with the knowledge
of making your own god
Dreamking of the Tombworld:
I Enter Into an Eternal Oath
Where Cold Wings Blow I was laid to Rest
I Can not reach my Rusty Weapons
the Blood and Sword that Guided my Path
for they Drowned in the Sands of Wisdom
I was, indeed, a King of the Flesh
My Blackened Edges; still they were Sharp
Honoured by the Carnal Herds
but asked thou: Closed are the Gates?
My Mind cut my Winged Weapons
and Teeth that was my Pride
And from the Forest all would hear:
Wisdom Opens the Gate for the King
My Weapons Sighted
My Tears they Tasted
Summon my Warriors
To the Land of Desire
To the Domain of Hate
Where Cold Winds Blew
For Lust for Hell
We Rode with the North Wind
Only I could accomplish a fucken Self-deceit
There are only Two Paths
the Mind or the Sword
And the Mind was Open like the Sights in a Dream
But the Sword was like a Stone around my neck
I Entered the Soul of the Snake
and Slept with the Armageddish Whore
but without my Throne and my Weapons;
Where Cold Winds Blow became my Grave
Hear a Haunting Chant
Lying in the Northern wind
As the Sky turns Black
clouds of Melancholy
rape the Beams
of a Devoid Dying Sun
and the Distant Fog approaches
Coven of forgotten Delight
Hear the Pride of a Northern Storm
Triumphant sight on a Northern Sky
Where the days are Dark
and Night the Same
Moonlight Drank the Blood
of a thousand Pagan men
It took ten times a hundred Years
Before the King on the Northern Throne
was brought Tales of the crucified one
Coven of renewed Delight;
A Thousand Years have passed since then
Years of Lost Pride and Lust
Souls of Blasphemy,
hear a Haunting Chant
We are a Blaze in the Northern Sky
The next thousand Years Are OURS
Horned Master of Endless Time
Summon thy Unholy Disciples
Trained for Centuries to Come.
Gather on the highest Mountain
United by Hatred;
The final Superjoint Ritual...
This, The Pagan Winter
Kept for the Obscure ones
Candles hold the only light
Sextons hide in Fear
For this Eternal Winter
A New God Ruled the Sky
The Million Hands Of Joy
Have something holy to Burn
From the top of the World one could see
The white light Servants Flee
Engulfed in an Infernal Cyclone
Created by our Blasphemy
Religious bodies Crossed the Sky
the Vision was our Wine
Roar of Fire, Feeble Fools
Into The Furnace Fire
Alcohol is in my veins...
Tears fall as I think of you.
The true memory you left me with
is a key to the wine of melancholy.
I drown myself in the deepest of sorrows
As you Burned on that stake they burnt
my soul as well.
Your pure feelings, your flaming hate;
it was not enough.
my beloved satanic witch,
The power in your eyes and yourself.
Worked for the noble in man.
Pass the bottle, pass the knife,
Pass me your unholy crafts.
I shall never forget you, the best
of all there is, I lick your cold lips,
I embrace your coffin as I sigh in woe.
You never kissed the priest, you never
Drank the blood of jesus. Weird, they say
well, turn it upside down like you did,
and they kill, kill, and they take you away...
Now, centuries later, I do yours and my sign.
You live in me, like you moved in with my soul.
Your resurrection is the spirit of you
Installed in me. So now, your thougths
and your pains are my wine;
I'll get these goddam angels drunk...
Come the raging chaos, rule power from your soul
Pure demoniac blessing as I kill myself in woe
Alls souls coloured the face of the moon
Shall suffer the eclipse
You must know that I can no longer see
The difference of dreams and reality
For the walls have been sieged
And conquered by our
Dark satanic blasphemy
I stand alone in a valley filled with starlight
My eyes suffer from eternal sparks
So shut the light and dream so I can see
The trident clearer than ever now
And in my darkest fantasy
And as I reach for hell
I am free...
Hearers are raising from the open sky
Meglomania reigns supreme
Chilled in horror
They learned how long to stand and pull
I head to receive
The lust and pain
Beat me Jesus
And we will win
I must embrace visual hell
To satisfy us
Rape the whores in blasphemy
I am man while I feast upon your flesh
Glance in my eyes
and see the eternal shadows dancing
Playing in the desert of my life
Burning
And my soul is descending.
Leader of all
face the apocalypse
You fools deep under the black rain
And nothing remains
Flowers to step on, flowers to burn
Am I ready for the god below
Red flesh to penetrate my skin
To send my soul away
To the grave I work
Until I'm feeling weak...
But there's fire
In my heart, in my eyes
In his body, in his eyes
And in his lonely kingdom
When the sun has died
When the angels are blind
When the fog lies thick
Over the Palace of god
When the fullmoon lights the earth
When the wolves gather in the open
When blood rains from the heaven high
And from the pearly gates
When Jehovas hordes are slaughtered
When disciples twelve are dead
When beliefs of easter land
Are raped and raped again
When the whore of Babylon rides
When pity turns to hate
When all sons of Satan
Sodomise the lambs of Christ
When the gates have all been opened
When the funerals never end
When Satan's power paint our hearts
And satisfies our souls
When witches burn the priests
When the Ancient Ones return
When demons ride the nuns
With their horns of dark desire
From the abode of demons
A wing of the pentagram
Comes the juice that painted
My heart and my soul
Swept in black they are
Swept in black I am
From this soul comes the eyes
That will look upon your ten
Beautiful heads with delight
My heart is the one
That will tend to your flames
And make them mine
We share this spirit
My heart is yours...
I am your disciple
And therefore my own
Your weapon I will be
With the demons that posesses me
We'll ride the seven sins of death
That takes me to Katharian
The sign of your horns
Is my dearest vision
They impale all holy and weak
You watch me face the mirror
And see desecration
With my art I am the fist
In the face of god
On the day of my final sacrifice
The chilling steel open my veins
Blood staines my skin
Silver chalice must be filled
Drinking the poisoned blood
I enter my shadowed coffin
Two goathorns in my hands
I raise my arms and close my eyes
To receive the infernal hails
From my brother in the land of the damned
The howling wind blows in the naked trees
Moonlit fields are glowing in the dark
Below me, the path to the cemetary
Where my spiritual brothers take me
They halt at the shadows of an oak
My nocturnal funeral commence
Lying in my blasphemous sleep
I am lowered down to the pit
A raven sings my last song
As the wolves howl their goodbyes
The funeral moon glows strongly now
For I am nearly there
This night of late october
The darkside open it's gate
Morbid souls wait for me
For satanic conspiracy
Flowers of doom
Rising in bloom
You will see
Our immortality!
Engulfed in frost
I sailed our dreams
Gloomy inner landscape comes to life
I am the wolf in the darkest scene
Phantasm sweep my role
I am lucifer, I bring you light and pride
Three steps for the white
A journey for the black
No flags for the ten lines
but I'll shoot you full of signs
In other dimensions
My visions grew black wings
You wouldn't know if I was him
The dragon rises before me
I'll fornicate the beast
Possess me as I burn
Into your painted realms
Flittermice of Eld Unveiled at the plenilune
Fordone by Mournful rest now seeking to be fed again
Rising terrestrial power umbraged by celestial light
That shines Forth from the palace of god
the palace of no return
Flittermice of Eld they peer into the morrows,
They peer the yesteryears as thoose are coming back.
Beholding the son recrucified, beholding gods race browbeaten,
Beholding the Devastation of all morals built by them.
Flittermice of Eld they fly to blaspheme yehova
and to build their Temple of the Damned on once holy pleasure ground
A Fare to Raise the Flag of Satan, to desseminate the races,
To build the Hall of Battle and to live in Eternal Strife
Flittermice came forth from the land beyond the forest
Multifarious Winged Black Creatures slew the angels up so high.
Devastation, Blasphemy, Desecration, Unholy He
who Burned the face of god with the Eye of Our Master
Transilvanian Hunger
cold soul
Your hands are cruel
to haunt... to haunt
the mountains are cold...
soul... soul...
careful... pale...
forever at Night
Take me... can't you feel the Call
Embrace Me Eternally in your daylight slumber
To be Draped by the Shadow of your Morbid Palace
oh, Hate Living...The only heat is warm blood
So Pure... So Cold
Transilvanian Hunger
Hail to the True, intense vampires
A story made for Divine fulfillment
To be the ones breathing a Wind of Sorrow
Sorrow and fright the dearest catharsis
Beautiful Evil Self to be the Morbid Count
A part of a Pact that is delightfully immortal
Feel the call freeze you with the uppermost desire
Transilvanian Hunger... my mountain is cold
So Pure... Evil, Cold
Transilvanian Hunger
Bearer of Sword
Stands beyond the Triumphant
As Eternal Night falls
On the Planet of almost full Void
Weaves War with a gesture of Might
Fallen are the Souls
Blinded by the Warrior Dreams
Finds the star invisible
To most of the regular Men and Slaves
And The Master serves Him
Leaves then for the Last Time
Finally His Castle
Monument of Misanthropy and Wrath
Hate
Loyal Friend of His Sober Hours
Treads on while the Faith Whips Sharp
Mental pain makes His Eyes Gleam
A light made of Dark Thrones and Frozen Winds
Now can leave the planet
Scent of the Flying Shadows
Are in the Eyes of the Vast Uranus
For these Eyes have seen
The horses of the Universe fade away
Oh, Father the Fog of Nebula
Your faithful children have escaped
The Walls of Eternity
The Elders Curse
Like Snow of the Solstice of the Sun
And what the Eyes of Uranus can see
Far Yonder in the Shade of the Walls
Was happening Millenniums ago
So whatever lies Beyond the Gate
It lies in the Past
Oh, We are the Hordes of Nebula
Having Travelled through an Eternal Sea of Void
We glance upon a distant light
Star in the Far; Ye Mighty Sun
Will you Die before We reach you?
Are you a Fatal result of the Laws of Distance?
The Swords of Time are pointing at our Hearts
The grass here seems Raped
As we face Eternal Misery
One man went to make a fire
His heart was burning, wild was his soul
In a battle where the father was forgotten, 
it became his lang, cold last winter
A great warrior, with a strangled mind
He was led into a foggy valley
From his Aryan palace
It is his last, long, cold last winter
Whitechrist and Jews are now celebrating
They thought that Odin would perish
But the battle has now begun
It is his last big honourable victory
When Hell Calls Your Name
There's No Way Back
And the Burning slaves
And the Burning holy
Will be seen from afar
As the New Risen Throne Star
And when the fires have Burned
Beholding the Seas of Ashes
And roll the Blooded flesh
On holy areas Now Cold
And Dead
And flowers Smell of Black
Now Emperor of No Light
And Pain
For the Eternal slaves
The envy of losers so indeed upon losers themselves
And destruction upon the holy man
Join us We Are the Future Now
Be Desecration Master
Be The Hammer
The Hammer
Eight miles deep the well forgotten by mortals
Oh, I drank it empty in one single sip
Eight miles wide the valley beyond all hope
Oh, I filled the whole with one single fist
Five million Christians on a ride towards us
Oh, I slaughtered the bunch with one single hit with my spear
Five million women so alone in the night
Oh, I had them all satisfied profusely every night by myself
Ten thousand trolls hard as rock cold as ice
Oh, they ran when I rose to face them
Ten hungry waves they swallowed my ship
Oh, I steadily walked home and I only got wet on my feet
No single book were beholden by me
Oh, no question I cannot do answer
Only one single lamp do show me this way
And that is the eye of Satan
Engulfed in frost
I sailed our dreams
Gloomy inner landscapes come to life
I am the wolf in the darkest scene
Phantasms sweep my role
I am Lucifer, I bring you light and pride
Three steps for the white
A journey for the black
No flags for the tens lines
but I'll shoot you full of signs
In other dimensions
My visions grew black wings
The dragon rises before me
I'll fornicate the beast
Come to me
Possess me as I burn
Into your painted realms
Come raging chaos
Rule power from your soul
Pure demoniac blessing
As I kill myself in woe
As souls coloured the face of the moon
Shall suffer the eclipse
You must know that I can no longer see
The difference of dream and reality
For the walls have been sieged
And banished by our Dark Satanic Blasphemy
I stand alone
In a valley filled with starlight
My eyes suffer
From eternal sparks
So shut the lids and dream so I can see
The trident clearer than ever now
And in my darkest fantasy
And as I reach for Hell
In my darkest fantasy
I reach for Hell
And I am Free...
Hearses are raining
From the open sky
Megolomania
Reigns supreme
Chilled in horror
They leaned too long to stand a fall
I bend to receive
The lust and pain
Beat me Jesus
And we will win
I must embrace visual hell to satisfy us
Rape the Whores in Blasphemy
I am Him while I feast upon your flesh
Glance into my eyes
And see the darkest shadows dancing
Playing in the desert of my life
Burning, and my soul is descending
Glance into my eyes
And see the darkest shadows dancing
Into the night
Lover of all
Face the Apocolypse
You fade away under the black rain
And flowers remain
Flowers to step on
Flowers to burn
Am I ready for the god below
Red flesh to penetrate my skin
To steel my soul away
To the grave I seek
Until I'm feeling weak
But there's fire
In my heart, in my eyes
In his body, in his eyes
And in his lovely kingdom
Daimon
It's been years
Daimon
Since I discovered the other world
The other world
Where shadows draped to our feet
Evil
Possess me
I pretend
But daemons
I can only
Dream of
In coldness and darkness
I know I'm possessed
Bodies
Are what we all see
Dead or alive
We're alive
But our truth is dead
Invisible
For all to see
Demon
When it's cold and dark
Possess me
More and more
Now
Now that I'm through with you
My black wings have gone
But remember
When you smile
You forget the pain inside
The feeling you all hate
I'm there to bring it
In another world
Have you ever been true
That's what you know I have
You feel I hurt
You feel that I have
Take me to the thornfields
I gave birth
To my astral
Upon this earth
Don't you ever walk my way
I walk alone
I am the fountainstorm from a black heart
I am the desert of redemption
I soar on dead wings of sin
I am pre-nun with a cracked virginity
The arrows of moderation failed to hit me
But the ones who came with fear and hate
Kissed me deep long and hard
And those who spelled DEATH are so ready
Paler skin than the sheets of Jewish fairytales
Is sown upon every soul and body of life
And I wonder who sees desolation
Through my eyes, holds the vision
And makes love to it
We sail the seas, of negativity
to banish kindness from this place
To behold the fierceness of wolves
assailing ye saints thoroughly
To behold the wails of thine in affright
whilst evil preyeth upon thy hearts
To behold a world, darkly astir
rising in madness and mystery
Would ye not rather fall into pleasant reverie
Than to tremble amidst, this old memory?
Alas for the damned thou art...now ye behold!
Tis the rise of satanic divinity...
Oh we rejoice at the destruction
of all ye have ever lived for...
Hark! as lands tremble, and empires fall
Ye may hear us laugh with sardonic wrath
tis the voices from the past
Aye we can not mourn, for
never morrow shall dawn
World without end...
The urge.. so strong
To do the devil's work.
The flock of jesus christ
I will rape your souls
till you see the devil clear
Blackwinged
Evil wings bring torture from the skies
With a limb so huge,
to serve you christian sluts
Penetrate your pure cunts with might
Now you filthy cunts, do you see the moon?
Its glowing for the black wings return
Blackwinged
We'll burn your worthless bodies
and send the fire and stench
to heaven high, Remind your worthless
god, that our victory is complete
Clean this earth of holy bitches
Desecrate mother mary
Blackwinged
Brothers of north, brothers of doom
Ravens has spoke. The attack must begin
The shadows of our warrior souls
will float with infernal speed
Souls of christ, prepare for fight
We'll crush your halls with bonecrushing
might supreme
Your feeble cries will not be heard
Since your god lies dead and buried
In the ruins of the pearly gates
Brothers of north, brothers of doom
Endlessnights of total war
Coming closer
Gather, Hell is calling...gather
Gather for attack on the pearly gates.
Fire
Fire I greet Thee
Give life to shadows grim
So that they may writhe where you dwelt
In life, now dead within
Once mother of all life
Now raped by death
To breed the brethren of black fire
Destruction!
In claw-controe
Neverending bleakness
In the sight of the undead
Black desert of ashes
Under a dark clouded sky
Given shelter to flesheating flames
Starved since creation
Reign from skeleton thrones
The realm of the beast
Black victory of death
No life in this funeral beast
Desolate winter lifeless
Landscape
Halls of north frozen
Eagles and ravens domain
One-eyed master silently
Awaits to strike at dawn
Hordes will fight and come
forth from dark hidden places
Ready to kill
March to war, for the eternal
Northern Sky
In the quest for shudders I was as the absence
melted in my hand
As clear as my gleaming sorrow
A spectral fascination
For irony to serve
are the glorious those who triumph
in a kingdom of eternity?
a castle of sand
whose roof has sheltered my
I sense the absence of triumph and lust
abruptly rising to cover the glory in sand
A whore gave birth to the flies
who flew away with my beauty
A virgin gave birth to my masks
I simulate the absence
To enter a kingdom of
flesh - a ghastly worn shadow
A fiery picture of poet in hell
Forlorn I was as poets should be
I am as chosen as the weaver himself.
Feel the burning flame
as the sun in the desert sand
Sense tghe grief as the knives of torment
Shreds your soul
Behold the harvest storm of spiritual rape
Hordes from infernal wastelands united
Under blackened wings
Souls under the serpents banner
with common flesh
But a heart of scorn and painfull anger
Orgy of destruction 
a gesture of might
Gaze at the grey sky
hatred and poison
And from the vast towers of the underworld
one could see shadows of Them in dark
caves and endless halls
Trample down bronze gate of tartaros
Patient earthly men with raised bloodfilled chalices
Greeting Their arrival for the battle of the
ages is at hand and when the garish slave
of the seeds of life has turned into a
torrent of blood and the wolf has eaten the sheep
Stare into the galactic fog
armageddon has been achieved

You don't want to encourage me
Slowly corroding your fortified norm
Leaving you bitter, grim and sober
With rigid cramp or silent fear
I strangle what you do hold dear
With rigid cramp or silent fear
evoking addiction, limp, severe
It's sin again
Like charcoal on flaming nuns
Consistence unknown

Norway be my grave
Increasingly insecure
Combine with stagnant joy
Half my life in your name
Fucked up and ready to die
Death just takes a moment
Suffering is forever
Let's leave this sinking ship together
The water of life will fill your lungs
Drink 'till you bleed
When contradictions fail to soothe
Half my life in your name
Fucked up and ready to die
Murder only takes a moment
It'll last you forever
Divided we stand
Unlocked and insecure
To be all open wounds
Down there I see you
No no, further
Feebly twinkling
Stellar filth
Redeemers wacked up like suicide
I'm out of my cage
no time for scars now
I'm being fed

How many hasn't cursed the wall
Striving for a piece of Lucifer
Don't you know it can never be digested ?
I've noticed a certain lack of demons lately
And it really worries me sick
Let's see who stands when the somke clears
Keep kicking that litter our way
We ain't about to throw the fight here
We all shall die
No sense of sublime estetics
No clue about obscure origins
So high on centerfold wisdom
Some tombs will never be silent
Let's see who stand when the smoke clears
Keep kicking that litter our way
We ain't about to throw the fight here
We all shall die
Sinking deeper into the fabric
Investing more in the movement
Facing east
Skin them alive
Scar tissued shadows
Grease factories for weapons

Hail the new born king
Join the dead join the dead
Beautiful goat regime

My empty stare just might make you

Creepy and lost in a fucked up head

A soundtrack to the wHory nuns

Revel in the glory of system failure
When arrogance marries power
Conceal with the coak of philanthope
Let the stinking dogs lie
Evil takes all sides
Fast and untouchable
True, hard, raw, and crusty
Underdogs and overlords
True, hard, raw, and crusty
Underdogs and overlords
Evil takes all sides
Fast and untouchable
True, hard, raw, and crusty
Underdogs and overlords
Revel in the glory of system failure
When arrogance marries power
Conceal with the coak of philanthope
Let the stinking dogs lie
Fucking forced to sleep
In this life
Enough time to be sober
In death
Brandish the brandy
Shrouds wave in fury
Raise the fever pitchers
To our glorious demise
Withdrawl trembling
This, the black weapon
Hear the roaring sensation
Of my fucking flamboyant wake
The secular tyranny
Informer of God
Yes, we earn a lot
By your ethical Machochism
You feel powerless
You shall not have
Other Gods than me
No forms of totalitarian thinking
Hand In hand
With a stagnating disarmament
For fucks sake!
You point out counterfactual cronicles
You should be fed to the living dead of Nairobi
You feel powerless
You shall not have
Other Gods than me
The secular tyranny
Informer of God
Yes, we earn a lot
By your ethical Machochism
Shut Up, Shut Up
I'll stick to my guns
Now you stick to yours!
Sit Down
Let's not pretend
That I'll have to use force
Are you Satan?
I don't think so
You copy my style
And you call yourself a man
You want a piece of me?
you do
Begging for this and asking for that
Shut Up, Fucking Twat
Shut Up, Shut Up
I'll stick to my guns
Now you stick to yours
Sit Down
Let's not pretend
That I'll have to use force
Are you Satan?
I don't think so
You copy my style
And call yourself a man
Never could fathom my hate
Unable to take a hint
Who am I? You haven't got a clue
Satanism is lost on you
The black weapon
War to prevent war
The dance of Narcissus
With cancelled armies
Victims, do your job
Die now for your own good
Glorious fear worship
Don't mess with nothingness
Everything is bigger than you think
and you are smaller
The art of burning bridges
Hooked on greed
The negative way of evil
The failure of humanism
Paving your way to misery
I laugh as you run astray
The art of burning bridges
Hooked on greed
Too many fools blocking my motion
Clouding my eyes... must be the potion
Spots on my eyes... must be the lotion
Love in a void... it's so numb
Avoid in love... it's so dumb
Love in a void
Too many bigots for my liking
Too many critics... too few writing
Rabid dogs that just ain't biting
Love in a void... it's so numb
Avoid in love... it's so dumb
Love in a void
Jaded reputation on which you're staking
Lots of money for the making
For all the stars they're just faking
Love in a void... it's so numb
Avoid in love... it's so dumb
Love in a void
Seeking fortune on these shores
I ridicule your hopes
Parasite in the realm
To be wiped away
You're doomed in that valley
Raised cages of cold
Wait for the next wave
The plague is here again
No dignity at all
Yes, you have been waste
And they will freeze, the night away
With my turning winds of high
You die a parrot state
I ride the wasteland
Powered by the will to deny
Seeking, fortune on these shores
I ridicule your hopes
Parasites in the realm
To be wiped away
You're doomed in that valley
Raised cages of cold
Wait for the next wave
With my brutal winds of night
You die a parrot state
I ride the wasteland
Powered by the will to deny
The will to deny
If you think my castle
Is built on sand
Well bring on the tides
You can fuck off and die
If you think my patience
Is ocean vast
Or river deep
You can fuck off and die
Fuck off and die!
If you think my pain
Is well preserved
Then go ahead and try
You can fuck off and die
Fuck off and die
Far away from you
Disgusting subhuman fuck
You think you rule the world
Up my ass, tough luck!
I have my world here
You think you are right
But you can't touch me here
The forest is cold and white
Maximum distance to your idiocy
While you read and study a book
Yes, you are in many and crazy
Like flies to a pile of shit
I have my world here
You think you are right
You can't fool me now
My world is cold and white
Far away from you,
Disgusting subhuman fuck
You think you rule the world
Up my ass, tough luck!
I have my world here
You think you are right
But you can't touch me here
The forest is cold and white
Maximum distance to your idiocy
While you read and study a book
Yes, you are many and crazy
Like flies to a pile of shit
You had Atlantis
You know that now
What can you see
From Valhalla's heights?
Perceive the glitches
Praise the glaciers
The final remnants
Of our key of greatness
You have the wisdom of the dead
These lesser lights should learn from you
Washed clean by ice
For lust our summers
For souls our winters
Until we die
In the depths of the underground
Through the nurseries of real metal sound
Governing the molten core
No more slavery anymore
We are older and wiser and the underground thrives
In a seance of insanity with maniacal screams
Our time of visit is over
And over again
Kneedeep in false idols
Demonic fairytales, prophets of nothing
The great death of all oaths
Burn you all into oblivion
Poisoned to admire our race
Poison all of your ideas
Putting the final end to it all
Breathing out the mantra
Past present and future prophets
Mould into meatball
My sole fire in vast forest
Nibble slowly, cosmos watching
The great death of all oaths
Burn you all into oblivion
Sound of iron, hard at work
Flames of triumph, we'll get
Keep that hammer pounding
The autumn of no regret
Keep our mountains free
Our shores clean of thee
Blacksmith of the north
Ancient fire is burning in me
The black rain is harsh
But they will learn
Our fathers of old
Not hearing the yearns
Those Cold Nights are back again
Norway Morning greet my daily toil
That Old familiar smell
Fallen leaves return to our Soil
From the First Day it has been with Me
Since My First steps Outsite it's been there
Nok en Skumring Levd for Siste Gang
Autumn Leaves I'm back Again
The Altar has broadened
Vast Plains of it now
20 years of Contemplating
Hating...
The Larger the Life, the Closer is Death
Drastic Duties cloak my mind
In darkness they can't see my game
All walls are drawing nearer
Keep on pushing, I'll be born again
Courtmarshalled for doing my job
Bitterness scraping at my thoughts
The stupid eyes of the world are watching
I will never cave in
In the cerebral abyss
The grizzly trade thrives
Unpleasant necessities
Uh, mandatory pain
I laugh at your distorted accusations
You're not worthy
See the blazing truth in these eyes:
You'll be judged by me on the other side
Shaken and stirred in the dungeons!
Why is it you find yourself there?
Left in the mud without a torch
a fruitless endeavour and no one cares!
no they don't
Seen stumbling around in darkness
questioning honours and dreams
Those treasures will never befall you
they're out of reach
Crawling out at the foot of the mountain
Even weaker than when you entered!
When you have no soul and guidance is none, 
there's no use in being self-centered!
Seen stumbling around in the darkness
questioning honours and dreams
then those treasures will never befall you
they're out of reach for you!
Drowned in stellar dust
We create beginning and end
Crumbles constantly
We know the center of End
Who are you on stage?
Breathe deeply
Lungs filled with waste
Running for borders
Helpless heart
Pumping fuel, veins splintered
Thoughts divided
Building up chaos
Torn from haven
Answers never come
Floating wisdom
Ancient in its purest form
Gravitate towards center
Visuals fade
This is the realm of power
Stellar detonations
Universe is gloating, hovering
Judge, jury and executioner
Now freeze
Veins injected with time
Walk around, like royalty
Just a stylized corpse
Life has reached the end
On the inside
Proud of what you have achieved
You'll soon see the truth, I'll show you
Grabbing my tools, I firmly believe
I'm your saviour and icon
Chain you to the wall
Blowtorch literally open your eyes
You feel superior now?
All you can do, is imagine my world
Let the chipmunks feast on your heart
Oh, this luxury life
All the juices of lies
Doesn't smell like a bowl of fruit
But I am strong and brute
Send you back among the dead
No one will see that you're born again
I'm your saviour, and I made your day
Sleeping in a pool of human debris
You're scanning the landscape...
You feel like a true pioneer
As Romans you conquer
On top of your fear
just hope you awaken in time
And know that you are on my mind
Look over your shoulders 
you're blind!
And circle the wagons
20 years later
I take you apart
You're asking
you're asking why?
I have no heart!
just hope you awaken in time
And know that you are on my mind
Look over your shoulders
you're blind!
And then!
Circle the wagons
I am in a mountain cave
The night is playing outside
Seas yonder swim in starlight
Swirling fires grace the plains
There are treasures the night can't hide
And within me things no sun can see
This is where I stood my ground
opened gates for you and me
For each day that passes
I see more and more
Sometimes the universe opens
and the soul cries, hoarse and sore
Still I live for those moments
At least the ancient ones stand by my side
No matter how the human plagues weighs heavy
Night on earth can harbour eternal pride
Struggled to awake for eons, merciless fate
Fingers moving, twisting sickly, silence is broken
Air is dead in this cave, dead as murdered
Only 10 feet crawling to get outside, black night
Hysterical laughter is hammering the stone walls
Ears bleeding
depressed
Overcoming psychical nightmares, starts crawling
Fingers broken, don't fucking care, move on
Outside the air is clean, cold and still
Eyes are open now, to see this dead night
Attacked by sudden fear, unknown constellations
Are threatening from above
Shivering cold, damaged brain, bleeding the blood
Alas, Deathstar is rising, finally to see this place
It gets brighter, hurting my eyes, can I bear this pain?
As my Deathstar is rising above the hills, my eyes burst
Pain so strong, havocing my head, it's dark again
In within circle unbound
Ripping roots from holy ground
Laying bare where needs sown
Caring nothing but my own
Can not cope pull the rope
Posers in breeding
Sown why bleeding
Damned ones destroy hope
Claim claims even forgotten
Resurrection carry back and forth
Begone stalemate and treason
Initiate the corrosive birth
The empty scraping
Wombs outbled, frozen
All terrain and no direction
You Crawl towards your own dissection
Against these files
You're necro civilization
The debris he makes
Chapels from the deep call my name
You will not understand
The age of sickness from beyond the wasteland
Breathe in trash clean and natural
I believe you to bask in confusion
Our answer will remain justified
Run, now run around
The circles will not be broken
A death of my own, your necro civilization
The debris he makes alone
Chapels from the deep call my name
Drink the drink clean and natural
I believe you to bask in confusion
Run, now run around
The circles will not be broken
Against the mind, the boreal scepters
Hissing hollowly, gnawing rocks
Boulder shield dispersed by ice
Wailing souls threshed by nature's temptress
Where to find their shelter
Where to find their sparks
Where to build and live
And returns the sun's energy
Once again
Boreal fiends
Rest your shoulders and take in
Your cold and lonely dreams
Some witnessed the birth of pine
There was game to be had
Some died alone under the stars
For all this we are grateful
Where to find their shelter
Where to find their sparks
Where to build and live
And returns the sun's energy
Once again
Boreal fiends
Rest your shoulders and take in
Your cold and lonely dreams
Weak minded inbred vermin
Call for the pesticide
Time will smoke out the rats
Breed like swarms getting weaker by the minute
People rotted on mountains
Running around with no clue
Freezing they're ice cold
Killed by their own plague
They will rot in the winds of the utter cold
We deny your rights to live
Vermin, filth, blood in streams running
For the edge of extension
People rotted on mountains
Running around with no clue
Frigid they're ice cold
Weak minded inbred vermin
Yonder and forlorn
Lies the arctic thunder
Beneath the astral fires
Again the moon expires
Forgotten tomb sayer speaks
Here, above and under
The night shifts, sudden drifts
The destroyer
Paralyzed
Rest my eyes
Wallowing shores asunder
Arctic thunder
Piece these things together
Bear mark of atomic strength
Find those piercing ripples
Defy wretched lands and aws
Bring the thrive of glorious mornings
Bring sacrifice to life
Tear up the clouds at sunset
Merge the slow divide
For the arctic thunder
Carry me through thick and secret walls
Wedge me into stone
Throw me through the marshes
Hide me in the dreams of the blind
Drag you screaming through my ignorant bliss
Fly you under each lake
Pedestal you in caves and dungeons
And engulf us in bone
These are the blue collared masonists
Yearning for transparent reign
Constructor of nine worlds
Built by force of bitter refusal
He had something to show you
A dramatic ancient slab in the mountains
A fragment of your life, it follows
Clings on towards that dying day
Deathbed
Once again roaming those plains of mine
You should not have entered
Control and lose control and rein 'em back in
I howl at the treelines while you see only night
I've built a Wyoming distance
A hole on the ridgeline this month
Every fiber all my life
Why am I the light to your moth
Angrily viewing the horizon smoke
Looks like I'll hunt a little while longer
I like it when the rays peer through the branches
Then tunneling back to the ranch unheard
I've built a Wyoming distance
Line them up - it's you and me
My every fiber all my life...
Made the fence you now taste
I muffle your inner choir
Rehearsing twisted screams
Level the jesters dream
Numbening your live wire
Click your shit boots together
We are not in hell anymore
In the land of the blind
The one eyed man is dead
Stew hack disagree
Brew the divine sweat
Eat the forest alive you unman
Pollute the entrails
Click your shit boots together
We are not in hell anymore
In the land of the blind
The one eyed man is dead
You buy your home
And follow a dream
No politics here
Just self esteem
A heart warms up
To where you feel home
No bastard rule of religion
Soil surrounds the stone
You get nothing for nothing
And souls do not exist
There is a concept of doom
Nature abhors a vacuum
the hardship of the scots
The old star dies for us all
An equator of tragedy
Stick out your fistfuls of hope
And out there in the fringes
The caravans are going in loops
Oblivious to the old star
while atlas cringes
Juggle your fears in the shadows
of altars to the diminishing beacon
No need to circle those wagons, even
The fingerless marble play ensues
And out there in the fringes
The caravans are going in loop
Oblivious to the old star
While atlas cringes
Paying for forests you separated
Atoning for hiding the rivers
Mankind dies
In a shroud of introvert mumbling
Half-hearted black-hearted rams
Interstellar fugitives
Doing their bit for the universal dam
Coined is the black metal prairie
Sharing your weapons
Will it lead to its dullness
Will you buy better ones?
Will they be forlorn?
Will you need a receipt, bounty hunter?
Your trade eventually took you to Swiss alps
Carefree void of everything, then might
High watcher; inner fear of scalping edges
This and these
Tear jerking calamities
Stuffed tightly with earth-like fears
Solemn shit no one hears
Prairie seems like a good choice now
The crimson sky is the limit
Although chances ahead are scarce
The racket is rigged as you die
Too old to wring the secret from the master
The well you encountered as a child
Merely acknowledging the beacon now
And now you are not well any longer
So this is the pact of the gloat
Double hell for all
All to repair and one to watch
No freedom in these domains
Hail the satan
Sinister duke of gloat
Wrap up the wretched fates
Intriguing eternal laughter
Encyclopedias
Of endless futile life toils
Shrapnel wounds
From shattered inner gargoyles
So this is the pact of the gloat
Brave beating hearts, But
All must repair while one beholds
No freedom in these domains
The key is inside the wall
Every wall. Every way
Every minute. You don't understand
Dying reveals the wish
Wishing is the beyond
A seance is beyond
Talk to the four keys
Lock yourself in
Confused isolation heroics
Chilled concern fragments
Morbid kaleidoscope draws you in
Stigmata of satan pulls you out
Downbeaten souls, bowed heads
Competance of guardians impotent
Glorious idiots of the flesh
Stake out the danger in our heads
Walk free but mind your fingers
Thought you would fly away with satan
Fingers able. Just stumps now
The key is inside the wall
With a crucifix I smash her body
The deformation is grotesque
My passion crawls for your flesh
The ritual can begin
Turn the cross upside down
Into her bleeding cunt
Urinate in her mouth
Hack and fuck for supper
Blackest
Ecstasy
Beyond the boundaries
of pleasure
Sucking out eating raw flesh
Fuck you whore we burn in blasphemy
For sex I'll use her lovely head
Delightful orgasm so deep in me
Blackest
Ecstasy
Beyond the boundaries
of pleasure
I spill out blackest blood
Prepare your return this place you'll never leave
Evil thoughts full of perversion
What a beautiful view when I scratch your bones
Pushed down the stairs built of coffins
Morbid fear in the dungeons
Tied to the rack 
knife across your breasts
Beaten and strangled brutal shattered chest
Suffocate in blood
Extorted confession
Intense excruciatoin
Total evisceratoin
Await the execution
Nail driven into your eyes
Crucifix pressed to your forehead
Evil exorcised
Fucked by the bishop in front of a laughing crowd
Forced down on your knees
Swallow holy cum
Torn out vagina
sawed off limbs
Glowing iron in your anus
broken on the wheel
Ripped to shreds
Extorted confession
Intense excruciatoin
Total evisceratoin
Await the execution
Now you are carried to the pyre
Soon to be released
Purity through fire
Walk the way of the hunter
Not the fucking victim
Take your own decisions
Follow your path
Hail misanthropy
hail nihilism
Behind the black moon
We praise satanics rebirth
Extreme extinction rages on without mercy
Battlefield chaos distor their souls
Behind the black moon
Taste unholy water and scream
Apocalypse will return
The sun turns into everlasting blackness
Dark centuries will arrive soon
Awake them and glorify
Their purebred blood
Behind the black moon
We praise satanics rebirth
Extreme extinction rages without mercy
Battlefield chaos distort their souls
Behind the black moon
Nail the christ
Blood above us
Black crucifixion of their god
Fesselt und geiþelt den Dornentrager
Black crucifixion of their god
Man effnet ihm die Seite
Nocturnal orgy of flesh
the sabbath of blood
Mighty ritual of honour 
The sabbath of blood
Desecrating with possessed burning eyes
hell has risen 
the gods of pain
Pull the veins
tear out the rotted soul
take the last breath
snuff out the life
No resurrection
Massacrate the lord of the weak
Buried blessings
Destroy the remains of Christ
In the burnt out chruches
They stand awaiting their doom
Indulge in their blood
Sepulture of hypocrisy
Light of holiness
Forever now extinguished
Edure eternal pain
You foolish ghost of god
A dislodged angel glide onto
Cold replacing blindness
Wash the rain away
Yearning for spraying posion
The requiem of the antichrist
Far away from the sun
The requiem of the antichrist
Create hell on earth
bath in warm blood is her promised
Renounce the frosting death
Icer at the enslaved
Crying dying fearing gods
The requiem of the antichrist
Far away from the sun
The requiem of the antichrist
Create hell on earth
Take these almight wings and fly away
Again and again and again
You bring me to ecstasy
You have died but I don't care
Burial place is not your true relief
Fistfucks in your backdoos hole
Necropenetrating lust takes command
Path of sin
Create the sin
In darkness we'll always be together
Forever your body belongs to me
Wrapped in pleasure we will burn
In eternity we shall be reborn
Path of sin
Create the sin
Mutilated on the cross
Blackness covered the bastards flesh
Hear the trumpets of hell
See the fire through my eyes
Black winged angel
Reborn in chaos
Unholy sins inside my other hell
Praise the lord of disrespect
Let them die in their own curse
Because they don't feel
Black winged angel
Reborn in chaos
In the purgatory of sin
Swear the oath of blood
The black mighty raven
Picks for the eyes of jesus
Black winged angel
Reborn in chaos
Glory on your worm eaten head
Foul air escapes your lying mouth
Tyranny throughout the centuries of pain
Blinded zombies followed into the decline
Kneeling in a stinking church
Crawling before an image of god
Obliteration of adoration
Burn the scriptures
fuck your obnoxious sermons
Shove the host
up your sanctimonious rectums
Son of stench
oppressor of vice
Castrated savior
king of imbecility
We press the thorns deeper into thy rancid body
Perennial torture
get raped by our sins
Deride the martyrs of their crumbling dogmas
Devoted vermin poisoned with impurity
Shoot the servants of this rotten kingdom
Abomination is the wages idolatry
Shed the blood of christ
vomit upon the cross
Kneeling... 
crawling...
Praying... 
Dying...
Oh, unholy wings of death
Ceremony of darkness
Feel the kisses of the whip
Carnal excess
evocation is done
Diabolical possession
Wrapped in blasphemy
Diabolical possession
Deny christian slave morality
Adore my mighty sin
Drown the host in excrements
Immortality of dark desire
Adore my mighty sin
In the sing of the antichrist
Immortality of dark desire
Defecate on the altar of lies
Spoil the back of the goat
Voluptuosly vaginal explosions
Premature embryos
dancing in fire
Diabolical possession
Wrapped in blasphemy
Diabolical possession
Deny christian slave morality
Adore my mighty sin
Drown the host in excrements
Immortality of dark desire
Adore my mighty sin
In the sing of the antichrist
Immortality of dark desire
Crucified image of god
I deserve your warm blood
Fuck your holy flesh
Use my cock anal
Lick my unholy cum
Submit your juicy hole
Beg for fresh urin
Bleed for satan
Lust perishes in a thirst for blood
Swallow my unblessed piss
Beautiful nazarene whore
My dick spreads cold disease
Seduced through passion
Of the sinful snake
Ass and cunt breathe no more
Lust perishes in a thirst for blood
I consume your bloodred delightful breast
Your magnificent toes are my dessert
In bonds kneedeep you bath in my sin
Necrofuck is your destiny
Contempt for christianity knows no limit
The so-called chosen people can fuck off
Brutal treatment is now unleashed
Annihilation of the christians
The man who has never been in the clutches
Of a crushing riper
Can never know what its poison is
Sirens roars

Bullshit culture

Every crossing between two breeds spreads disease

Primal force of nature's core
Fill me now, gimme more
Instincts must yield to the magickal rule!
I am rooted
I am perfect
I am ready
I open my arms, legs wide apart
Touch the five points
The shape is complete
Every man and every woman is a star
I am the giver
I am the taker
I am the receiver
Bigger than life
I embrace a star
Fueling its core
to burn ever more
Emotionless passion
simple and cruel
I enter the flesh to please myself
Creating and growing within my own skin
Somewhere in time we were born,
And brought blood, lust, hatred and scorn,
Your sorry now you trusted me,
Now I command that you get down on your knees
Hell the deceiver,
Satan's child,
Your a believer,
And we're going wild.
Put away all your virtues,
Stop your climbing the walls,
Just sign your name on the paper,
We'll have ourselves a ball.
Was it the battle of envy,
You were so mighty and brave,
But your foolish compulsions,
Sent you to the grave.
Hell has deceived you,
You were so blind,
Just like all mortals,
You'll loose your mind.
Hell has deceived you,
You were so blind,
Join venoms legions,
Cause we're going wild.
Fight, we will fight right,
Living low in a world of our own,
Destined to live right, fight,
We're taking hell as our home,
Burning lives burning,
Asking me for the mercy of god,
Ancient cries crying,
Acting fast upon the way of the dog,
Welcome to hell,
Kill 
we will kill death,
Masturbating on the deeds we have done,
Hell commands death kill,
Argue not of feel the death of sun,
Burning lives burning,
Asking me for the mercy of god,
Ancient cries crying,
Acting fast upon the way of the dog,
Welcome to hell,
Leave your souls at his feet,
Kiss the flames,
Scorn defeat.
Die we won't die live,
Our choice of difference is what you'll never know,
Mortal voids live die,
Buried deep beneath the fall of the snow,
Burning lives burning,
Asking me for the mercy of god,
Ancient cries crying,
Acting fast upon the way of the dog,
Welcome to hell
Children gather around him,
Mystery surrounds him,
What terrible secret does he hide,
An ordinary man,
Doing what he can,
But what goes on inside his mind.
The night draws nigh,
With darkened sky's,
Axe blade shines,
Midnight chimes.
Morning comes around,
Headless bodies found,
Our little friend just sits and smiles
Take them home and love them,
Read the bible to them,
Be sure to kiss each one goodnight.
But come the night,
You'll freeze with fright,
Axe drawn high,
Another dies.
Creeping and searching for victims unknowing,
What fate doth await round each corner,
The take in the night,
He's got you in his sight.
Now that I have warned you,
Always look behind you,
You'll never know just who'll be there,
That harmless looking dear,
May be the one to fear,
So never trust those you don't know.
But come the night,
You'll freeze with fright,
Axe drawn high,
The bastards die.
Your love is infectious,
Your rotten to the core,
Everybody knows what you got,
But they still come back for more,
Your everybody's favourite,
You give them all a good time,
Your loves a total disaster,
But when they sign the dotted line they're,
Poisoned
One night with you and you've got me,
Poisoned,
Making love with the devils daughter,
Poisoned,
One night with you and you've got me,
Poisoned,
That dirty little bitch has got me,
Poisoned.
Sitting close beside me,
Hand upon my zip,
Don't bother to take it down, honey,
It's about to rip,
She's mammy's little virgin,
Her daddy's all in pride,
But she welcomed me with opened legs,
Kept me satisfied.
Tell me that you love me,
Say you'll never leave,
The more I give the more you take,
The more that you receive,
I got you down beneath me,
Open wide
I'm gonna make you pay for all,
The times you've cheated and lied.
Every night I'm in a different town,
I'm the kind that likes to get around,
Living fast I'm on the run,
I take my chances because I'll only die young.
Live like an angel die like a devil,
Got a place in hell reserved for me,
Live like an angel die like a devil,
Gonna burn in hell that's where I'm gonna be.
I got no worries I don't care what I do,
I'm gonna walk all over you,
Loving hard and getting high,
Hell's the place I'm gonna die.
You hear me coming just get out of my way,
I'm here tomorrow and I'm gone today,
The path I'm heading got no easy track,
I got the devil riding on my back.
Come hear the moon is calling,
The witching hour draws near,
Come hear the bell is tolling,
Mortals run in fear,
Prepare the altar now and hear the virgin cry,
Hold fast the sacrafice,
For now it's the time to die,
All hell breaks loose,
Hell's breaking loose.
Unveil the pentagram,
And feel the demons lust,
Come watch the holy men,
Who look on in disgust,
Come taste blood,
And feel the heat of satan's breath,
Look in the sky's and see,
The warriors of death,
All hell breaks loose,
Hell's breaking loose,
Witching hour.
Our work is now complete,
The blood runs fast and free,
And satan takes his bride,
And cry's of blasphemy,
All hell rejoices at the child,
That she will bear,
And satans only son,
Shall be the worlds despair,
All hell breaks loose,
Hell's breaking loose,
Witching hour.
Unholy city a sinners delight
No-one was spared out of mind, out of sight
Hatred and slaughter, degredation and lust
Self destruction never counting the cost,
No-one knew the suffering
Behind the city walls
No-one heard the cry for help
No-one heard the call
One thousand days in sodom
One thousand days in sodom
The ways of god forgotten
One thousand days in sodom
Children slaughtered daily there mothers by their sides
No mercy given no matter how they cried
The smell of death was near
It's presence ever near
The priests lay bound in chains no-one would ever hear,
No-one knew the blasphemy
The torture and the pain
No-one saw the madness
The priests, they died in vain
Day completes its cycle and night takes on its role
Satan's cloak shrouds the land and his children spill their fold
No golden cross of heaven
Or ancient key of kings
Could save the world of sinners when the midnight sabbath rings
Few could hear the suffering
And the pain of ripping flesh
But those who did were damned in hell
And breathed their final breath 
One thousand days
One thousand years you've lived your life in hell.
Living
Running,
Out on the streets at night,
Searching,
Hoping,
For the right connection, coz',
Need it, want it,
You know I've got to have it,
Takes me higher than anything I know.
Angel Dust,
Need a shot to see me through the day,
Angel Dust,
Want a lot I've got to get away.
I live my life,
Like there's no tomorrow,
Take no chances
I'm drowning all my sorrows coz' I,
Need it, want it,
You know I've got to have it,
Takes me higher than anything I know.
Laughing,
Crying,
Every night and day,
I know,
You know,
You know I've got to have it,
Takes me higher than anything I know.
I'm in league with Satan
I was raised in hell
I walk the streets of Salem
Amongst the living dead
I need no one to tell me
What's wrong or right
I drink the blood of children
Stalk my prey at night
Look out beware
When the full moon's high n'bright
In every way I'm there
In every shadow in the night
Coz I'm evil in league with Satan
Evil in league with Satan
I'm in league with Satan
Obey his commands
With the goat of Mendes
Sitting at his left hand
I'm in league with Satan
I love the dead
No one prayed for Sodom
As the people fled
I'm in league with Satan
I am the masters own
I drink the juice of women
As they lie alone
I'm in league with Satan
I bear the devils mark
I kill the new born baby
Tear the infants flesh
I have been to Hell and back
kissed satanic Queen
Traveling at the speed of light
saw thing never seen
Arm in arm with Lucifer
Belial on my back
I have swam the lake of flames
walked forbidden tracks
To Hell and back
To Hell and back
I've made love to Lilleth fair
danced the zombies dance
I have shook the reapers hand
broke his deathly trance
Present at ungodly births
mutants writhe in pain
I'm possessed by Hell itself
I'm the man insane
To Hell and back
To Hell and back
Ride with me
To Hell and back
You can take a trip with me
Hell's my final home
If you wish to live at night
watch the demons room
Holding high the Southern Cross
watch the mortals bleed
Drink the blood and feel my wrath
watch the mutants breed
To Hell and back
To Hell and back
I'm alive but dead, awake but asleep
As friend gather round and mourners they weep
My mind thinks of all the things I have done
My body is cold but my heart beat goes on
And on and on
As they lower me down into that hole in the ground
I scream out for help but they hear not a sound
I tear at the lid, my fingers they bleed
Is this happening to me or is it just a dream
Summon the dead
Baphomet's call
Blood on my hands
Let me out of here
My bones are decayed, my flesh it rots
I'm lying in silk, take the lid off this box
My lungs gasp for air, my eyes scream for sight
I promise the rise of my body this night
Summon the dead
Baphomet's call
Blood on my hands
Screaming in torment
I'm felling you all
Take heed of my plea
Answer my call
I'm gonna be free
Rising from my deadly tomb I've got
maddened eyes with fright
fingers bleeding fast heart beating
the moons my only light
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
If God won't have me, then the Devil must
we will raise the dead
stop at nothing raise the dead
Gaze across the blackened yard
my mind is filled with dread
so give me all the powers of Hell
and I'll raise the dead
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The hotter the fire, the greater the lust
I hear the star of the Necromancer
my blood is black and my heart doth bleed
I am infernal and my mind's in torment
I'll raise the dead make the world unclean
Laughing as my legions rise
control the zombies mind
I hold Hell close to my breast
I'm leaving God behind
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I'll enter hellfire, I'll break the crust
Midnight
six sixty six
Torment
beastial sex
Mother
screaming in pain
Father
rules hell's domain
I don't want to be born
I don't want it
Leave me in hell
Danger
gold pentagram
Sacrifice
full blooded ram
Karma
Hell bears its child
Reaper

Evil

Master

I don't want to be born
I don't want it
Leave me in hell
Hooded figures, clouded skies
fires burn within their eyes
pentagram with baphomet midnight strikes
goat of mendez lifts his head
summons up the living dead
virgin flesh lies tied and bound
hail satanas
sacrifice
scream for mercy cry and repent Satan claims your soul
sacrifice, sacrifice, oh so nice, sacrifice
Candles glow on alters bare
a virgin's death is needed there
sacrifice to Lucifer my master
bring the calico raise the knife
welcome to my sacrifice
plunge the dagger in her breast
I insist
sacrifice
limbs weaken life flies away demons rejoice
sacrifice, sacrifice, name your price, sacrifice
Death is swift beneath Satan's sword
all the same young and old
life means nothing to my lord
drink from chalice warm and sweet
virgin's heart final beat
lightning strikes virgin dies
Satan smiles
sacrifice
the moon is black and the witches dance, heaven is denied
sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice
You think your soul is nice
you've lived in paradise
so now you take the stand
you want to hold your masters hand
you think your soul is free
look up and you'll see me
the pearly gates ablaze
the angels bear the zombies gaze
heavens on fire
and there ain't nothing you can do
heavens on fire
and when you die you'll go there too
the angel's life their death
no there ain't nothing left
the clowns of God despise
but torment renders no disguise
the skies a blazing tomb
plenty sorrow plenty doom
they hattle living sin
the souls of God can't hate to win
if God is so almighty
they why is he enslaved
in heavens hell by Satan
the universe his slave
Satan rides the skies
look up you'll see his eyes
disguised as endless stars
to keep an eye on endless wars
do you believe in God
he's chained up like a dog
and every hour he screams
Satan rules supreme
Welcoming the virgins fair, to live a noble life
In the castle known to all 
the Count's infernal wife
She invites the peasants with endless lavish foods
But, when evening spreads it wings, she rapes them of their blood
Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory
All day long the virgins sit and feast on endless meals
The Countless laughs and sips her wine 
her skin doth crack and peel
But when nighttime fills the air one must pay the price
The Countess takes her midnight bath with blood that once gave life
Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory
Living in her self styled Hell, the Countess dressed in black
Life's so distant
death's so near
no blood to fury time back
The castle walls are closing in, she's crippled now with age
Welcomes death with open arms
the reaper turns the page
Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory
The witches brew a pot of hate
with lizard, but and man
with a smile they laugh their spells
astir with wretched hand
calling demons baphomet
the tattered firyres cackle
as their mortal victims bleed
don't burn the witch
the ways of hell aren't wrong
don't burn the witch
let them brew their song
the witches of the blackened arts
are cunning, cruel and mean
persecuted by religion
God the man unseen
beastial malevolence
is chartered in their bones
leave the unreal house of God
and burn in hell at home
eye of lizard
wing of bat
testicle of man
tongue of eagle
brain of rat
Jesus Christ's left hand
the witches make the voodoo doll
a toy taboo in heaven
they dance around the pentagram
in search of rape by Satan
leave the heart and blood of men
in cauldrons laced in sin
add the arsenic, hemlock, pus
triumph takes the wings
A dark silhouette of a creature, poised, 
crouched on the corner of a cliff's edge,
waits eagerly, eyes glare patiently,
red eyes filled with fire and torment gleam  
frenzied brightness across the shadowed valleys below
A crack of thunder breaks the deafening silence which once ruled the plains.
The creature is unmoved by the commotion of the noise,
and the blinding fork of lightning which strikes only a few yards 
where it lays in wait for something
Satan laughs
Wings spread in a magnificent fullness the creature stands in full glory,
inhaling deeply, the ice cold air,
each tendon and muscle ripping in an almighty stance of the great dimensional deity
Lucifer smiles
From the far far west a chariot of fire emerges 
traveling at a tremendous speed toward the creature
The creature laughs
As if in a maddened state of mind the creature leaps up off the ridge
hovers with dignity in the now cloudless sky,
it's long red hair blowing freely in the wind.
The chariot emerges and with a sharp swift movement,
the creature takes the reins and flies off into the night,
howling out immortal cries of predication and war.
At War With Satan
Warriors gather slowly round the sacred city hell
Satan screams a vengeance on the land his angels fell
Tyrants pray disaster for the land of love and trust
Demons plot a way to turn the heaven into dust....
Satan laughs, damnation has sunk its talons deep into the womb of utopia 
spilling forth great streams of virginal purity and bliss.
Satanic majesty sits proud, 
the joyous drones of celebration enact scenes of blasphemy, lust and destruction.
Raping the holy trinity the Sabbath chimes the tunes of bless and sanity, 
the Heavens in their last throes of death.
Gabriel and his arc angels falling ever downwards 
through the fires of pandemonium to the dark deserted depths of Hell their broken bloodstained wings 
scorched the by raging inferno lay battered by the shores of the styx.
Weary from the battle they seek refuge, 
bathing their wounds in the blood of a million martyrs while celebration ringing in the heavens grows strong 
the keys to the seven gates of Hell lie momenterally unguarded.
Raging flames carved by the innocence of the angel's hearts will release forth their wealth of centuries of God 
lost souls once wronged of their destiny of Heaven's golden palace.
An unseen presence breaths never before pangs of mortal hatred and anger deep into the pounding hearts of the angels.
Once more the creature is summoned to deliver a decleration of war,
At war with Satan!
The warriors gather slowly around
The sacred city, Hell
Satan screams a vengeance
On the land as the angels fell
Tyrants pray disaster for the
Land of love and trust
Demons plot a way to turn
The Heavens into dust.
The standard bearers chosen
From the mass of Satan's dogs
To hold the flag of Hades high
Defying all the gods
Satan laughs the words of war
The Heavens shake with fear
Armageddon sings his song
The battle's ever near.
Let the joyous celebrations of Hell begin
Who holds the keys to the seven gates?
Lucifer's demonic laughter
Assist our quest, Belial prays
Free from Hell who serves the master
Sound the charge on Sabbaths day.
Charge!
Crest the demon's souls
Show yourselves in power
Angels fear resist
Nothing holds the storm
Inform the grand master of Hades
Storm the gates!
Free from the pits of Hell
Slaves emerge the mountain
We shall destroy the accursed Heavens
Advance great legions strong
Crush the gates and enter free
Our lord of Hell must take God's throne
Heavenly inferno
Spread the message far...
Take to the skies!
Come on...
Frenzied demons
Angel's cries
Lucifer commands the orgy
Molten mayhem, one thousand lies
Heaven fails to hold tranquility
The brides of sin are wed
Their price, nine holy heads
White marble walls bleed red
God's creation all must see
Heavens Hell
God has fell
Sound the knell
Where time and space collide
Mortals sit and watch the tide
Of Angels crashing up against the sacred shore
Without the holy grail
Only evil can prevail
The church of God can't hide the truth no more
Can't see the light no more
Light up the skies...
The Demons ring the Sabbath bells
Rejoice the witches chant
Prepare the sacrifice by fire
The blood runs black through heavens shell
Declare the witches dance
Nothing shall suffice
The souls of Christ
Drag him through the whores!
Orgies filled with joyous laughter
Alters of the flesh
Equinox eternal glory
Satan's empire
A new born flaming star
Children screaming out in pain
Destroy the priests
Destroy their reign
Tyrant pledge the souls of legions
Sullen and remorse
Tana turns the key of life
To hear the thunder roar
Ancients gather amidst the stars
Mortals stare in fear
The Earth is damned beneath the mist
A veil of angels tears
White clouds of life are turning black
The virgin pure she fears attack
Come on...
You are damned...
Children of pleasure move
Appear amongst us
The dark Lord has opened his jaws
Raise for Satanic queen
Ye sons and daughters
Take heed the flame forever learn
Now is come salvation
Strength and the kingdom of our
Satanic majesty
You'll always learn!
Are you damned in Hell?
Damned in Hell
Lilith holds the black heart in her hands
The blood flows
Desecration of God's holy shrine
Armageddon
Pandemonium burns in the night
The Hell spawn
Celebrations at Sabbats galore
Unite with mother whore
Take that bitch
We shall not be destroyed...
Satan laughs, damnation has sunk its talons deep into the womb of utopia 
spilling forth great streams of virginal purity and bliss.
The golden throne of the tetgrammaton is ablaze, 
Satanic majesty sits proud, 
the joyous drones of celebration enact scenes of blasphemy, lust and destruction.
Raping the holy trinity the Sabbath chimes the tunes of bless and sanity, 
the Heavens in their last throes of death.
Gabriel and his arc angels falling ever downwards through the fires of pandemonium 
to the dark deserted depths of Hell 
their broken bloodstained wings scorched the by raging inferno lay battered by the shores of the Styx.
Weary from the battle they seek refuge, 
bathing their wounds in the blood of a million matyrs while celebration ringing in the heavens grows strong 
the keys to the seven gates of Hell lie momenterally unguarded.
Raging flames carved by the innocence of the angel's hearts will release forth their wealth of centuries of God 
loving souls once wronged of their destiny of Heaven's golden palace.
An unseen presence breaths never before pangs of mortal hatred and anger deep into the pounding hearts of the angels.
Once more the creature is summoned to deliver a declaration of war.
At war with Satan!
The angels gather slowly around
The sacred city Hell
Gabriel screams a vengeance of the
Land as the angels fell
Matyrs prey disaster for the
Land of hate and scorn
The Angels curse the day the Antichrist
Was ever born...
Across infernal wastelands
Many miles of sunburnt Hell
Tribes are scattered limbs
And dust all laying as they fell
Open lies the challenge to all
Warriors now men
Let the spirits guide the winds
Until Manitou ascends
Watch the unseen burial
Eclipse the blazing skies
Feast the wings of death
With Manitou the soul shall vie
Distant beats the wardance
Echo screams out liberty
Patience stalks the crow
White man's scalp brings victory
Mighty be the powers
Of the old medicine man
Whispers of his raindance
Flow across the desert sands
Guardian of the elder spirit
Summoning the storm
Awaiting his arrival
Manitou of flesh is born
Run like Hell, in Hell
The deadly race begins
Cyanide, suicide
No prayers or foolish whims
Tonight we'll fight
With glory in our veins
Can't stop us now
Our evil always will reign
The master switch is set
And we must guard the only key
Satan's speed, our speed
Incarnate pure alive
Light up the night
Were living on a wire
We choose you loose
Nobody body catches fire
Were free you'll see
We live by our desires
Riding in the air nocturnal
Living free
Run like Hell, in Hell
The deadly race begins
Cyanide, Suicide
No prayers or foolish whims
Tonight we'll fight
With glory in our veins
Can't stop us now
Our evil always will reign
The master switch is set
And we have got the only key
Genocide
Standing in the wings
The reaper waits to play his part
Fear drains the blood
From every pure human heart
The final word is spoken
A lovers last embrace
No distance between life or death
The two are face to face
Take heed the golden dawn
Genocide
Genocide
A prayer from the sinner
For he repents for his soul
Hell becomes his destiny
For heaven is his goal
Sinner, death deceiver
Heathen, disbeliever
Genocide the cure of mankind
Armageddon patiently decides
Death unveils his gown
The place is truly on fire
You'll see no light
With genocide
Life or death it used to be
But now there is no choice
The blackened skies are filled
With cries of every nations voice
The clouds of death are forming
The judgement day is here
No mercy for the innocent
No time for even fear
The golden dawn turns black
Genocide
Genocide
No place to hide
With genocide
Placed in the wilderness, naked and cold
The night draws the warmth from my flesh
Howls in the distance
The wolves they catch my scent
They yearn for my blood warm and fresh
But I....
Cannot run, I cannot hide
I'm moments old, yet terrified
Snarling breath is on my face
I am damned in this place
Morning breaks the evening darkness
Daylight sings so loud
Father holds my in his arms
And laughs for he is proud
All is well my mother cries
A kiss for me her child
But at night my heart turns black
And calls me to the wild
In the night where the wolf-bane grows
In the night when the full moon glows
Cry wolf...
Alone in your room
By the light of the moon
Your glory is shining so bright
You prey for the day
Oh show me the way
The devil takes over tonight
It's too late, night is here
The time that you dread
The time when you loose all control
Your bodies in pain
You cry in vein
Satan takes over your soul
Even a man who's pure of heart
He says his prayers by night
Bane from a wolf when the wolf bane grows
And the moon's full and bright
I cannot resist their call
It strengthens as I age
To the pack to join the feast
And fear immortal rage
Never can I live the life
Of every normal child
Forever I must answer
To the call of the wild
The call of the wild
Stand aside, loose your pride
I'm at the gates alone
Sorcery, blasphemy
All welcome in my home
I'm leaving
But soon I'm coming back
Believe me
I'm hot on your tracks
Through the night
Eagles flight
The Angels kiss my brow
Tempting me with studded heels
The bitch is in heat now
Oh you've got me
That leather smells so sweet
I'm on fire
Breeding sin, breathing lust
Witches spell
Women Leather and Hell
Go for it
Come on turn that mother up
Dynamite, is right on time
Sends shivers down my spine
Destiny won't catch me
The choice of death is mine
Salvation is keeping out of sight
Damnation is joining in the fight
Women Leather and Hell
Satan, Father
Help me from this grave
Demons, Warriors
Ever be my slaves
because I can't reason
With men and mortal fools
They will die hard,
Hear the golden rule
Legions iron and steel
Die Hard
Men of war revealed
Die Hard
Captors of the Brave
Die Hard
Sinner, liar
Guard your crown of thorns
Priestess, Parson
Live your life of scorn
I can ride the fires
Of Hell and blasphemy
We can grow strong
Satanic royalty
Evil, angels
Vultures of the night
Ride the wings of Hades
Death is on our side
Furnace burnin' bright
because we ain't getting tired
Fight, we will fight right,
Living low in a world of our own,
Destined to live right fight,
We're taking hell as our home,
Burning lives burning,
Asking me for the mercy of god,
Ancient cries crying,
Acting fast upon the way of the dog,
Welcome to hell,
Kill we will kill death,
Masturbating on the deeds we have done,
Hell commands death kill,
Argue not of feel the death of sun,
Burning lives burning,
Asking me for the mercy of god,
Ancient cries crying,
Acting fast upon the way of the dog,
Welcome to hell,
Leave your souls at his feet,
Kiss the flames
Scorn defeat
Die we won't die live,
Our choice of difference is what you'll never know,
Mortal voids live die,
Buried deep beneath the fall of the snow,
Burning lives burning,
Asking me for the mercy of god,
Ancient cries crying,
Acting fast upon the way of the dog,
Welcome to hell,
In the name of Satan
We'll achieve our goal
With the blessings of Hades
We'll outlive our role
Through the power of Hellfire
We will gather our strength
With the blood of mere mortals
Our thirst will be quenched
In the name of Satan
Great things can be done
Through the lore of the demons
Satan's song can be sung
Gather around my Legions
For in time you'll see
Mortals screaming for mercy
At the king for world war three
In the name of Satan
We'll take what we need
Rock and roll damnation
Let your heart bleed
Sensing the disaster
So we'll blame our hate
Hell bore Satan's child
To use you as our bait
Hear infernal legions plead
As Satan sings his songs of war
As I see mortal corpses rise
Up from the depths
I care not for the whore
I shall destroy the priests
Bound in chains and damned in Hell
I shall never release their souls
For the internal torment always reigns
Summon legions of the night
For we are now as one
Warhead
hear the thunder roar
Warhead 
unite the lightning whore
Power burning 
Hell and man
Raging torment
Take my hand
Frenzied motions
Reach your soul
Dance the warhead
Fast of slow
Born of thunder
Raised by fire
Call the heavens
By desire
Screaming furnace
Death of life
Demons calling
Chosen wives
Sabbats charming
Out in lust
Chance the warhead
Win or bust
Warhead
hear the thunder roar
Warhead
unite the lightning whore
Warhead
engraved on flesh & bone
Warhead
born of mortal stone
Sorceress of old love potions
Brew an orgy strong
Priestess of the highest order
Light the fires of song
Chime the bell
Raising hell
Nothing can go wrong
Transcend in motion make
The wheels of life revolve
Wicked witch of yesterlands
Bring your spirit here
Tell us of your day of judgement
Reinact your fear
Dance in the flame
Nude without shame
For all to see
I'll take a trip with you
To make your innocence clear
Whore of leisure whore of sin
Name your hourly price
Take me home and give me pleasure
Treat me oh so nice
Legs open wide
Take me inside
I won't throw your dice
I wanna taste the caves of flesh
Within your face
In a dream or a nightmare
When love gives way to hate
The quest begins
For the keys to the seven gates
Ride the wings of a locust
See the wizard cast his spell
Search for the keys to
The seven gates of Hell
In Heavens Hell
Where all evil dwells
And man and beast are one
Conceiled to all
Revealed to none
Lie those infernal gates
Those damned infernal gates
The seven gates of Hell
Hear the cry of the zombie
Raid the body of its soul
The quest for the sacred keys
Has become its goal
Steal the wings of a hydra
Take the sword from the sacred shrine
The strength of the beast
Take the sinners mind
Unveiled in death to the sinner
Written in the ancient book of lies
Hear the demons call
From the crimson waterfall
As the blood rains from the skies
When realities a dream
And every lie is true
In the day when you are me
And the night when I am you
When the flame of life grows cold
We chime the silent bell
And the unborn child is old
The seven gates of Hell
Going through the gates of Hell!
Oh, in Heavens Hell
So many died in vein
They never lived, their tales to tell
None shall find the keys
To set their spirits free
From the seven gates of Hell
The seven gates
The seven gates
The seven gates of Hell
Hotter than an atom bomb
Holocaust so vast
While devastation is our homeland
Light ain't all that fast
Vesuvius erupts our tune
Igniting all in reach
Leaving all in purgatory
Until time decides to teach
Power Drive
Wilder than a charging beast
Our methods set on death
Elements recharge our songs
No time to catch your breath
The Richter scale determines
If our instruments in tune
Candle light the new volcano
Power shines the moon
Laser lights the soul until
The final curtain drops
Power Drive
Corpses guard there dynasty
But power never dies
See our raging bolts of hell
And mayhem in your eyes
Exorcet the boiling oil
The volume never stops
Laser lights the soul until
The final curtains dropped
Leaving all in purgatory
Until time decides to teach
Power Drive
Venus sheds her skin of gold
Sacrifice her life
Washes out the demon sleep
That hides between her eyes
Walking, watching, wandering out
Of soul she must pursue in death
Will she reach you?
Flytrap
Venus takes the lightning
And her hair becomes a flame
With a guise of innocents
Who learn her unknown game
Dancing, raining, sorcery
He's caught between her heat all year
She's pleased to meet you
demon child
virgins wild
angels death
there's nothing left
Born without mortal care
Joyous of flight
Pleasing to the eye
Deadly delight
Venus arguementor
Torturing my aged soul
Fighting through the ashes
Give me back my skin of gold
Walking, watching, wondering
The soul she has pursued in life
Will she teach you?
Flytrap
I preach the ways of Satan
Answer to his calls
I translate manuscripts
On ancient Latin scrolls
In my shrine, my avernus
I see the gates of Hell
Guarded well by Chronozon
Tortured souls do dwell
I mount the virgin Venus
Plague the blackened seas
I am the souls destructor
Marching without fear
The night is filled with souls
In coral ecstasy
The saraband of death
Will always follow me
I bear the evil eye
Possess the unbidden
I'll bring your dead alive
And chew your flesh from bone
I stalk through life and death
With Gorgon for my gaze
I breath the immortal pain
Beware the human race
Light the fires now
If you want some action
Don't you take a seat
In the darkness we're gonna
Knock you off your feet
Dancing with the devil
Feel the scorching heat
Evacuate the dance floor
We're making hell tonight
We ain't talking bullshit
We ain't fucking around
We're gonna burn this place to the ground
We're not here to entertain you
We're gonna make you scream
When you wake in Hell tonight
You'll think it was a dream
Feel the razor fangs of fire
You'll wish you weren't born
Cry the cries of every man
Are you getting warm?
We ain't talking bullshit
We ain't fucking around
We're gonna burn this place to the ground
Hells the only answer
When rock and roll gets tough
We ain't yet packing up yet
No we ain't had enough
If you'd like to gamble
Get up here with me
Taste the fiery flames of death
Not immortality
We not talking fucking bullshit
We're gonna burn this place to the ground
To the ground
Burn this place to the ground
We're gonna burn this place to the ground
Harmony dies
Demons calling to Hell
Wise ways ye cannot sell
Praying fools light their ways
Night descends shrouds the day
Unveil the hysterskies
Immortal children cry
Question of when and why
Harmony dies
Sacrifice the solstice
Casting out the priestess
Anger lingers in death
Waiting the for the last breath
Hell has no disguise
Just look through Satan's eyes
When dogs of war can fly
Harmony dies
Death is fighting with death
Time shall feed on what's left
Prophets on the altar
Voicing his words of war
Walk through their sacred fires
The halls of souls admire
But as the end grows nigh
Harmony dies
Look at my eyes and you will see
Fire is burning inside of me
Fire it burns
Fire it burns
Look at the children
Look at my eyes
Look at me Satan's child
Born of evil thus defiled
Brought to life through Satanic birth
Raised in Hell to live on Earth
Come look at me and I'll show you
Things that will open your eyes
Come listen to me and I'll tell you
Things that will sicken your mind
We drink the vomit of the priests
Make love with the dying whore
We suck the blood of the beast
And hold the key to deaths door
Through many a tormented night prevail
Thy excorsions can but fail
Though crucifix doth burn my flesh
I shall not yield to you unless I die!
I am possessed by all that is evil
The death of your God I demand!
I spit at the virgin you worship
And sit at my lord Satan's left hand
I care not for the priests who are crying
I answer to Baphomet's call
A cry for help from the dying
Means nothing to me at all
I am decreed by lord Satan's fine evil
To destroy what all mortals love most
Satan is my master incarnate
Hail praise to my unholy host
Look at my eyes!
Hellchild
Demon of delights you won't fight
Hellchild
Tonight's the night tonight
I walk the streets of darkness
Indulgence in the air
To late to save the few
Who knew of what and were
But as I near the answer
Grows into a lore
Satan's commandments
From the pits of hellfire roar
Hellchild
The midnight oil is gathered
Scents of lust ignite the air
Bodies naked golden writhe
Their beauty without care
Babylon their peasants dream
My talisman drink the blood elixir
In pyramid demand
We have told you once before
Now you listen and take heed
You are a servant
To the dark immortal breed
Hellchild
I walk the streets of darkness
Compulsion sings despair
The beast dictates the words
For every soul to wear
Black mist Mendes whispers
Locked behind the door
Take the keys to Egypt
And sing your evil score
Hellchild
Moonshine
Taste her feel her
Rising the west
Hear the slack tormentor
She's the best
Warm me cool me
You can take me day or night
Be my inventor
I won't fight
Moonshine
Forever I'm enchained
Moonshine
I can't think but crave
Buy her, breed her
Seeping though your skin
Don't call no doctor
She'll always win
Anxious women
Staring at your soul
She saw you coming
Young or old
Moonshine
She commands the waves
Moonshine
Forever I'm her slave
Bleed her, breed her
She's yours to take
Cross the palm with silver
She'll awake
Fire, water
Goddess of men
Take a drink of thunder
And she'll say when
Moonshine
Forever I'm enchained
Moonshine
Forever I'm her slave
Gather round oh young ones
Listen to the night
Loud as Hell and black as death
Only men take fright
Sit around my flame bright
Warm your bones and hear
Virgins die and demons cry
Throw away your fears
Suffer not the children
Sleep tight our fathers
Guard our mothers well
Vampires and werewolves
Erupt your dreams our spell
The evening sabbath song
A longing to be free
Lost children wander waiting
Barefoot in the sea
Suffer not the children
Suffer not the children
Or be deemed a damned disgrace
Blessed be the wench
To which delivers in his grace
Gather around my young ones
We can go away
I'll guide you in the night
Follow me
Tonight we'll find a path
The Hell-born sinners trail
Beware! None shall stop us
Innocence guards our way
The amulets of kings
Our voodoo games
We know but never tell
Of our infernal names
Suffer not the children
Mystique our majesty, goddess unwind
Mystique of mind reveal, mystique of mind
Mystique our majesty, goddess unwind
Mystique my reveal
Match the eyes of the dragon
Catch the flames of breath
Hypnotize reality
And join in with the rest
Chase the hunted magic
And pray to its commands
You think you winning flight control
Bite the heart of the arrow
Forget the purpose life
Breaking in vein
Injecting the knife
Eagle eyes the challenge
Regurgitating feast
Yourself alive in mind
And shell joins the deceased
You can take all
Reach your hand right out and sin
Don't mistake it
Kick the womb of the serpent
Announce the arctic foul
No mans dog but when he's gone you feel him growl
Heat the the bowl of the chalice
Release the virgins soul
Every scent of innocence forever growing old
Who awaits all
Crawls through the pores of your skin
Don't debate it
Mystique to those unknown
While all the mists arise
Death deals in danger
Take a look at your surprise
Mystique our majesty collected in my mind
Hell bent for mystery
Goddess reveal unwind
When the snow turns black
I'll be back
I'll be here
Between the blinking of an eye
When the screams attack
Welcome back
Before the newborn starts to cry
And it's all in the eyes of a child
Flaming star or the call of the wild
Devils Eve
The whispers in the breeze
Devil's wine
The river bleeds in time
Where the red clouds chase
That's the place in a dream
Across the suns hot blazing sky
Where he hides his face
In disgrace for his queen
He must choose the way she dies
And they say when his eyes turn to green
He'll awake living sin never seen
Watches over you
That's the clue to believe
An instant and you're hypnotised
Watch his eyes look through
False or true to deceive
You take his place you're crucified
Devils Eve
The whispers in the breeze
Devil's wine
The river bleeds in time
Devil's wine
Watch out
There's a cry from Atlantis
Takes the wind by surprise
Voices so demanding
Thunder swarms the skies
To the north of horizon
Over mountains at east
There's a call to the lost ones
From the elders deceased
We're chanting
They're chanting
It's in a tear
Outside a prayer
Without form it's haunting the air
It's in a kiss
within a bite
It brings the darkness into light
The chanting of the priests
The chanting of the priests
Watch out
It's a song for Olympus
Cracks the morpheus dream
It oozes the ozone
Heavenly screaems
By the golden waterfall
Through the fog on the ice
There's a voice in the shell call
It's demanding precise
We're chanting
They're chanting
The chanting of the priests
Yells ascend into the sleeping
Screech the hawk relpies
Shudders pound the marching hearts
In reborn synchronize
Held in force the feeding prism
Catalogues the souls inside
The city in the sea
Watch Out
Where there's life without presence
There's a voice without sound
Deep inside you can't feel it
Yet it's all around
Through the eye of the pharoah
To the tombs in the sand
There's a force in the distance
Calls you to the sacred land
The chanting of the priests
You know she only plays beneath the night of day
Weaving her deadly web of lies to tempt her pray
Her deadly poison rots the reason in your mind
You contribute towards the future of her kind
Oh no
Don't you believe her
Look out
She is the fire
Heavenly hell
You can't resist 
Under her spell
So inviting
The angels fell
She lets you in
Under her spell
But you can't see behind the schemes
You thought you'd fell into a dream
You should have taken more care
Can't you see your dreams
They're a nightmare
The angels fell
Heavenly hell
Under a spell
Caught
Under a spell
Under a spell
You know she's dangerous between her smiles and grace
Her charms adventurous with schizophrenic lies
And then her final trick the noose that she has tied
Oh no
Don't you believe her 
Look out
She is the fire
Heavenly hell
You can't resist
Under her spell
So inviting
The angels fell
She lets you in
Under her spell
The angels fell
Heavenly hell
Under a spell
Caught
Under a spell
Under a spell
You're caught
I can smell the fear
Hear the screams of pain
I must kill or be meat
I'll say to you
On this planet of dirt
Number one comes first
This is our place
The last of the human race
Children of disgrace
Now can you all hear me say
There's a calm before the storm
Don't say that you ain't been warned
A calm before the storm
And it's coming for you
Is there life after death
Do you ask yourself
This is our place
The last of the human race
Children of disgrace
Now can you all hear me say
There's a calm before the storm
Don't say that you ain't been warned
A calm before the storm
And it's coming for you
I have smelled the fear
Heard the screams of pain
This is our place
The last of the human race
Children of disgrace
Now can you all hear me say
There's a calm before the storm
Don't say that you ain't been warned
A calm before the storm
And it's coming for you
There's a calm before the storm
Take my hand and we'll be one
It's a chance in a million
Don't be scared on our way down
You'll belong to the hellion
Black your tears dry on me
Friend or foe or liar
Fire
In hell fire
Fire
Hear my tale and walk with me
Answer not to oblivion
Ask your stars your destiny
Shining down on Marillion
Red your eyes look for me
Scream the demon's choir
Search your soul for we're the same
Don't believe you're a warrior
Let me kick your mind insane
Hell's my unholy abattoir
Give your services to me
Burning feeds my buyers
Fire
Fire
Burning in fire
Fire
Hell fire
You want to be the master blaster
Killing yourself to win
You let your body sweat burn faster
Moulding a god of sin
You've got the madness and the glory
And now your heart's pounding blood
You're living your own story
You know it does you good
You put yourself through hours of torture
Increasing mindless pain
You soon become a demon vulture
You're getting greedy for gain
You've got the madness and the glory
Killing yourself to win
You're always living your own story
Moulding a god of sin
You want to be the master blaster
And now your heart's pounding blood
You let your body sweat burn faster
You know it does you good
He watches witches weaving wonders
Inside their crystal balls of thunder
Seeing the future past and present
Of messages the universe sends
They summon through the sphere
A child so fair so virgin pure
They summon me my slave
Bring her to their lure
The beauty and the beast
The beauty and the beast
She calls christ in churches crimson
But I can see the blood on your sins
I've got to take her
Leave her
Take her
Tell me the price if I deliver
They guide me through the lake
By one a slave of flesh
They summon his return
In vain wasting their breath
The beauty and the beast
The beauty and the beast
They cast countless conjurations
He didn't sign the pact the fact is
Their screams of failure fade to whispers
Trying to heal their mental blisters
They summon through the sphere
A child so fair so golden pure
They didn't realise
This was the demon's cure
The beauty and the beast
The beauty and the beast
I lust a princess
A crystal queen
Virginal whiteness is all that I dream
To make a contact
I'm dying to feel
My magic snow
Show me your real
Watch out
You there
She makes you feel good
Don't you care
Inside
Can't fight it
You bring your money and be there
For the deadline now
It's a deadline now
For the midnight frost
It's a deadline now
It's a deadline
Give me an angel
Blow me a breeze
You walk on silver
Travel the seas
Hunting a killer
It's a jungle disease
Watching in marvel you'll steal her release
Watch out
You there
She makes you feel good
Don't you care
Inside
Can't fight it
You bring your money and be there
For the deadline now
It's a deadline now
For the midnight frost
It's a deadline now
It's a deadline now
My mind's in torment
Something's not clear
I take my godess where nobody hears
She sees right through me
She's in my mind
Mother of madness
Immortals blind
Watch out
You there
She makes you feel good
Don't you care
Inside
Can't fight it
You bring your money and be there
For the deadline now
It's a deadline now
For the midnight frost
It's a deadline now
Gypsy woman calls me
Caution leads the way
Reads from a book of night and day
Words or endless stories
Crystals in her gaze
Shows me of a place inside a maze
Cities golden splendor
Only life surrender
Candles all around me
Mountains in the sky
This is the place where life's a lie
Wakes in mortuary
Gasping in the air
Wind breathes words
She's not there
Deserts vast and barren
Still the witches jargon
Promises of splendor
Just my life surrender
She's a gypsy
Blinding lights flash at me
Wake me from this dream
I can't believe this place is real
Fires in stormy weather
Silver shields the rain
Her grip so tight that my life drains
Nectar from the serpent
Poison messages sent
Psylocybin splendor
Never life surrender
She's a gypsy
Prime, the first evolutionary plan, 
that spawned the first ever Superstition of man,
God created every atom that lives, 
but was he really there at all?
Evil,in every satanic scroll,
In different forms to every race and blacker than coal,
He doth destroy every atom that lives but is he really there at all?
The Holy scribes fortold the destiny of man,
Living coldly on the earth, disrupting ancient plans.
Well is this what we are and what we have become,
Or is the only tie, the way we die and how we had begun?
Prime Evil, 
an evolutionary call,
Prime Evil, 
quenched in the fires of their souls,
Prime Evil, 
you'll never see the sun again!
Danger,
that's the human call,
Growing strong and aging wise, 
the race can only fall,
Well is this Holy anger, 
bleached upon our souls,
Is this the Evil One, 
satan's son, gabriel's foe?
Prime Evil,
an evolutionary call,
Prime Evil,
quenched in the fires of their souls,
Prime Evil,
you'll never see the sun again!
Prime Evil,
an evolutionary call,
Prime Evil,
quenched in the fires of their souls,
Prime Evil,
you'll never see the sun again!
Prime Evil,
Quenched in the fires of their souls.
Prime Evil,
You'll never see the sun again!
Prime Evil.
There was a time when hunger was mine,
you'd walk the line.
You sowed the seed, 
you're making us need,
you're watching us bleed,
you bastard!
We always felt you were a better friend,
with your riches and your smiles,
You helped me keep the wolves from the door,
You filled our heads so full of Lies!
We always felt you were a better friend,
with your iches and your smiles,
You helped to keep the wolves from the door,
You filled our heads so full of Lies!
Parasite!
Life was a ball and you took it all,
We took a fall,
You were the doubt
You won't bail us out,
there's no use to shout,
You're dying!
We always felt you were a better friend,
with your riches and your smiles,
You helped to keep the wolves from the door,
You filled our heads so full of Lies!
We always felt you were a better friend,
with your riches and your smiles,
You helped to keep the wolves from the door,
You filled our heads so full of Lies!
Lord of Ancients,
Son of God.
Buried in this Holy Ground.
They pray on heaven and on fire,
deliver them from evil,
Death.
Their keys that keep their secret safe, 
are lost in war and now, 
they pay the price!
They cannot be freed!
They cry but there's no other way to free them.
Blackened are the Priests,
of evil,
drinking from their chalaces of blood,
redeem them,
Blackened are the Priests.
Amist the holy cries of heaven,
beneath the soddened earth,
hell.
The whitened collars of the dogs, 
that spew forth hardy thoughts of life,
Ah help them!
Blackened is the mantle of the Priests.
Amen!
Blackened is the collar of the Priests.
Blackened is the collar of the Priests.
The Holy alter now of heaven,
cannot deliver us from pain.
God help them!
The holy alter now of heaven,
doth not deliver them from pain.
They cannot turn their back on hell,
from the grace they fell,
all their futile efforts wane.
They cannot be freed!
They cry but there's no other way, to free them.
Blackened are the Priests,
of evil,
drinking from their chalaces of blood,
redeem them.
Blackened are the Priests,
of evil,we try but there's no other way to free them,
Blackened are the Priests,
of evil,drinking from their chalaces of blood,
redeem them,
Blackened are the Priests!
Laughing and screaming and bathing in blood.
Ripping at throats of the damned.
Lucifer's calling awakens his dogs,
Thrust from Lord Satan's left hand!
Carving our Satanic truss.
Dipped in the pure virgin soul,
feeding on us!
CARNIVEROUS!
Centuries measured by offerings made,
and openings made in the soul.
Steel razored teeth,ripping the flesh,
feeding the ultimate goal.
And making our sacrifice
hoping the lord is appeased?
and draining the life.
CARNIVEROUS!
Screaming and crying ,awakens the beast,
rising him from his dark lair.
Pulling and tearing and ripping the flesh,
Attaining the pure virgin fair.
And carving our satanic truss.
Dipped in the pure virgins soul.
CARNIVEROUS!
Transparently Obvious, tactless and trite!
You give up on life mate, you're not worth the fight!
We're looking right through you to see to the soul,
but sadly in your case your only a hole!
Skeletal Dance
Living your life by the end of a string,
You have to admit, it's not a great thing!
Except when he grins you'll see
Skeletal Dance
Now Mickey's a Mouse so his young brother says,
The best crimes are cowardly,
crime never pays.
Violence,
Destruction and Killing's the shout,
But where does he hide when the cat is about?
Skeletal Dance
Well I feel something's taking me,
I don't know where?
It's like a trip inside a seperate mind!
The ghost of tomorrow of my favorite dream,
Is telling me to leave it all behind!
Feel it slipping away,
Slipping in tomorrow.
Gotta get to happiness,
From the depths of sorrow.
I'm alright,
am I right?
As I try to get away from you now!
Am I right?
I'm alright,
As I try to get away from you now!
Sting Me!
Well I feel something's giving me the chance to return,
It's giving me the chance of saving my soul.
A big bad demigod,
fading away,
I'm going back to where I'm in control!
Feel it slipping away,
Slipping in tomorrow.
Getting back to Sanity,
From the depths of sorrow.
Was it wise,to disguise,
As I try to get away from you now?
Is there a way,
I can pay,
Or is it true I have to stay with you now?
Was I right,
Am I right,
As I try to get away from you now?
Was it wise,
to disguise,
As I try to get away from you now?
I'm the King of schizophrenia,
the pest of the Earth,
I singed my soul in the fires of Hell!
I feel someone eluding me,
But now it's all mine!
I set the trap and it was me who fell!
Feel it slipping away,
Slipping in tomorrow.
getting back to sanity,
From the depths of sorrow.
No more lies,
I got wise,
I despise the way I worship you
Now your free,
can't you see?
this time I won't be led by you
Trapped inside Mazonic minds that simple thought denied,
No escape,
no orifice,
they're only drained through their eyes!
The mindless thoughts and afterglow,
the scars that's left behind,
Drilled upon the cranium and sculpted deep in the mind!
How they writhe in pain,
padded room of doom,
INSANE!
Pulling at the iron bars and tearing at the walls,
Screaming with Insanity but no-one hears the calls!
You know in truth your mind is clear but no-one's here to tell,
A frienzied madness echo's out inside your own brain-cell!
How they writhe in pain,
Padded room of doom!
How they writhe in pain,
INSANE!
A Venomous completion now is riddled through you veins,
Staring at the button padded walls,
INSANE!
Nothing left inside your head and empty, useless, tomb,
Here you live,
alive, undead,
inside your pillowed room!
How they writhe in pain,
Padded room of doom,
INSANE!
Sleepless nights,
drenched in sweat.
A lust for life,
endless death.
We're dancing in the fire,
We're lost in the Flame.
We're lost in the Fire,
Nothing stays the same!
INTO THE FIRE!
INTO THE FIRE!
Day to night,
night to day,
Lost in dreams,
that fade away!
Into the fire,
We're dancing in the flame!
We're lost in the fire,
Well nothing stays the same!
INTO THE FIRE!
INTO THE FIRE!
In the night,
alone and dark,
deep within the source,
Tourtured feel the flames of Hell, 
rising to the cause!
All my life,
drenched in pain!
All my needs,
all the same.
We're dancing in the fire,
We're lost in the falme.
Dancing in the fire,
Well nothing stays the same!
Memories fresh within my head
blood is fresh but you are dead
Cross into the freaks domain
See your fear feel your pain
The prophesy has now begun
You cannot hide you cannot run
Leave you bleeding at my feet
You are natural you are meat
Tribes
Below the graves
Breed
Refuge by day
Tribes
their home beneath
Breed
Alive but deceased
Blessed with the gift of flight
Changing shape and unseen sight
Knowing why and knowing when
Gifted with the dreams of men
Out of sight out of mind
Leave our world you're not of our kind
What he fears he can't enjoy
What man envies he destroys
Leave the garden of your torment
Through the gates that hold your fear
Monsters freaks the cursed the gifted
Day is gone the night is here
Death by fire death by gun
Death by knife death by sun
Born apart they crave the same
Living in their unreal pain
Prejudice deeper than creed
The reason for this hate is breed
Not unholy but alone
Just for this we burn their home
Banished from the world of men
Man beware they'll rise again
Led by a sacred feeling in my heart
I have left my evil ways to restart
Now I heard Eden call
I must try not to fall
All is good in heaven
But I want more
Am I stripped of evilness to the core
Now I hear the darkness say
Rise my son and do your work
Make them pay!
Even in heaven there's hell
Even in heaven
Brought by the holy son
Welcomed and blessed inside
Now that the dead's begun
When the war is over
as it's just begun
Wehn your god has fallen
And Satan's work is done
I will sit at
his strong left side
with my head held high
and a wreath of pride
Here we stand as the forces blow
Across the land
Open minds and now open sores
But no open hand
Hiding in our trench of steel
To witness the blast
Nothing to say and now nothing to feel
Now it's hopeless and past
The wind that was meant to be
Oppenheimer built radioactivity
Buildings and houses crops and forethought
Have now gone to ground
All but the dust and the helpless debris
Are all that are found
Now his creation is purchased by gods
Who must reconvene
Deciding to cleanse the Earth of its life
By priming their own warmachine
Skil will grow soft blood will grow cold
But not on your frame
He mastered the deadliest weapon of all
But was he insane
He built it for life
He built it for peace
Oh that's what he thought
But evilness knows no boundaries
And satan will read from his court
He was in life as he was in death
A well remebered man
His life was taken like a sudden breath
that simply wasn't planned
And all that's left to say
Written on his grave it says:
In Memory Of
In all the essence of a friendship he,
was never so cold or sad
He tried so hard as he struggled in
What little time he had
No more return to home
Written on his stone it says
In Memory Of
And now he's gone all that's left behind
Is a legacy
In the pages of a magazine
Left in time to read
the only thing that's said
A memory of his life
Written at it's head it says
All this left behind
Gahter round and listen to
the tales I have to tell
Of demons, death and misery
In this wonderland called hell
The things that children dream of
Are present in this land
Look in my eyes and trust me
Come take my hand
The looking glass doth break
Revealing all inside
A land of joy and misery
No place for you to hide
We are your darkest fears
Faerie tale, nightmare fantasy
Keeper or souls, stealer or breath
the legions. 
Revel in ecstacy
The nightmares that awake you
Believe that they are real
The demons laugh and feast upon
The children's hearts they steal
Tempted into darkness
By those who would be true
Lured and deceived
by the evil that we do
Sugar and spice
and everything nice
fortune favours the chosen few
Laughter and tears
Heartache and tears
Emotional torture inside of you
Sing a song of sixpence
Mummy's going to die
Daddy is the devil
And baby's going to cry
Yu're safe with me
you wait with bated breath
the pied piper plays his song
Come follow to your death
My brain fed with ecstacy
Fills my need
As I feel my body burst with great speed
And I clench a needle in a blood drained fist
Then I turn and mark another trip off my list
Feel that rush, 
with that gold satanic dust
feel that pain,
 the drug induce through my veins
I will in life as I will in death
Sow the seeds with every breath
Never will I run, never will I hide
Only to express myself and feel it deep inside
Acid
Now I dream in comatose neuotic state
As my paranoia grows I must wait
Til the feeling of the drug starts to die
Then I'll hit the drug again, take me high
Feel that buzz, 
for all the goddam good it does
Feel the flight, 
that flies me in through day and night
Now inside my arteries there's no blood
The thouht of you has plagued my years
I see you now
Crawling all over me
Symptom of my darkest fears
With me now
Living inside of me
In the night
As you sleep
the web begins to form
Across your face to suffocate
And kill before the dawn
Arachnid
Strangely drawn towards her lair certain death,
she wants to be part of you
Lie in wait my choice of mate
I can't resist she
Bites and devours you
Lift your body
From the ground
Strech octapoidal limbs
Leave the web
Without a sound
The fantasy begins
Come into the parlour said the spider to the fly
Not really knowing that the end is drawing nigh
Making love in ecstacy, 
the venom she injects
Death is swift, 
limbs entwined amid arachnid sex
The scent you spread I know so well
could leave me dead
Hopelessly mesmerised
Your bite will mean the end to me
Can you see I'm
Helplessly hypnotised
Panic stricken
Terrified
Cocooned within the web
Arachnophobic
Misery
Release me from this living nightmare
If I stalk you must forgive me
For this dance is my chemistry
Questioning the future with flaming intent
I kneel before the temples of ice
Crystalised walls rise to 10,000 feet
Behind lies th answers to life
My cold breathless pain, makes me hunger for fire
Must forge on, must remain and fulfil my desire
Inside temples of
Running the tunnels, the icy walls scaled
I strech for the welfare of heat
Staring through clouds of my own fog-soaked breath
The challenge that I must defeat
My heart sinks in fear, as I seek but can't tell
I feel death drawing near, as I reach into hell
Here, in temples of ice
Here now, in my mind's esy
Lost my sight, my soul I find decaying into dust
Come on turn it up!
Madness
Stalking the night
Feeding fast on my prey
Draining the life
untill the dawn of the day
Drinking and sucking
The blood rushing sweet
Half crazed with glory
Half crazed in the heat
Bloodlust
Tearing the flesh
Of the weak and the child
Sparing no one
The meek and the mild
I sink my fangs in your
Neck as you dream
I am Count Cronos
Vampire Supreme
Bloodlust
Bloodlust upon me
I'm biting the flesh
I'll take away
Your God given breath
Now I shall feast
On your life giving blood
Leave you to die
On the land you once stood
Bloodlust
In the name of Satan
We'll achieve our goal
With the blessings of Hades
We'll outlive our role
Through the power of Hellfire
We will gather our strength
With the blood of mere mortals
Our thirst will be quenched
In the name of Satan
Great things can be done
Through the lore of the demons
Satan's song can be sung
Gather around my Legions
For in time you'll see
Mortals screaming for mercy
At the king for world war three
Hail Satanas
In the name of Satan
We'll take what we need
Rock and roll damnation
Let your heart bleed
Sensing the disaster
So we'll blame our hate
Hell bore Satan's child
To use you as our bait
Hear infernal legions plead
As Satan sings his songs of war
As I see mortal corpses rise
Up from the depths
I care not for the whore
I shall destroy the priests
Bound in chains and damned in Hell
I shall never release their souls
For the internal torment always reigns
Summon legions of the night
For we are now as one....
I am the evil one
The tempeter sinner man
Hail leviathan
Omnipotence lucifer
Asmodeus my soul
Feeding off inhuman life
Blood of liquid gold
Evil One
Flesh and bone
Evil One
Set in stone
I the royal prince of hell
Command infernal names
Lightning fills my ancient bones
Chthulu rise in flames
Dominating centuies

Rejoice

Behold evil rules
Ever pregnant mysteries
Ahmoon commands the birth
Howling incantations
I rise from blackened earth
Evil One
Flesh and bone
Evil One
Carved in stone
Raised in hell's infernal flame
raised to rule on earth
Crucify the martyrs soul
To give the infant birth
Hearts of titans powerful
Fighting the good fight
Lillith puts him to her breast
And holds him in delight
Raised in hell
raised in hell
Raised in hell by sorcery
Raised with pride of sin
Legions roar as churches fall
My reign can now begin
Souls of saturn enter me
The battle has begun
Belphegor brings mars and war
To please his masters son
Raised in hell
raised in hell
Raised in hell's black magic
Raised of demon seed
Dying at the witching hour
A virgins soul for me
Minds of Magic conjugate
The spells of potions purge
Hold the black horse ready
For the lord of this world
Raised in hell
raised in hell
All devils eve the witches exchange energy
Black warlocks concentrate predicting prophecies
Announcing serenade uniting under stars
The celebration desecration from afar
Secret evening thunder
Pagans dancing under
Pale moon rising watching
Starlight gazes catching
All devils eve
All devils eve the candle red alights the Queen
The black familiars in pentacles of green
Flowing the bloodline past millenia so strong
Reciting atmospheres to tangle mortal song
Secret evening thunder
Pagans dancing under
Pale moon rising watching
Starlight gazes catching
All devils eve
All devils eve electric orgy spells are cast
magnetic impulses circles painted last
The psyhic inspiration rings the pewter bell
The bond exists in consciousness invisible
Secret evening thunder
Pagans dancing under
Pale moon rising watching
Starlight gazes catching
All devils eve

I write these words as witness to the crime
You throw them back and say the crime is mine
I balance life and death now you deny
I read these words aloud and watch you die
I sit and watch you die
Your flesh will feed my land,
one day you'll understand
I breed thee
I feed thee
I feed thee, you bite the
hand that feeds thee
Protect me
reject me, spat me out and reserect thee
Belie me
deny me, then rape and crucify thee
Destroyed and damned
Your soul as mist and dust, old bones powdered and crushed
You gut me
and fuck me, you burn and you insult thee
Pollute me
uproot me, the treason absoluetly
Deface me
embrace me, you strangle then erase thee
Destroyed and damned
If you know not what you do
if you gamble
will you lose If you're guilty of the crime
do you live or do you die
I sit and watch you die
The sands of time will fade can't stop the life decay
I raise thee
disgrace me, insanity replace thee
Impale me
inhale me, your lungs begin to fail thee
You eat me
deplete me, an endless overloading
Destroyed and damned
Feel the dirt beneath my fingers
Taste the soil inside my mouth
Muscles screaming 
soundless cries
Silent staring of a thousand eyes
Blood is pumping through my veins
Tendond tearing while fragile life remains
Ears are bursting sight filled with dust
Cry out in pain 
when will this end
Choking nightmares
Bleeding eyes
Holloow voices
Silent cries
Blood is pumping, 
sight unseen
Silent prayer from lifeless lips
My ears are bursting, 
a mother's cry
Blood that from a still heart drips
Where I wander
do you follow
If you cut me
do I bleed
Do we die with each single exhalation
Born again with newly savoured breath
Choking nightmares
Bleeding eyes
Holloow voices
Silent cries
Choking nightmares
Bleeding eyes
Holloow voices
Silent cries
Fighting and biting white thunder and lightning
Chasing the locust on its trail
Movements of majyk, 
false moves become tragic
According to winds how we sail
Flight of the hydra
Snare of the pharaoh remember now they know
Or knew of the universe vast
Sign of the symbol finds passageway's nimble
Revealing the old satanas
Flight of the hydra
Flight of the night
flight of the soul
Flight of your life
spirit of gold
Searching and searing sarcastically feeding
Deceiving the truth from the next
Enchantment embrases the snake as it ages
Awaiting the life that is next
Flight of the hydra
Denied the everlastin life
behold the son of man
Nevermore the saviour
bound and damned

The lies of ages
love you to death
Inhale your last breath

Everlasting lies
Richteous path lies
False prophet lies
Rejected from the minds

Thou shalt not ask
Thou shalt not rule
One law for on
What thou will do

lead me in to hell
God's forsaken
Hear me mortals
Or I'll condem you to that shit and puke
You were destined to lounge in
You'll work the blood fields
Sail the semen seas
Feelings of pain and fear
Mortal man

See me mortals
In nightmares eat your mind
Amongst endless screaming drones
Regurgitating bones to plant
And water with your tears
Mortal man
animal
prepare to feel hot
Fear me mortals
Or your mind and guts will explode
In your very own sickly self
You'll haunt the realms of purgatory
Dying off pain and fear

Carnal insticts unwind

Feel the rush as you sire

You never know when it will come
Just like a bullet from a gun
You lie awake 
you sweat and shake
may no lord have mercy on your soul
Take him down
Vengeance will be mine
And as you sow shall you reap
You pray to lords your soul to keep
You have a lie
You hang your head in shame and you ask
Why!
why!
Vengeance

Vengeance will be mine
You tell the world that black is white
No backing down your always right
your full of shit
Why don't you just lie down & die
Fuck you
Vengeance will be mine
Vengeance is mine
Set alight in purgatory
Tormented moans of pain
Piercing dark analogies
Spat out in full disdain
War against christ
Diabolus awaits you
Tearing the flesh from bone
Slicing edge of sharpened steel
Terror to call your own
War against christ
Earth cracks asunder
Sharpens the bass to point
Echoes summoning 
To agony anoint
War against christ
Arise young souls alight
Reclaim your satanic rights

The past all there is fear
Atomic atmospheres
Crumble in ice faces

Pandemonium
You pray for salvation
Your soul you would sell
Avoiding damnation
And those who reign in hell
A game for the liar
But who pays the price
The stakes getting higher
Take your chance and roll the dice
The shade can't disguise
The lies in your eyes
Give it to you on a plate
Take it from the one you hate
Eleventh hour fuck up
Bite the head that feeds & walk away
Loaded in your head
Believe the things you've said
Loaded in your eyes
Out of sight and out of mind
Loaded in your mind
The truth is hard to find
Loaded walk away
and live to die another day
It's all there for the taking
But how far can you run
There's no use in repenting
The damage has been done
Every waking moment
You're living on the edge
Welcome to the judgement day
You're staring down the barrel
You light a match
And watch it start a fire
You take a drug
That makes you fall much higher
You plant a seed
And grow a field of fury
You make a law
Where you're the judge and jury
It's firelight
You suffocate
Denying all his glory
You meditate
It's not your fuckin story
You flick a switch
To set the scene in darkness
You break a law
Where you collect the profits
It's firelight
You sit it out
Refusing condemnation
You take a shot
Pretending it's a play thing
You plant a bomb
Forget to set the timer
You wake up dead
The fireligh reminds you
The fire's out
From blackened flame
Ye shall remain
Ballistic brethren
Dark souls in pain
Defecate on the teachings
Burn into the dirt
Suffocate all the preachings
Bury them in earth
All hail!
Black flame of satan
From frozen fire

Defecate on the teachings

Cross your heart and hope to die
You superstitious fool
Yours is not to question why
Yours is to obey the rules

You're gonna crash and burn
Inferno
You're gonna burn in hell
Blood eyes in burning fury
Flesh peeling from the bone
The Gods are judge and jury

Welcome to purgatory
Your soul is fried

Welcome to the house of pain
You're insane
I could feel you dying
Again and again and again
I believed you were lying
Now I know you're insane
House of pain

Feel you die in vain
As your flesh started seething
In your house of pain
House of pain
Welcome to the house of pain

Old man death sits all alone
In quiet contemplation
Picking at his blackened nails
Waiting for his next victim
Watching as your life force drains
Your end is nigh
Happily he comes to take your soul
Before you die
Old man death
Death and dying
Old man death expressionless
Staring into nowhere
Duty bound collecting souls
Pleas for mercy wasted
He's the one stands at the gates
Past death's immigration
Take a ride to the other side
Don't ask dumb questions
Old man death angel accursed
King of afterlife
Ancient as the sands of time
His tempus fugit cries
With a choice of short and swift
Or everlasting pain
Old man death decides your fate
Death is all the same
Old man death
Death and dying
When they opened the gates
We emerged from the dark
There was no turning back
We go straight for your throat
Our time has come
Through the wars of the damned
We bring darkness and death
To your sacred land
See that look in your eye
Like a long lost child
But your reign had to end
You're a poison and dead
Our time is here
Through the wars of the damned
We bring darkness and death
To your dying land
We lasted throughout
Despite holy lies
Impotent to deny
The extinction of sin
Broken churches lay bare
Now their mental oppression
Saying nought but prayers
Our time is about
Through unholy wars
You are over and out
Damned day walkers
Don't let it be said you'd be better off dead
Words will get mixed up inside of your head
When you're playing the game can't remember your name
You know it's fucked up the same
You and me got a lot to say but I won't get down on my knees and pray
Loud and proud I fight every day
Fighting back
Come what may
A good day to die 
A cold grave to lie
A good day to die
The lies and the greed of the demon seed
World of the ignorant trying to breed
Never settled the score as I opened the door
But you kept wanting more
You and me got a lot to say but I won't get down on my knees and pray
Loud and proud I fight every day
Kicking back
Come what may
A good day to die
Stand up and fight
A cold grave to lie
This secret lie
Good day to die
No time to cry
You tried to fly
Reach for the sky
With your Russian roulette you'll take the bet
Sleeping on coals that you'll live to regret
In an orgy of death and your crimes and the tests
Is this your final breath?
You and me got a lot to say but I won't get down on my knees and pray
Loud and proud I fight every day
Fighting back
Come what may
Homicidal maniac
No shadow
No name
Ultimate hunter
Playing ultimate game
Patience awaiting prey
No conscience for his deeds
Deals another deathblow
So his thirst can feed
Psychopathic slayer
Destroyer 
Blood cold
Ultimate butcher
Playing ultimate show
Matador par excellence
Travels incognito
In this concrete jungle
He's king and it's his world
There's no going back
It's time to attack
He's just signed your death warrant
Watch them die
Drain their lives
Kill the bastards
Annihilation soldier
Malignant
Insane
Ultimate killer
Seeking ultimate fame
Desperado killing spree
A bloodbath night and day
Violent extremist
Pray he don't get your name
A sense of doom the warning
This is our Christ returning
The tide of fear arising
We light the candles to sing
Lucifer rising
Rising
Lucifer rising
Look into the light
Lucifer rising
Rising
Lucifer rising
A sense of tread the danger
We welcome the dark stranger
To bring infernal glory
Rewrite biblical stories
A hopelessness foreboding
Forgotten tales corroding
The laughter turns to crying
While Nazarene lies dying
They came looking for trouble
But then they found me
Now you'd better off dead son
Than if you fucked with me
When the walls come crashing down
And your life turns to ash
I'm every cunt who give a shit
And sold your soul for drugs and cash
I am a nightmare
I am a nightmare stalking
The blessed dead
I'm gonna fuck up your head
And trample on your bones
You thought you'd hit and run
You'll wish you stayed at home
When you know the end is nigh
And all your dreams are dead
Just remember I'm the one
Who put bad thoughts in your head
The blessed dead
Gonna fuck you up
They came looking for action
But never bargained on me
Now they wish that they were dead
What a sad sight to see
When the walls come crashing down
And your life turns to ash
I'm every cunt who gives a shit
And sold your soul for drugs & cash
Lost in the shadows, 
gaze into the void
Feeding the bastards, 
rebirth or destroy
Hours of darkness
Turn on the night
Awaken ebony
Begin twilight
Late in December coldness deadly chill
The night is calling, it's kill or be killed
Kill kill
Be killed
Kill kill
Be killed
Kill
Fading to blackness
Flat out on your back
Reveals the answer
the time to attack
Hours of darkness
Turn on the night
Awaken ebony
Begin twilight
Hours of darkness
Turn into the night
Eclipse is darkening
Black wings flight
There's no one to save us, it's kill or be killed
Living in a jungle you'll hunt with all your skills
Waiting for a victim, your hunger must be fed
Better see it coming or you will end up dead
Taste the anger
I'm seeing red
Feel the danger
Sleep when I'm dead
There's no time for mercy, there's no need for sympathy
Line of fire and chaos in a world of constant greed
Don't let your guard down, they'll be on you in a flash
Keep it locked and loaded, you're heading for a crash
There's no second chances
You're going full speed
Headlong into danger
Your habit needs a feed
Can't put the brakes on your finished when you stop
There's no tomorrow and yesterday is lost
Dark ages
Plague rages
Satan lives
Death races
Dead faces
666
Tormented
Demented
Relentless
No saviour
You die here
Reaper says
Bleeding demon souls
Falling down
Death in every town
All around
Some call it the end
Calling now
No one wears a crown
Speaking loud in ancient tongue
Worship moon or worship sun
From the knowledge of the old
Come the tales of mighty souls
Rise
Fall
Into hell
In the lightning in the skies
I can see it in your eyes
Armageddon will arise
And the planets will collide
Rise
Fall
Into hell
Into hell
Time to die
Old and wise
You and I
All a lie
Angels die
Life denied
The gates slam in your face
Chill creeps down your spine
No one will let you in
Your guilty of the crimes
The judge and jury shout
Redemption denied
You're going straight to hell
You're going straight to hell
You hear them calling
Dark figures start the game
Then you start falling
They're calling out your name
No place in purgatory
You're heading for the flames
You scream repentance
Dressed in sackcloth and ash
But they won't save you
You're sentenced for the lash
No time to make amends
Satan starts to laugh
Messiah the liar burning in Hell's fire
Forsaken awaken tragedy destiny
Magdalene open sin laughing crying
Enemy insanity Nazarene forgives thee
The Power and the Glory
Arrogant sycophant up on high on a rant
Terminate agitate bring him down with a bang
Pity ye old clergy grovelling beasting
Tear them down hear me now tear them down now
The Power and the Glory
They say the Devil wore black
As He walked through the pack
Of the unsuspecting fools
They were transfixed by the stars
And the words from afar
Using post hypnotic tools
When the enemy came
They were really all to blame
And who's cheating in the game
Open wide run a mile genocide taking lives
Tetragram holy man solitude living lies
Power trip papal sick ludicrous and unwise
Misanthrope from a rope on a cross die
The Power and the Glory
Watch the Holy war
Armies by the score
Is this all that we deserve
Look around and see
All the killing fields
Like a lesson we must learn
All the misery
Hand of God
Violence and disease
Hand of God
Population losing faith
Devastating crime
Hand of God
No respect for life
Hand of God
Challenges that we must face by the Hand of God
Desolate angels
Ride tsunami swells
Blame the climate on mankind
They say he sees all
Watching as we fall
Turns his back like he is blind
All the misery
Hand of God
Violence and disease
Hand of God
Population losing faith
Devastating crime
Hand of God
No respect for life
Hand of God
Challenges that we must face
by the Hand of God
Look deep inside
I shall fear no evil
Watch with evil eyes
I shall fear no evil
Look inside the shadow
valley of the shadow
The valley of the shadow of death
I shall fear no evil
When the end is near
And all there is fear
Can't justify those old beliefs
Raise your voice and yell
Smash the old church bells
Get up off your bended knees
All the misery
Hand of God
Violence and disease
Hand of God
Population losing faith
Devastating crime
Hand of God
No respect for life
Hand of God
Challenges that we must face
by the Hand of God
Myths and legends gather pace
Victims of the human race
Looks like a chemical war
Leaves you calling out for more
In the realm of danger signs
Forces you to commit crimes
In the end it's all it takes
You and all you know forsakes
fall from grace
Born amidst a holy war
Sow the seeds with hook and claw
Blood rich soil increases yield
Growing in the battlefield
You can't know the future see
In a coma on your knees
Whispers from a smokey stake
Hypocrite for your god's sake
fall from grace
Fall from grace
Frozen in a timeless gaze
Nothing left, you fall from grace
What's the point in killing time
Waiting for your time to die
Leave the lies for yesterday
Chasing dragons every way
Crack it open with a pick
All at once it makes you sick
fall from grace
All the hate in this world I adore
Thousands of legions
With black heart core
Riding high are my horsemen of four
Nothings safe 
No one cares that's a fact
Hell
unholy kingdom ruled by war
Hell
pain and fury is the law
Hell
fire and brimstone I desire
Hell
Satan on his throne of fire
There's no love
For the priestess of hate
Babylon nests
In her kingdom and wars
Evil sanctuary screams and gyrates
Living hell
lake of fire
infernal
On the night that
The black angel fell
I opened the gate
For an entrance to hell
When he saw his
New kingdom to dwell
Set alight in the fire of his rage
Looks across tile land
immortal through
The timeless sand
guttural
An ancient quest
an ancient rite
To find perfection evil
Demonic possession
Satanic aggression
My evil perfection
Demonic aggression
Satanic possession
My evil perfection
Evil comes or age
look at me
Turn another page
impatiently
A long lost dream
a long lost soul
To seek perfection evil
Calling out his name
religiously
Crowley went insane
undoubtedly
A book of spells
a curse of death
Beware perfection evil
Evil perfection
Evil intentions
no apprehensions
Never repents when
consumed with greed
A dark alliance
forget compliance
Ever defiant
that's how it's seen
Stab you in the back
A vicious vampyr burning in hellfire
Religious satire won't save your soul
Forget the passion 
accursed lies and
He takes it all on
then you're the fool
Stab you in the back
Smell the stench of the sick and the dying
Hear the cry of the lost ones denying
Hear the crack of your back, nothing's left
The soul surrenders
death remembers
Armageddon
end of days
Pay the price for the world now ending
Cupboards bare all resources fading
It's too bad that you pray without trust
Life's diminished
our world's finished
Armageddon
end of days
Now the end is in sight, you're all crying
Soon we'll all turn to dust, I'm not lying
Looking back, it's a fact, you had wealth
Laugh ignorance
now pay penance
Armageddon
end of days
Armageddon 
Armageddon
The sad pretender reneges on every deal
Return to sender transparent lies revealed
The question corpses trapped
In a silent scream
Can't last the courses
Run a mile, kill the dream
The cult of larceny
Kill the music

There's no integrity
Kill the fucking music
You're paranoia at finding out the truth
Your game is over it's time to cut you loose
A final last chance to prove your doubters wring
Now there's no last laugh
Lost all cred, stole the song
The cult of larceny
Kill the music

You've no integrity
Kill the fucking music
She came to see you, offered it on a plate
Then panic struck you, pretending to be straight

Your life is unclean, work it out, time to quit
The cult of larceny
Kill the music

There's no integrity
Kill the fucking music
The cult of larceny
Kill the music - kick the habit
You've no integrity
Kill the fucking music
They pushed the button
And the sky turned instant black
They wouldn't heed the signs
Instead they heard attack
The end is nigh for this world
We scorched the skies
Now all we have is darkness
And our graves to lie
Metamorphosis
Mutant genesis
Just like the tales of old
And crazy scientist
We changed the DNA
Then flicked a coin and wished
Now like a ticking bomb
Genetic dynamite
A giant Frankenstein
Delivers wrong from right
Metamorphosis
Mutant genesis
Progressing three steps forward
Jumping ten steps back
Releasing hybrid germs
To multiply in packs
Mutated gene selections
What will we be
Heading off in all directions
Let's just wait and see
Metamorphosis
Dressed in black
dressed in black
Stressed in black
marches out to war
Screams attack
screams attack
Streams of black
for the overlord
Time to fight

Fight or flight
swift blow to the head
Blackened night
mercy for the dead
The blood sky's calling you
You don't know what to do
The skies are bleeding yeah
Scream and shout

Shout it out

Sharpened knife

Swallow the danger

live the rush
Tempt fate and do it
what’s the worst?
Open gates so hell floods out
Unleash the hordes
Twisted faces painful shouts
With knives and swords
Screaming vengeance anarchy
Tormented cries
Hungry beaten angry souls
Lost in lies
Centuries – torturing
Damnation of souls
Angels’ fate – end of days
Damnation of souls
Bible regulations
Man’s freedom of will
If you don’t conform to him
Fires and torment spills
You’ll be damned to blackened pits
Death by every means
Love the sinner hate the sin
Only he redeems
In the battle of the gods
Angels did defy
Vanquished into purgatory
To suffer not to die
Such an evil act to make
Of your children’s love
Harbouring eternal hale
For that god above
At the dawn when time began
Blink of raven’s eye
Prophecies of the great beast
That God could not deny
Frantic in creations for
A creature called mankind
With the gift of a free will
Let Satan in their mind
Cast from heaven
Damned to hell
In the beginning
Angels fell
With a choice to reign in hell
Or serve in heaven’s law
Angels did not hesitate
To take their chance below
Cherubim & seraphim
United in their quest
Lucifer would lead the way
The one he loved the best
Lies of heaven
Lies of hell
Through the ages
Mankind fell
Dragons rise
Then priests die
Heaven cries
Hell unites
man fights
Hypnotised
Broken laws
Predators
Satan’s hordes
In hell jaws
Heaven falls
Then no more
Look at the children of Fallen Angels
Free in a world of the Fallen Angels
No more lies
The fallen rise
Rich man poor man beggarman thief
You’re like a child with your beliefs
Writer fighter worker of chief
Let everybody down
Give me give me everyday beg
You feel down & banged your head
Junkie lies with a broken leg
You’ll never wear a crown
You are the beggarman
Beggarman thief
You are the beggarman
Big man small man comedy clown
You sing and dance sink & drown
Take a step & you fall down
It never is you fault
Lord and master sickening curse
In the back of your own hearse
I really don’t know which is worse
A milligram of salt
You are the beggarman
Beggarman thief
You are the beggarman
Rich man poor man beggarman thief
You take the piss, beggarman belief
Poor man beggarman liar & thief
The only life you know
Big man small man hero or clown
You live a life that’s grey & brown
Small man beggarman all fall down
Now it’s your time to go
Do you feel disgusted?
Have you found you guilty?
Do you hide your eyes?
Stealing your sanity
Pride will make them angry
Lust and greed they envy
Overdose gluttony
I am sloth & I’m bored with your
Lies about
Sin
Sin
Sin
Original Sin
Do you hide away?
Are your walls transparent?
For he sees it all
Your sadistic parent
Now you’ve found your way
and the truth was easy
Never gonna pray
For what’s mine and should be
When you’re least expecting my call
Or at the end
Life descends
Olden age you fall
Just remember I’m a promised fact
There’s no way around fate
No secret pact
Many through the ages they have tried
Believe me that I know
They all failed and died
Death be thy name
Searching for an ancient tale or myth
Read it on a book or heard it from the wind
Takes you to the edges of the earth
Even try to steal it from the newly breathed
But your efforts are a waste of time
You can’t hide forever
You’ll still be mine
I’m coming to get you…
Now the scientist misunderstood
Can’t make immortality inside a test tube
I don’t know if I should laugh or cry
Take it as an insult or credit you’re trying
But for now the old saying holds fast
He who laughs the longest is he
Who laughs last
They say the screams of terror from
The dying slaves and the loyal
We’re drowned out by the noise from
The blazing fires and sandstone walls
Which separated them from the
Procession outside who chanted
and sang aloud on this their most
Ceremonious of nights
Spirit of pharaohs
Rise to The stars
Their mortal shell stays 
In the Valley of the Kings
Worship the pharaohs
Children Of gods
Their earthly symbols 
In the Valley Of the Kings
The unheard cries of the tortured
Souls lay buried deep in the bowels
Made thick unearthly air with a sense
Of sinister foreboding
Even the cold night sky saw not a
Cloud nor star was moving
Caught in the crossfire of sadness and
Fear of the pyramid
In the Valley of the Kings
Did ancient man shake hands with gods?
Or were we treat like slaves and dogs?
A hybrid breed an experiment
Made in a lab purpose intent
Did we evolve as Darwin said?
Or interbreed with aliens instead?
Will they return just wait and see
Do you believe? The jury’s out for me
Can’t rule it out we’re not alone
Or are we first the great unknown?
Did we emerge from nature’s bed?
Ore were we put on earth by something else?
Woke up this morning
To the sound of nothingness
No dog to wag his tail or beg
Down and lonely they all just up and left
Don’t see why I should take another breath
Confess spit it out
I won't ask you twice
All hear the great noise
As you roam the night
The devil's mother's anger
Sister of the beast
Temptations ultra vile
All sins released
I'll ask the question
You will confess
Worshipping Satan
From the very depths
Rise up feel the fear
It's the witching Hour
Your septic dark familiars
Wild ceremonies
The vestal virgin cries
All blessed be
I'll ask the question
You will confess
Do you worship Satan?
From the very depths
Bit back blasphemy
What thou wilt command
The Witches pendle
Satan's Command
By torture inquisition
Do our dirty deeds
Burn all show no mercy
All cursed ye
Asking the question
Blood tears and sweat
Summoning Satan
From the very depths Of Hell
Beware my curse for I am ghost
From where I came in pain it ends
You're breathing in I'm taking out
I will destroy & I will shout
Smoke
Like a storm in the night
Rising up to take flight
Open your eyes they bleed and weep
Can't see your face in distant fires
Looking at pain in pleasure stale
I am the air that you inhale
Inhale my life my blackened lies
Filling the air I pity not
Forever young prepare to die
Glorious smoke I'm taking life
Smoke
As a storm never
Into infinity flies
It's like a drug tormenting
venting primal lust
Inventing hedonism
Aspirations rush
Temptation
Pain fighting urge
Temptation
Greed craving
Temptation
We invite stimulation addiction the lure
Attraction satisfaction insatiable cure
I give you motivation wanton
Slave to flesh
Voracious perspiration living
Close to death
Temptation
Pain fighting urge
Temptation
Greed craving
Temptation
The holy walls are falling down
Beyond the grave the saints renounce
Their hunting for the silent witness
The churches burn in desperate sickness
The pagan rites spread like disease
A lust of angels bursting dreams
Their loins are burning yearning life
Their sin original delights
Inside the oracle destroys
The sirens lure the men like boys
Enchanting songs to break your heart
An angel weeps as souls depart
All I see lies designed to suffocate and choke
Sacrifice hallowed be thy name
The mighty have fallen condemned are the priests
All you feel terror wrapped in pain
As you hang forsaken
In your hour of need
As we watch you die
Crucified
God of war fight the good fight hypocrite
Suffocate truth revealed as shame
It's a farce religion carnage and deceit
Roll the dice rapture never came
As you hang forsaken
In your hour of need
As we watch you die
Crucified
And I ask why, why in the blazing
fires of hell, snatched from Lillith's
womb, by bile and bitter, though
Lucifer's child, indeed a pure man, or
a god from an abomination I say to
all, come unto thee, whilst I breathe
and heart beat aloud
All alone now the vultures salivate your bones
Come to Hell see your words decay
The mighty have fallen condemned are the priests
It's a race souls aren't yours to save
As you hang forsaken
In your hour of need
As we watch you die
Crucified
Liar liar all I hear deceives
The blood is gonna boil
Make your mind up what should I believe?
the trouble and turmoil
The raging beast awakes
Tempers intensity
Malice brutality
Anger roars
Grinding teeth
Anger anger biting at the bit
The point of no return
There's no just spewing out your shit
You know you're gonna burn
The raging beast awakes
Tempers intensity
Malice brutality
Anger roars
Grinding teeth
Fighter fighter riding out of Hell
The leather and the speed
Make me stronger I'm the sentinel
I hit the road and bleed
The raging beast awakes
Tempers intensity
Malice brutality
Anger roars
Callous and merciless
Vicious oratory
Rhetorical debris
Anger roars anger roars
Anger roars and Grinding teeth
When you look in his eyes
You will see no reflection
His substance you rely
So embrace your depression
Now comes real pain asylum vacation
Summon his name the road to perdition
Do you feel justified?
No remorse for your actions
Will your wrath now decide?
Can't get no satisfaction
Now you're insane violent condition
Summon his name the lord of suspicion
Now you're losing your mind
Can't repent your decisions
What a waste of your life
Empty holy renditions
No one to blame solitary religion
Summon his name and reveal evil vision
Dark skies war cries to fight
She flies men rise who dies
Black fire in flight no sight
The wise in guise tonight
Wings of Valkyrie
Who rise decides their fates
Your pride in dark awakes
Wings of Valkyrie
Reprise in sight for all
No light in Hell they fall
Wings of Valkyrie
Wings of Valkyrie
All ye sinners rise raise your hands and fists
With fire in your eyes show no mercy
Ancient battle cries call to arms in war
Never compromise take no prisoners
Hold your head up high never we retreat
Made of flesh and blood we are perfect
Ancient battle cries metal to the core
Make them realise we are legions
All ye sinners rise fighting hands and fists
With fire in your eyes show no mercy
Ancient battle cries call to arms in war
Never compromise take no prisoners
It's time to die
Death stands behind the door
Satan sends his warriors
Demons break out of Hell
Shrill cries

Shrill cries
Outbreak of evil
With swords and axes
The fight hard
In a massacre

None can survive
People will destroy
Souls like hell

Dark call you to the throat of the
glowing hell lights of exist become extinet
and you read the epitaph of your grave
You are the chosen messenger of hell
Come execute your instruction with spell
You got magic power to all

Love to drink the blood of the slut
adore the bestial rite
eat the virgins heart warm and sweet
destroy the unborn holy meat
The Sepulchural Voice
mysterious groans torment your mind
the shadow of evil make you blind
a funeral song out of the burial place
damned you to hell from the human race
War!
Nuclear warheads are ready to fight
Total destruction the only might
We are all suicide, without brain
People are running and dying in pain
Burst command til war!
The overkill is near
Nobody feel the heavy fear
Thousand megatons dynamite
Wait to kill one life
Burst command til war!
We live our life in grieved desire
Our hopeless is getting higher
You cry for freedom, but nobody hear you
The end of the world is true
Burst command til war!
War, war, war
Burst command til war
Burst command til war
War!
A twilight was in my mind
Fulfilled of suspended bare foreboding
Great erhaulted forms of life
Touched me by my nightmare
Feel the inflamed impression in my soul
Appeared that I get blessed
DEATHLIKE SILENCE
DEATHLIKE SILENCE
Trustful eyes look up to me

Mistress of all cults
Cursed is your body
Until all severed end nears
Angels force be immortal
In presence of all the true
Stars grow in lonely nights
When the watcher rise
Intelligence awake to harmony
Barious terrible fears
Borrow symbolic mystery
Spiteful eyes in face of beaty

Prestige get paralyse
Martydom and servitude
Psychosis of a rabid sickless brood
Esoteric dreams a foreign man
Nocturnal flush, frenzied and rude
Buried in a nameless grave
Stand up again the world to save
The fear of darkness and of death
An ormament wedge
Sigh by prophecy
Bestial thought
Drive me in corupt
Hungry belussions
Inseparable huminilty
So man I came with lance and sword
Lead once more the legions of lord
Thrill with lissome lust of light
Come careing out of the night
Ascent to the virceous circle
In an era of fright and terror
A holy document
Hold in hands of unknown
Eradication, opulence
And parish noise
Mephisto the oppressor
Makes me so I like to feel
But I cant believe its true
The day when I arrive the paradies
I flog my horse to the hills of violation
I am that I am the flame
Hidden in a sacred ark
I am the unspoken name
And unbegotten spark
I am that ever goeth
Being myself the way
Supreme for creating words
None but I have ever heard
Emplorer of aeon
Plectren of primal paen
In the sea my father lies
Wept my waters lost forever
Where the waste of moe replieth
Naught nowhere and never
I will shine as he shone
Must go how he has gone

Forth from you and darksome cell
From deep abyss of hell
Coming to view the earth again
See if you can ease distempered brain
Fear and care doth pierce the soul
how angry furies howl

Holy spirits are norm
Male femate quintessential one
Man being veiled in woman form
Glory and worship in the highest
Thou dove mankind that defiest

Find no sacred ark to swim in
Remorseless realm of rain
My body wear of empty clasp
Strong as a lion, sharp as an asp
Coat of the flock, I am gold and god
Flesh to thy bone, flow to thy rod
With hoofs of steel I race on the rocks
Through solstice stubborn to

Delivered from the chains of subjection
Almighty his chivalry urge
Eriled in the crueltys clutch
Strenghed in the believe in himself
Growned with the charm of salomo
Halluzinations and mysterious
Drift him into an inconceivable war
He get stigmated in a holy war
Against apocalyptic mights
Nails claws in his own breast
Eyes so black as night
A red blazed aperture let see
Thee blood filled beating heart
He is an impetuous thundered god
His revenge get cruel
Hateful thought lead him
An almost intolerable sight
With a frightful weight
Demolish christian stamped bodies
Their tears and blood of
Deception and insidiousness
Doze away to the ground
Smash of imperium of
uncontroled religous expansion
Last furious warrior
Pursued by fire
Pack of hound behind him
Mankind hopeless fear
OBSESSED BY CRUELTY
Impalement for destroy
OBSESSED BY CRUELTY
Deadly, cold and grey
After carnage is over grinded bones
Covered the endless battlefield
Broken is the residence

He is an impetuous thundered god
Ashes to dust behind his ways
Urged by unveiled damnation
Mankind hopeless fear
OBSESSED BY CRUELTY
Inpalement for destroy
OBSESSED BY CRUELTY
Deadly, cold and grey
In a realm governed by gods scorn
Absorbed in solitudes deep
Where men and beast are one
Deads disturbed in eternal peace
There is a town of curse
Crueltys bleeding place
Dreadful illumation of lust
Squat behind the gates of proscription
A memorial that never somebody forget
Once by god created and destroyed
Meaned is the majesty town SODOM
Known in all world by reason of force
Fall of majesty town
SODOM and gomorrah
Fire bring it down
Fall of majesty town

Deprived by crown

Raise swords in name of satan
Burn all crucifixion
Symbols of wrong oath
Drive lemdness and let em learn the crime
Kill and hate all these which loved you
Use arms of agony and grieve
Follow your leader with incence obedience
Because only known the battles upshot
A memorial that never somebody forget
Once by god created and destroyed

The revence came from exception strong power
An indescrible vandalism action
Disperse the place in innumerable bloodspots
Death is unruly and everywhere
Smell of becahed flesh
Controls the occorrence
Feel hudder of hideous inferno
In their unity demons god
Loose craftiness and scorn
Firesnakes reel around
Lightnings praise let glow in jows sing
Souls return to visit isolated graves
The moment came where circles angulars burn
Lights of darkness
Hour of witchcraft and sorcery
Heavenly sphere voice strike up
High magics memorial
Creators perfection
A fire that gives life to all animate
creatures
Leaded from will clear men
Initates exhault handsand your sorrow get allayed

Carry gods message from one world to another
And the deed of eternal fire is done
Subbdue your bad attributes and
All phantomes of imagination
Understand the harmony of four elemental forces
Hierarchy of occultism lession
Ghosts would beware of great favour
In their power and freedom invincible
Sitting on a throne of genocide
Our master regal and glory
Subject for suppressions land
Fairness find no place to expand
All his soldiers di to live
In labyrints of death
Buring temples in town of spell
Prepared for damnation to hell
Young blood envoyed
From endless starlight
Behats in right season
For ending the treason
PRETENDERS TO THE THRONE
Betrayed, forgotten and alone
PRETENDERS TO THE THRONE
Our mighty child is born
You confirm me by oath with magic signs
Possesses from your masterhs brightness
You bring me forms of ever open eyes
Token erect of thorny thigh
In his tyrannical lust
He kills and tortured all who sreams
In god we trust
Raise the merciless fight
Against a wird might
Come on, lets overthrow only chance
Change of sovereign is our deliverance
PRETENDERS TO THE THRONE
A queen so old as time
Secred beauty
Under female ruins
Whom she touched run cold
In buring regions
Of her empire
the thriumph about
Life and death
She teached you perversity
From birth til eternity
Every time we want to tug
Delivered the vibrating cleft
She slides to right and left
Feel her damp walls
In wild orgies
She is enslaved to show
Damned and outlawed
Her open wound
Lewd and abnormal
She pleads for fuild of love
Hungry and insatiable
Hot as fire of vulcano
She teached you perversity
From birth til eternity
Every time we want tug
Delivered the vibrating cleft
She slides to right and left
Feel her damp walls
Run up the spiral staircase to annihilation
Deserted neglected into the dark
Devitalised souls cripple the planet in greed
Proceed until we are absorbed in blood
Causing the premature burial of nature
With the spark to a powder keg
Pining up their toys on the shoulders of the nation
Turning death into universal heir
Make us die slowly
Nuclear winter
Clouds of dust will hide the sun forever, celebrate
Nuclear winter
Blows straight into your heart
Nuclear winter
Day of tomorrow we'll go through
Make your testament
Nuclear winter
Luminaries become dall structures
Atmospheric cataclysm is the result
Epileptic doom of lacerated cannibals
Wrapped up the earth in a shroud
Eternal darkness artificial brightness
Exclusive possession of death
Defaced skulls of radiation
Mutilated past recognition
Make us die slowly
Nuclear winter
Clouds of dust will hide the sun forever, celebrate
Nuclear winter
Blows straight into your heart
Nuclear winter
Day of tomorrow we'll go through
Make you testament
Nuclear winter
Slow death is what we can expect
Strike will have just this one effect
Condemned to capital punishment
By the nuclear sword of Damocles
Disappeared without leaving a trace
Mans dignity and grace
Infected by intruder organism
Changed into weak willed subjects
Ineradicable misanthropy
We stick to nothing
Instinct of self preservation
Spreading venereal disease
Gods of war and vengeance
Commander with good conscience
Use our soul for research
In favour of nuclear technology
Arrived at the end of the spiral staircase
At the doorstep to immortality
Not reached the destination of our dreams
Decided in the struggle for existence
Life has lost, death has won the game
The length of our longing
Shall be the strength of our glory
Damocles proud and mighty among men
Make us die slowly
Nuclear winter
Clouds of dust will hide the sun forever, celebrate
Nuclear winter
Blows straight into your heart
Nuclear winter
Day of tomorrow we'll go through
Make you testament
Nuclear winter
Authorised to kill, fuming with rage
Urged by sexual instinct
Absorbed massacre, casualties
No chance to get away
Bloodthirstiness, dismemberment
Pathological satisfaction
Stimulated thoughts, increased wantonness
Until redeemed climax
Time will come to balance the account
Send you legally to hell
Electric chair is reserved sure enough
Your death struggle rings the bell
Brutal rapes, child mistreated
Unscrupulous crimes
Greed of flesh, naked skin
There is no relent
Wince bodies, torn genitals
Stamped by sadism
Chasted newborns, attractive females
Indescribable ecstasies
Time will come to balance the account
Send you legally to hell
Electric chair is reserved sure enough
Your death struggle rings the bell
Intimate kisses, secret wishes
With corporal beings
Ardent love, shameless intercourse
Just make sure it moves
Unmerciful disfigurement, a fleshy joy
Heart warming death
Coursing of souls, suck up the blood
Totally insane
Authorised to kill, fuming with rage
Urged by sexual instinct
Bloodthirstiness, dismemberment
Pathological satisfaction
Time will come to balance the account
Send you legally to hell
Electric chair is reserved sure enough
Your death struggle rings the bell
Dark night nothing to see
Invisible hand in front of me
Scared to death there's some one near
Scared to move but you can't stay here
You know me, evil eye
You know me, prepare to die
You know me, the snakebites kiss
Devils grip, the iron fist
Flying horse don't make a sound
Flying hooves don't touch the ground
Walk in circles loose your tracks
Can't go on but you can't go back
You know me, evil eye
You know me, prepare to die
You know me, you can't resist
Devils grip, the iron fist
Moon eclipse and you know why
Ghost rider in the sky
Beast of evil devil's hound
Tooth and claw they pull you down
You know me, evil eye
You know me, prepare to die
You know me, the snakebites kiss
Devils grip, the iron fist
Command to Vietnam
Back into the jungles depth
Armed to the teeth
Cold blooded experienced
Mercenary paid to slaughter
Sector madness kill and destroy
Missing captive locked up
In contaminated camps
Only war of liberation
Let them gather fresh hope
Hostile crossfire finished eight lives
Bowels bury me alive
Green hell swallows a silhouette
I could get away
Persecution Mania, driven me mad
Persecution Mania, tremendous dreams
Persecution Mania, getting mentally ill
Persecution Mania, alarmed about my life
There are traps behind every line
The combat zone in trench and fire
I know the danger every step
The nerve gas falls in black and white
But slowly I near my destination
Lost is our war to do justice
The brothers of people shot and died
Persecution mania takes away my life
Persecution Mania, driven me mad
Persecution Mania, tremendous dreams
Persecution Mania, getting mentally ill
Persecution Mania, alarmed about my life
Something fierce
Something evil
Circles in the air
From the dawn of time we came
To find the place of promise
Moving silently down
Through war disabled centuries
Living many secret lives
Unrecognised by human eyes
Struggling to reach the aim
To dwell in perpetuality
We are the messengers
Of inmost thought
Our words of confession
Fall away to nought
Domination of the universe
Contains our vital interests
Swift coursing blood of our veins
Cured the grieving pains
When the few who remain
Will battle to the last
For enchanted lands
Take charge of reign
Leave behind the past
Early history in our hands
Living in the land of promise
Beyond the other world
Our mission is done
Fear neither men nor fates
Pray for disease
But escape your soul
Duration of 100 lives
Get the worlds undoing
Because no one ever knows
We are among you
From the dawn of time we came
To find the place of promise
Moving silently down
Through war disabled centuries
Living many secret lives
Unrecognised by human eyes
Struggling to reach the aim
To dwell in perpetuality
We praise the saviour
Observe the ten commandments
Confess our sins
For time immortal
Man's mind gets inspired
By gift and faculty divine
Blind superstition
Religious liberty
Mitigate our sorrows
Living in a world of dreams
Don't fear the true
Image of a God
Infant Jesus was crucified
A memorial for our future
Our atrocity is now forgiven
Because he has done his penance
Hear me people of sighing
Sorrow of pain and regret
Left to the dead and dying
You, that not know me as yet
Christ passion
Medieval extravagance of Christianity
Foundation in all cultmysteries
Holy customs and wholesale hysteria
Creeds to transcendental
Defecation of human nature
Devour them up with blindness
They are fool adore in all clergy
And mindful in the grace of god
Christ passion
Mortal way of life
Rapture of the earth
Lift up your heads
In the day of his wrath
In the worst hour of life
Looking into the eyes of death
Extreme unction nears
Intensive incense is befooled
He gives you unimaginable joy
Certainty and faith
To find unutterable peace
Demand no sacrifice
Christ passion
Expect no wonders celestial child
He will behold your repentance
His prophet revealed to the wise
The great mystery of god
Persecution of Christians in blasphemy
Born by the scum of evil
Almighty father knows no thirst for revenge
Praise the saviour on all saints' day
An almost dark vault
There meet the maniacs
Burning flickering candles
Smell of blood and death
Please the favour of the black
Earthery joys at midnight
In the horror creep and crawl
No one knows what's wrong or right
Terror comes as an invasion
And the pain pulls you down
Conjuration
The ceremony can begin
Last super to the evil
Crowned with thorns black rose
Crucified to the rites of fall
Tarred and feathered
Black holy relics offered
The ram in priestly form
Says the mass in black and blood
Terror comes as an invasion
And the pain pulls you down
Conjuration
Blasphemy of the sacrament
To the glory of the dark
Virgin dance and chanting
Wear the burning mark
The rising of the corpse begins
Through prayer oath and howl
They rip to pieces what doesn't fly
They strike with naked fist
Terror comes as an invasion
And the pain pulls you down
Conjuration
Terror comes as an invasion
And the pain pulls you down
Conjuration
As we heard the threatening sirens
Warned against the bombing raid
We cowered in a shelter
They left us to our fate
Stukas dived to bring is mortal dreed
Bombs fell down as rain
Explosions shook the ground
Debris is buried the dead again
Waiting for the painful decision
Senseless action of Germans on and on
Only suicides delivered is from suffering
What does the future have in store
It's time to die
Death stands behind the door
Satan sends his warriors
Demons break out of hell
Shrill cries
Angel dies
Shrill cries
Outbreak of Evil
With sword and axes
The fight hard
In the massacre
They feel the hot smart
Shrill cries
Angel dies
Shrill cries
Outbreak of Evil
No one survives
People will destroy
Souls like hell
Where devils make a toy
Shrill cries
Angel dies
Shrill cries
Outbreak of Evil
Behind the scenery of destiny
I adore you in this song for me
Call me within your holy house to dwell
Let me raise for myself in spell
Voluptuously dancing daughters of night sky
Sing the rapturous love song with high
Let your sweet scented juice run
Waste away under the lashes of my whip
Bathe in sin
Sadistic souls
Break their crust
Sodomy and lust
Carnal desire runs through my veins
Whipping boys and scapegoats cry in pain
Psychopathic terror during their sleep
My power ask why, my power is weak
Spineless bundles of my excess
Expurse of innocence and helplessness
In the perfumes of my secret orison
Fresh blood of children drops down on me
Bathe in sin
Sadistic souls
Break their crust
Sodomy and lust
Madness, crime, disgrace, ptomaine
Excrements, contempt, violence, kill
Ordeals of thousand deads congleaded in gloom
Strike hard and deep, to hell with 'em, master
Mighty prophets stature shall surpass the stars
My passion is the smell of cremation
I spit on your crapulous creed, curse 'em!
Sucking you giveth delight and bright glory
Strive ever to be more joyous to the death
Don't fear any god will deny you for this
Bathe in sin
Sadistic souls
Break their crust
Sodomy and lust
Company of heaven has sent us a chosen apostle
To the treasure of damned
Blessing no longer be poured the mystical lord
Covered with rich headdress
He will proceed his way over the line
Furious as tiger
Once the tower rocked and cracked beneath its lash
Caught inextinguishable fire
Conqueror
The lord of host gave ear into his song
Intolerable blackness helms him
Only the lightning from his hand that sits
When usurping tyrants fall
An unsullied maid baffles his seductions and his ire
Pines in the prison
Compassion is the vice of kings
Stamp down the wretched weak
Conqueror
You are not of the slaves that perish
Pity 'em not
Tear down that lying spectre of centuries
Vices in virtuous words
We'll hide in a smash of sorrow
You shall fear
Let your rites be rightly performed
With joy and beauty
Conqueror
We worship our abomination of desolation
With fire, blood, swords and reverence
See that hour blessed splendour in my name
War engines and battles of conquest are atheism
Glory in the highest heaven
Hear my atonement
We will return to the victorious city
For a proof to the world
Support us, be ready to fly or to smite
Gimme the sign of silence after the adoration
Verily you shall not die but live in console
Caressed by magnificent beasts of women
Unassuaged of purpose, delivered from lust
Not hell's heart hath so noxious a shade
Hear my atonement
See the gun high velocity
Levelled to my heart
Magazine filled with hollow points
Bullets invented to slaughter
They activate the trigger
I get fired to the wall
Pain is pungent stops my life
Hear the last bell toll
Tired and red the ways I gonna die
Tired and red squirm, to plead to dry
Tired and red confirm by oath the death
Tired and red to my last breath
See the knife flash the sun
The knife that makes me run
Sharp and made of stainless steel
Not wholesome to feel
Stab me to the ground - Why?
Falling down to see the sky
My eyes are closed now day is night
Never wake to see the light
Tired and red the ways I gonna die
Tired and red squirm, to plead to dry
Tired and red confirm by oath the death
Tired and red to my last breath
See the chair one thousand volts
Invite to sit down
With closed eyes and fettered limbs
Contacts decorate an iron crown
Overseer turns on the switch
Small sparks squirt out my head
High amperage my body shook
In the claws of death
Tired and red the ways I gonna die
Tired and red squirm, to plead to dry
Tired and red confirm by oath the death
Tired and red to my last breath
Scour to find new ways of love
Denounce moralisers
Ethic without prohibition and laws
Give no credence to church
Satisfaction in the sign of crime
The meaning of my life
There is no sin all down the line
No repentance pay the price
Number one in the list of misdeeds
Persuade my sister
She shook and gasped in licentious greed
Turned by mutual whisper
Wrapped up in bewitched body shower
Forbidden fruits taste better
Primitive caress to burn out the power
Nymphomania dressed in leather
Incest
Incest
Incest
You take your virtues in a tow
And commit a sin
By defects in your character
You will always imagine
The number of all your virtues
Wipe out the stains and outrage
Realise your exceptional dreams
Incest grin and bear it
You take your virtues in a tow
And commit a sin
By defects in your character
You will always imagine
The number of all your virtues
Wipe out the stains and outrage
Realise your exceptional dreams
Incest grin and bear it
My inclination is a portrait of myself
When I look inside the broken glass
Enjoy sweetest lust and I am feeling well
Moral dilemma without wrath
Crave for you in ecstasy of my mind
Love you to the quick
Don't know what has happened to me
The condition of a bitch
Incest
Incest

Honour the fallen heroes
See their last resting place
Perished in the battle of nations
Where they found eternal peace
Do you know the use of their decorations?
Awarded for patriotism
They left their life in fire
But don't know even why
Remember the fallen
Remember the fallen
To the command of despotic dictators
They marched to fight in a senseless war
Most of them were just puppets and children
The battle was lost before it began
Brotherly in heart and hand
Know that they never come back
With combined effort
And the believe in god
Their duty only as cannon fodder
Kamikaze as living bombs
Driven into the open knife
Deceitful and malicious
Remember the fallen
Remember the fallen
Their tormented souls will never rest
To pay us back for their innocent death
No quarter shed our proud blood
Retaliation on the warpath
They fight with drowsiness
Rubbed their eyes must stay awake
Stared into the darkness
Disastrous noise from far behind
Imminent attack splits their minds
Forces proceed to counter thrust
Without doubt they will rush
Moon cast a shadow menace comes near
Formed as an aeroplane
Take up weapons to defend the boundary line
Do not want to loose the reign
Disastrous noise from far behind
Imminent attack splits their minds
Forces proceed to counter thrust
Without doubt they will rush
Night into day when flare bombs detonate to burn the sky
Our hostile positions are made out there is no place to hide
The AC-47 send their flames from all the barrels
6000 shots per minute to make a hill all level
Let sheets of fire hail down the base
A crucial test the enemy will never raise
Spit tracer bullets expose our hiding place
Iron monsters destroy with rage
Pilots circle their machines as eagles in the sky
Navigator tactical warfare they know the reason why
Because their orders are clear
Crush them to win the war
Let sheets of fire hail down the base
A crucial test the enemy will never raise
Spit tracer bullets expose our hiding place
Iron monsters destroy with rage
First squadron obey the command
Take off higher
Let sheets of fire hail down the base
A crucial test the enemy will never raise
Spit tracer bullets expose our hiding place
Iron monsters destroy with rage
Arena filled with screaming crowd
In ecstasy they cry
Paid money for a pleasant show
Want to see him die
The matador in shining dress
Intent to prove his courage
Drove by rejoicing mass
It boils his pulsing blood
Exhibition bouts under the star of law
Men make pleasure in hanging gore
Cruelty to animals crime that won't get punished
Creatures treated as rubbish
With direct stabs into living flesh
To agonise the bull
No way out the fronts are clear
Take offensive jab it though
On and on ride to the fall
In danger of his life
Wounded find no place to hide
Death will soon arrive
Exhibition bouts under the star of law
Men make pleasure in hanging gore
Cruelty to animals crime that won't get punished
Creatures treated as rubbish
Blood soaks and stains the parched ground
The slaughter to inaugurate
Duel between man and beast
Their eyes are filled with hate
He restrained fierce at the eleventh hour
Till death blows save his soul
No right to exist lamentation is law
His flesh served up a grub
Now finds piece in a better world
Where man and beast are one
Arena was filled with screaming crowd
He is dead and they are gone
Exhibition bouts under the star of law
Men make pleasure in hanging gore
Cruelty to animals crime that won't get punished
Creature treated as rubbish
We've drudged many decades to live free from care
The war began it was enough to drive us to despair
A time when bread was more worth than pure gold
We missed the warmness saved us from the wintry cold
No trade with death
No trade with arms
Dispense the war
Learn from the past
Slogans to hold out until end dreams ramble to the sky
Evacuated far away we left everything behind
Fifty hundredweight bombs dashed us to the ground
When military air raids stormed the land abound
No trade with death
No trade with arms
Dispense the war
Learn from the past
Death
Arms
War
Past
Political tyranny exercised by morbid despots
Bombardment of fire wasn't win but loss
Corpses buried under ruins and debris
No more war the solution all the nation need
No trade with death
No trade with arms
Dispense the war
Learn from the past
Product of my breeding
Inauspicious shapes
Formed by depravity
Abnegation of my past
Resigning, ireful
Watching the depopulation
Danger, impotence
Envelope the world with fear
Unnatural decay
Disclose the human need
Ptomaine, cremation
Baptism of fire we'll not survive
Abject and spirited
Getting excessive with results
Dislike a normal life
Excruciating waste away
Resigning, ireful
Watching the depopulation
Danger, impotence
Envelope the world with fear
Unnatural decay
Disclose the human need
Ptomaine, cremation
Baptism of fire we'll not survive
Symptoms of pathogenia
Depropotionate your body
Incurable disfigurement
Bones decompose alive
Resigning, ireful
Watching the depopulation
Danger, impotence
Envelope the world with fear
Unnatural decay
Disclose the human need
Ptomaine, cremation
Baptism of fire we'll not survive
Return to biogenetics
Turn over a new leaf
To form a vicious circle
Till end of time
Get down six feet under
I wish she would, your fat blanket mother
She growls and roars like thunder
A mouth so big, the eighth world wonders
She wants me to throw her daughter away
And pick her up instead...
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Yes another cunning plot, to get me under her covers
Dior stockings and nothing on top
She ain't like a normal mother
I wish I was a million miles away
So I can't hear her say...
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
When will this dreadful nightmare end?
I really don't want another
That fat blanket woman drives me round and bend
How can you get lower when hell is in the gutter
I wish I was a million miles away
So I can't hear her say...
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Oh great God, If you really exist
For many years, I am asking you why
Why are the innocent dead and the guilty alive?
Where is justice? Where is punishment
Something big is brewing
You can see it in my eyes
They burn with a beastly hatred
That will be realised
Why are the innocent dead?
Come on god, answer me
Why are the guilty alive?
Don't want to be deceived
They think they are above the law
They're trying to break my spine
Where is justice, where is punishment
Where is the human line
An eye for an eye
Inveterate despite
An eye for an eye
A one man war on crime
As I began to talk to god
I've even lost my mind
I only want to know one thing
What I've done, was it wrong or right
Why are the innocent dead?
Come on god, answer me
Why are the guilty alive?
Don't want to be deceived
They think they are above the law
They're trying to break my spine
Where is justice, where is punishment
Where is the human line
An eye for an eye
Inveterate despite
An eye for an eye
A one man war on crime
An eye for an eye
Inveterate despite
An eye for an eye
A one man war on crime
A loving husband, devoted father
Till the day the mob opened the fire
Retaliation and vindictiveness
His only mission and ardent desire
Why are the innocent dead?
Come on god, answer me
Why are the guilty alive?
Don't want to be deceived
They think they are above the law
They're trying to break my spine
Where is justice, where is punishment
Where is the human line
An eye for an eye
An eye for an eye
The cover of darkness no longer conceals
An approaching enemy
There are many ways to kick some ass
With updated technology
You will always get on your knees
In the war you're gonna fight
Prevent agreements between nations
No democracy but more genocide
Keep your eyes open your under control
There is something that's over the top
Penetration and power sends bullets of lead
Inside your body to do the job
Shellfire defense
Pray to god that he will take you in his hands
Shellfire defense
You wish to get the final shot
That makes your nightmare end
Eliminate the threat and minimise the risk
Supremacy against the attacks
New weapons in front of fighting troops
They get no chance for shooting back
Who gave you the criminal passions?
Inclinations to kill
Retribution demand victims
No matter what you feel
Keep your eyes open your under control
There is something that's over the top
Penetration and power sends bullets of lead
Inside your body to do the job
Shellfire defense
Pray to god that he will take you in his hands
Shellfire defense
You wish to get the final shot
That makes your nightmare end
Shellfire defense
Pray to god that he will take you in his hands
Shellfire defense
You wish to get the final shot
That makes your nightmare end
Long vanished is the age of blows with a club
Wholesale murder guarantee
Soldiers within the meaning of law
Decimate the dregs of society
Where's man's dignity and human nature?
Disarmament and combination
Fit in with the needs of present
Peace not revelation
Keep your eyes open your under control
There is something that's over the top
Penetration and power sends bullets of lead
Inside your body to do the job
Shellfire defense
Pray to god that he will take you in his hands
Shellfire defense
You wish to get the final shot
That makes your nightmare end
Slazing scents taint with blood
Signed his path of death
Trace him to the place of fright
Searching for his daily bread
When midnight comes around
Be warned because he is out of sight
What carnal secrets does he hide
His ruthless rage will come
Buried deep inside his mind
The rites of the saw began
The saw is the law
The saw is the law
Executed children
Laughing mothers by their side
Feel the pain of ripping flesh
Those who've died
Have paid the price
And drawn their final breath
What carnal secrets does he hide
His ruthless rage will come
Buried deep inside his mind
The rites of the saw began
The saw is the law
The saw is the law
What carnal secrets did he hide
His worries of the flesh have come
With tears in his eyes and a gun in his hand
So ends the story of the chainsawman
The saw is the law
The saw is the law
I can really safely say
That you're still alive
One thing they can't take away
Is your will to survive
I know I won't believe it
I know I won't believe it
They say you can't be found
This man is better off dead
They want to turn your head around
Turn your head around
How can they leave you lying there
Hiding from the lights
They don't know and they couldn't care
They'll be dead by tonight
Someone's made a big mistake
I can't believe my ears
Just how long will this thing take
Give him days, months and years
They took the oath of allegiance
Responsible and proud
Sold their soul for native love
In war to stand their ground
Don't bury the hatchet
Get on with your fight
Snipe down the enemies
Put them out of action
Don't look back
The promised words we never forget
Capture the flag
Capture the flag
Departure to conquest the Hamburger Hill
At the risk of our life
Embitters resistance, deadly traps
Rapid fire
Got no chance to dive
Don't bury the hatchet
Get on with your fight
Snipe down the enemies
Put them out of action
Don't look back
The promised words we never forget
Capture the flag
Capture the flag
Hollow bangs and cries of pain
That filled the air with blood
Fleeing in the minefield reign
Encircled by the flank attacks
A game like Russian roulette
Who will survive?
The mine barrier in front of us
Overpowered in running fight
Armour-piercing bullets
Slaughtered one by one
Two find a way to hide
The tables are turned
By hopeless defeats
Got the power, got the might
Don't bury the hatchet
Get on with your fight
Snipe down the enemies
Put them out of action
Don't look back
The promised words we never forget
Capture the flag
Now twenty years later
Sitting by the beer
Remembrance comes awake
Talk about friends
That never came back
Fallen by the war's disgrace
Don't bury the hatchet
Get on with your fight
Snipe down the enemies
Put them out of action
Don't look back
The promised words we never forget
Capture the flag
Blood...
Blood...
Blood...
Far away from native lands
Prevent a war of conquest
Military blockades
Securing the peace
Fighting for aggressor's rest
Beware of this place
The anger is growing again
Your buds lying there
The symptoms are always the same
Concentration of armies
No diplomatic conversation
Belligerents and lack of self control
Interventions by embargoes
There is a crisis brewing
Wanna get the treasure of the soil
Beware of this place
The anger is growing again
Your buds lying there
The symptoms are always the same
Bloodtrails
Effervesced till world war III
Bloodtrails - 
Suicide to kill the enemy
Bloodtrails
No reasons and no common sense
Bloodtrails
Call you to your end
Bloodtrails
We got orders and inner instruction
By bad educations
Corrupt might took possession of our souls
From land to land
To form new generations
Where shadows join hand
With their own living dead rules
Beware of this place
The anger is growing again
Your buds lying there
The symptoms are always the same
Bloodtrails
Effervesced till world war III
Bloodtrails
Suicide to kill the enemy
Bloodtrails
No reasons and no common sense
Bloodtrails
Call you to your end
Secluded by generalities
No eyes saw them before
Exiled and damned from birth till death
Rejected by their parents
Locked up as beasts
No clergy brought their souls to bless
Never ending pain
In the hour of their death
Driven to their tomb
By never healing wounds
Nobody perceived the cries
No famine got appeased
In hospitals of infanticide
Killers camouflaged
As harmless pediatrist
Children found no place to hide
Never ending pain
In the hour of their death
Driven to their tomb
By never healing wounds
Never ending pain
In the hour of their death
Driven to their tomb
By never healing wounds
With excrements soiled bodies
Starved by malnutrition
Whooping cough and AIDS disease
Now the regime is overthrown
Memorials are raised
But hopes to survive will freeze
Never ending pain
In the hour of their death
Driven to their tomb
By never healing wounds
Born to die in a game
Where there is no return
Try to find a pleasant means of death
All your life you have learnt
Tortured by the world till you
Draw your final breath
Terror, hate
Murder, rape
Through your life trying hard
To find out what it means
Those who know all have lost their mind
Through their eyes we can see
That nothing's to obscene
Empty shells, nothing there
Just bodies left behind
Terror, hate
Murder, rape
In this nightmare life time
You're better off dead
Pain and warfare, sex-crime
You're better off dead
Broken dreams devastated
By your will to live
Ruined by malignance and decay
We're betrayed until
There is nothing more to give
Praying for a final peace
To be there in our graves
Terror, hate
Murder, rape
In this nightmare life time
You're better off dead
Pain and warfare, sex-crime
You're better off dead
Terror, hate
Murder, rape
In this nightmare life time
You're better off dead
Pain and warfare, sex-crime
You're better off dead
In this nightmare life time
You're better off dead
Pain and warfare, sex-crime
You're better off dead
Better off dead
Your soul disappears in eyes of blue
With dignity and lonely lust
The moon is shining bright to you
Angels adore your mortal dust
Welcome to the paradise
Great master's hands will rise
To bring you to the holy place
Eternal life for a human race
Resurrection
Flesh to your bones
Everlasting fortune
You are born
Resurrection
With flowers of gold
Give credence to heaven
Believe in god
Your spirit was willing but your flesh was weak
Don't wanna leave the world of lies
They're standing around when you go to sleep
And give you no chance to say goodbye

To bring you to the holy place
Eternal life for a human race

Source and seed of misanthropy
Is the age of inquisition
Where kings and queens got the power
To lay down immoral religions
Pursuit of innocent flesh
Shredding of their blood
Plundering and robbing
A thousand natural lusts
Hypnotised by the smell of death
Stiff walking to the stake
Amusement, tar and feathers
You are gonna loose your faith
Delivered from the hell's great fear
Spirits lost in gloom
Seek them in their dread abode
Tarred and feathered
Beautiful red-haired ladies
They got put in the pillory
Skinned alive or stoned to death
Broken on the wheel
Sanguinary with arms across
The king watched the scenery
Exorcised and quartered
In the shambles of sin
Hypnotised by the smell of death
Stiff walking to the stake
Amusement, tar and feathers
You are gonna loose your faith
Delivered from the hell's great fear
Spirits lost in gloom
Seek them in their dread abode
Tarred and feathered
Hypnotised by the smell of death
Stiff walking to the stake
Amusement, tar and feathers
You are gonna loose your faith
Delivered from the hell's great fear
Spirits lost in gloom
Seek them in their dread abode
Tarred and feathered
Declaration of war by a madman
Offensive in blizzards and fog
Opening of the conflagration
Thrust to the hostile front
Snowed up Russian winter
There's nothing shining bright
Resistance in December
Against the deadly light
Carry the war into the enemy's camp
Vomiting fire - Infernal thunder
Pugnacity and national defense
Grim struggles hand to hand
Curtain of fire at the frontline
Capitulation and retreat out of this land
Snowed up Russian winter
There's nothing shining bright
Resistance in December
Against the deadly light
Carry the war into the enemy's camp
Vomiting fire
Infernal thunder
Carry the war into the enemy's camp
Vomiting fire
Infernal thunder
Arisen through their own fault by assumption of power
The end is immediately near
Red army struck back in triumphant advance
Madman lost the war and disappeared
Snow covered Russian winter
There's nothing shining bright
Resistance in December
Against the deadly light
Business of false doctrine
Nothing is impossible
They curse the day
When I was born
Mentally deranged
Fits of raving madness
Immolate beyond the grave
Celebrate and enjoy
The thrusts with my knife
The way you feel
Is the way you will die
You think you're dead
But you're just skinned alive
I hear you cry
But slow and sure
Your skin will be my toy
Death becomes
Second nature to me
My heart expands with joy
Celebrate and enjoy
The thrusts with my knife
The way you feel
Is the way you will die
You think you're dead
But you're just skinned alive
Liquidation and supreme sacrifice
Deeply afflicted faces
Appetising body odour
Anguish but rest in pieces
Celebrate and enjoy
The thrusts with my knife
The way you feel
Is the way you will die
You think you're dead
But you're just skinned alive
At the back of beyond
Where time stands still
In a paradise of love and hate
Like pack of hounds
Invading the land
Girls sell their bodies
Like hot cakes
Unscrupulous deals
With human flesh
To live the life of Riley
Behaving like bulls
In a China chop
Pots of money but nothing to pay
One step over the line
Diseased by genital desire
One step over the line
Out of the frying pan
And into the fire
Perverse bents
Clever camouflage
Holidays of infanticide
Mistress of lust
Sold down the river
Exploited and eaten alive
One step over the line
Diseased by genital desire
One step over the line
Out of the frying pan
And into the fire
Once bitten twice shy
She takes you for a ride
The money she needs to survive
Death defying
Sexual act
Welcome to the club where you die
Euthanasia or amnesty
Takes you off the ground
Embrace your hopes
And pray to them
When your smile turns upside down
Silent noise in sleepless nights
Freeze your mind and blood
Think about your morbid life
Is there any god?
No postponement
Death by the law
At zero hour
Stops your beating heart
Your days are numbered
Your fate is sealed
When the bell rings twelve o'clock
Waiting for the message
No governor's reprieve
These guys just doing their job
No postponement
Death by the law
At zero hour
Stops your beating heart
You have to live on charity
Not die a natural death
That brings your life so close
Of your own wrongful act
Come on man
It's time to go
Deliverance not so far
TV covered
Millions wait
Tonight you are the star
Exploitation of young
Consumer groups
Inspired to say yes
Debasement by
Your mad persuasion
Destroyed while you progress
Bullet in the head
Kick the bucket
Are you prepared?
There is a bullet in your head
To stop the way
You earn your bread
Cold blooded and mendacious
Selling of illusions
Ferocious without remorse
You give them a trip
Like there is no tomorrow
Don't care what H. will cause
Bullet in the head
Kick the bucket
Are you prepared?
There is a bullet in your head
To stop the way
You earn your bread
Suffer the children
Coming to me
Enjoy the habit
The first is free
The best you can get
Between heaven and earth
Nothing ventured
Nothing gained
Bullet in the head
Kick the bucket
Are you prepared?
There is a bullet in your head
To stop the way
You earn your bread
Don't believe in rights
There is no such thing
Tearing up the garbage
With pain and suffering
Breaking rules is your desire
You got no sympathy
I'll put you in a wheelchair
That's your penalty
Nothing is secure
Nowhere is safe
Once you cross the line
I will break your spine
The crippler
Broadcast violence
The crippler
Prime time gladiator
The crippler
Bloodsport champion
The crippler
He will take you down
Shattering your kneecaps
The crowd begins to roar
They want more violence
This is a bloody war
Nothing is secure
Nowhere is safe
Once you cross the line
I will break your spine
The crippler
Broadcast violence
The crippler
Prime time gladiator
The crippler
Bloodsport champion
The crippler
He will take you down
Mutilated bodies
Crying out in vain
I will get the trophies
They will not regain
Once you cross the line
I will break your spine
The crippler
Broadcast violence
The crippler
Prime time gladiator
The crippler
Bloodsport champion
The crippler
He will take you down
Adrenaline is pumping
Better you than me
I'm gonna make you bleed
I like brutality
The crippler
Broadcast violence
The crippler
Prime time gladiator
The crippler
Bloodsport champion
The crippler
He will take you down
The crippler
Kicks to the genital
The crippler
Bigfoot in your face
The crippler
Pulling off your fingernails
The crippler
There is no better place
Armed and ready I sit in a room
Vanishing power
A sting in my arm
Blood pours on the floor
Final hour
The one that got me out of the grave
Always there
Don't know what he's aiming at
Do not dare
Never regain...
Tapping the vein
Darkness all around me
I can't see
A door that's never really open
Not for me
The shock of recognition now
I will die
Mind distortion weird thoughts
Tell me why...
I'm going insane...
Tapping the vein
Still got my gun my only friend
Through it all
Can't pull the trigger no final shot
Can't you hear my call?
Venomous poison lethal liquid
Pumping through my veins
Physical destruction
Psychic interruption
Dying brain
Never regain...
Tapping the vein
The end of armistice
And universal peace
No suspension
Of hostilities
Prophecy of bad news
This is no fun
Come into your own
And take off your gun
The enemy behind
Like an awful drag
You'd better have eyes
In the back of your head
Move into position
Put up a good fight
Don't forget the sleeping pills
A kind of suicide
Forget the rules
Forget the odds
Protect your own
War is guts
Back to war
You will be wrapped up
In your assiduous work
Offer your service
To clean up the world
The hostile scum
If looks could kill
Contact with the enemy
That you will feel
Centered on you
Touch and go
Put up with the pain
Await the blow
Fix them for what
They've done to you
Don't fall into line
Don't care what you do
Forget the rules
Forget the odds
Protect your own
War is guts
Back to war
War of independence
Don't beat a retreat
Combative in
The seasoned league
You are sure
Of your success
Never shut the eyes
To the horrible facts
Revolution and cowardice
To get the might
Never let them
Out of your sight
When you fall on the field
They'll bring you home
To the peaceful place
Where you were born
Forget the rules
Forget the odds
Protect your own
War is guts
Back to war
I was granted no quarter
Because you forgot the rules
The words I said are
Sure to come true
Your empty promises
Treacherous and blind
Your deceitful lies call
The war back to my mind
I learnt a way to survive
The enemy to neutralise
They got no reason
Hunting season
I want to set the world on fire
Like a savage beast
A final desire
I burn my boats surrounded by danger
A soldier in hiding kicked out like a stranger
I learnt a way to survive
The enemy to neutralise
They got no reason
Hunting season
I avail every chance
It's a pleasure for me
To slay one by one
To fight for liberty
Once a lieutenant in higher service
Now I'm nothing
A man without mercy
I learnt a way to survive
The enemy to neutralise
They got no reason
Hunting season
I want to set the world on fire
Like a savage beast
A final desire
I burn my boats surrounded by danger
A soldier in hiding kicked out like a stranger
I learnt a way to survive
The enemy to neutralise
They got no reason
Hunting season
Life on earth for you to know
In peace you live in peace you will go
Behind the scenes of salvation
Nobody knows lust and temptation
The mass begins the spirit appears
The man in black nothing he fears
A fatal disguise is what you call holy
Where is god? I want you to show me.
In the name of the father the son
The holy spirit the show has begun
Thy kingdom come thy will be done
Hallowed be thy name
Reincarnation
False celebration
Reincarnation
Mental subordination
Go down on your knees
And pray for peace
Join the club of total devotion
Religious faith and social failure
Once you've been trapped
Death is your saviour
In the name of the father the son
The holy spirit the show has begun
Thy kingdom come thy will be done
Hallowed be thy name
Reincarnation
False celebration
Reincarnation
Mental subordination
In the name of the father the son
The holy spirit the show has begun
Thy kingdom come thy will be done
Hallowed be thy name
Reincarnation
False celebration
Reincarnation
Mental subordination
The first time I've tasted blood
Saw the wide spread dying off
Incurable diseased and on the loose
Remember the atrocities
Stop the painful miseries
Waiting for the dead man's shoes
I need at last your private parts
To satisfy my fucking pride
Magnitude of my oppression
Without pity and compassion
No tenderness within my heart
From the cradle to the grave
A brand of wickedness
Nobody tried to shift my ground
I need at last your private parts
To satisfy my fucking pride
Sodomised, 
Sodomised
When I look into your face
I want you to deflorate
My heart fulfilled with love
Embodiment of my desire
To find your never ending fire
Agony form above
I need at last your private parts
To satisfy my fucking pride
Sodomised, 
Sodomised
Decades of a hundred misconducts
Ain't got no chance to live
A life of intercourse and lust
My eyes reborn of pleasure
Firing squads, cursed forever
Sleep of the just
I need at last your private parts
To satisfy my fucking pride
Sodomised, 
Sodomised
Often you wake up by nocturnal emissions
But you feel no pleasure, no real satisfaction
Dreams mislead you with blanishment
You can't spend it on sweets or touch it, my friend
They divide you for yourself pollution
Have a hard-on for yourself and your bad illusions
Proceed to action with a snatch to crawl
You know you have to do it now
You consider your obnoxious misdeeds
Get a kick out of fruits you would like to greed
A place of joy, put yourself out of misery
A one night stand for the sake of variety
A vaginal victim, unable to resist
Discover your ass sweep off your feet
Don't hink twice and jump at the chance
Don't harass yourself, screw for deliverance
Abuse
A sudden inspiration, a feeling so strong
Close about me to ride for a fall
My time is passing, my chance is getting low
Incredible hate my cure for tomorrow
I can't forget the day you tapped my vein
You said it's my problem and mine alone
You drew the curtain over me
I heard you laughing when you were gone
Ruled by insanity
Degenerate
I'm coming from behind
The only way
Deprivation of my courage to face life
Displaced by war neurosis
I'll struggle to my feet and fight
Devote my gun to its proper purpose
I can't forget the day you tapped my vein
You said it's my problem and mine alone
You drew the curtain over me
I heard you laughing when you were gone
Ruled by insanity
Degenerate
I'm coming from behind
The only way
Under suspicion
You'll not escape
Be prepared for the worst
No matter where you hide
You'll come into my sight
You'll get what you deserve!
I'm waiting for the day we meet again
Enraged and full of anger
My rifled barrel shotgun
Say goodbye because I'm your saviour
I can't forget the day you tapped my vein
Now it's your problem and yours alone
I draw the curtain over you
You hear me laughing when I go
Ruled by insanity
Degenerate
I'm coming from behind
The only way
Under suspicion
You'll not escape
Be prepared for the worst
No matter where you hide
You'll come into my sight
You'll get what you deserve!
Say your little prayer to god every day
And you will not burn in hell
You think the way you live you life is right
But I think it is not
Your mind's fucked up by serving
Some one you don't know
You don't if it's real
If you really wanna bop then find
Some one and bop until the end of time
Say your prayers to god every day
And you all will burn in hell
The lies they tell you won't come true
And in the end you simply die
Fear neither men nor fates
No laughter of the folk
No power of the heaven
Desolation of the earth
Worship blood and fire
Worship swords and spears
Damn them who have pity
Kill them who have tears
Delight in slaying
Find ecstasy in vengeance
The joy of life and death
Raise yourself in pride
With courage and success
Pity not the fallen
You have never known
These evil ones shall cast away
Strike down them hard and low
Delight in slaying
Delight
Despise also the cowards
The liars and the fools
They are the slaves that perish
They are the stupid brood
Delight in slaying
Delight in slaying
I am the god of war
Supreme and terrible one
My judgements true and righteous
Mourning will come
I am the flame that burns
In every heart of man
Revealed are all the secrets
Reborn are all the saints
Delight in slaying
Delight
Under the seal of secrecy
Nobody will come to know the truth
Inpore with impeccability
Heinous deeds coming soon
Freaks of nature
Push matters to extreme
Freaks of nature
Resolute to defeat
Shady and envenomed
Feeble human monsters
Born to be exhibits
Deplorable strangeness
Devoted and obedient
For fear of being whipped
In a state of negativity
There is no retreat
Freaks of nature
Push matters to extreme
Freaks of nature
Resolute to defeat
They abuse before their master
The freak show can begin
Their sun is set they have to suffer
Death is deliverance
Thirst for revenge they flock together
With clubs, knives and all their weapons
To fight for rights and dignity
Slave driver is killed the freaks are freed
Freaks of nature
Push matters to extreme
Freaks of nature
Resolute to defeat
Freaks of nature
Push matters to extreme
Freaks of nature
Resolute to defeat
Raging generals, serious games
They don't know what is really going on
Like a clever move in a game of chess
To make an enemy of the world
They stick at nothing
You better give yourself up
Can't stop to see you suffering
Time for your blood to spill
Unbury the hatchet
Kick the mighty from their seats
Unbury the hatchet
And exalt them of low degree
Wartime comrades, sure of victory
With the threat of an air attack
To strike down the despotical tyrant
Who measures his strength with god
They stick at nothing
You better give yourself up
Can't stop to see you suffering
Time for your blood to spill
Unbury the hatchet
Kick the mighty from their seats
Unbury the hatchet
And exalt them of low degree
Unbury the hatchet
Kick the mighty from their seats
Unbury the hatchet
And exalt them of low degree
Stirred up aggression
We'll not be defeated
It's hard enough for me to say
According to martial law
We shot them down
There will be hell to pay
Unbury the hatchet
Kick the mighty from their seats
Unbury the hatchet
And exalt them of low degree
Unbury the hatchet
Unbury the hatchet
There will be hell to pay
Wars are raging
Under their command
Like a locust plague
Descends upon the land
Sanguinary breeding bad blood
Silent mortified
Man eating crowd
Warning of the end
None can hear the sound
On the day when nature strikes back
Into perdition
Destroyed and defiled
As on a proving ground
infected atomised
Polluted world
Fire spreads at lightning speed
Silent mortified
Man eating crowd
Warning of the end
None can hear the sound
On the day when nature strikes back
Into perdition
Exterminations
Dying nations
The multitude
They didn't realise
The day when nature takes revenge
Silent mortified
Man eating crowd
Warning of the end
None can hear the sound
On the day when nature strikes back
Into perdition
Wars were raging
Suffocation
Humanoid serpents
Caused by the wasteland
The day when nature takes revenge
Silent mortified
Man eating crowd
Warning of the end
None can hear the sound
On the day when nature strikes back
Into perdition
She is searching for
A secret love affair
She hopes to find it
On the street
Do not care about the
Words of moralisers
Immaculate conception
Should it be
She can't control her
Abnormal inclination
But she found a congenial fellow
Fellows in misery
Fellows in misery
Rutting suitors are
Standing around
They'll go along with
Whatever she wants
But she prefers a cooch to eat
She likes to feel a butterfly queen
She can't control her
Abnormal inclination
But she found a congenial fellow
Fellows in misery
Fellows in misery
They get down to practice
Their ferocious games
These little ladies are going insane
Taking the chance and feeling so nice
Ecstasy, maltreated bodies brutalised by spite
She can't control her
Abnormal inclination
But she found a congenial fellow
Fellows in misery
Fellows in misery
She can't control her
Abnormal inclination
But she found a congenial fellow
Fellows in misery
Fellows in misery
They want stop to carry on a ruthless exploitation
They want to see him die, blood and despoliation
Rescue operation
A drop in the bucket
Armed and seasoned
But we'll never give up
Hopeless deliverance
We'll fight to the end
Stick at nothing
Because silence is consent
From the depth he rises,
Tracked and harpooned
Compassion in his eyes,
Death is coming soon
Rescue operation
A drop in the bucket
Armed and seasoned
But we'll never give up
Hopeless deliverance

Armed and seasoned
But we'll never give up
Hopeless deliverance
We'll fight to the end
Stick at nothing

Mysterious voices like setting up a wail
Songs of pain and sorrow that sounds from far away
Murderous, predatory, scrupulous, SCUM
Rescue operation
A drop in the bucket
Armed and seasoned
But we'll never give up
Hopeless deliverance
We'll fight to the end
Stick at nothing

Good-natured giants
The masters of the sea
Telling us a story
The faith of Moby Dick
Precursors of the menace
Admonition of the death
Obscurity and secret force
What are these symbols standing for?
Gomorrah, mother of harlotry
Gomorrah, ascendancy forever
An insidious looking creature
Beneath the frantic fault
Ready to be delivered
The son of our lord
Gomorrah, abomination of the earth
Gomorrah, wrath and fornication
He is crying with a resentful voice
Like a roaring lion
Sin city will burn he has no choice
They have to pay the price
Gomorrah, noisome grievous sore
Gomorrah, judgement of the whore
And their dead bodies
Shall lie in the streets
Where also our lord
Was crucified and killed
Gomorrah, downfall is near
Gomorrah, they didn't realise
Gomorrah, the have to disappear
Gomorrah, blessed are the dead
Living, running
Out on the streets at night
Searching, hoping
For the right connection because I
Need it, want it
You know I've got to have it
Takes me higher
Than anything I know
Angeldust
Need a shot to see me through the day
Angeldust
Want a lot I've got to get away
I live my life
Like there is no tomorrow
Take no chances
I'm drowning
All my sorrows because I
Need it, want it
You know I've got to have
Takes me higher
Than anything I know
Angeldust
Need a shot
To see me through the day
Angeldust
Want a lot I've got to get away
I've got to go
Laughing, crying
Every night and day
I know
You know
That I'm a different man because I
Need it, want it
You know I've got to have
Takes me higher
Than anything I know
Angeldust
Need a shot to see me through the day
Angeldust
Want a lot I've got to get away
Flames of red they escape the fire
The battle rages on, violation of minds
Wiped out everyone who will stand in their path
Replacing the life by the foul stench of death
Corpses of the wicked
Wide-spreading grief and terror
The sacred rise above
Seeking to the ground
Deadringers, warmongers, hypochrists
Masquerade in blood
Like a new-born that squalls as it takes the first breath
He cries to the war because he ain't got no brain
Mounted on horseback the devil in man
This white livered general, this killing friend
Corpses of the wicked
Wide-spreading grief and terror
The sacred rise above
Seeking to the ground
Deadringers, warmongers, hypochrists
Masquerade in blood
With brutal destruction they scatter their bombs
Don't care about children who'll scream and burn
The shadows of murderer will cover the light
Producing the face that nevermore smile
Corpses of the wicked
Wide-spreading grief and terror
The sacred rise above
Seeking to the ground
Deadringers, warmongers, hypochrists
Masquerade in blood
This vulture will desecrated
By arrogance and deadly hatred
Their names are standing for the wrong direction
In a time when god gives no more protection
Corpses of the wicked
Wide-spreading grief and terror
The sacred rise above
Seeking to the ground
Deadringers, warmongers, hypochrists
Masquerade in blood
You try to fly with broken wings
You take off high to avoid the death
Gathering of minds
Gathering of minds
Diseased thoughts, you get scared
Declining years, nuclearised
Gathering of minds
Gathering of minds
Put up a fierce resistance
To the slow decay in you
When you fall into the black hole
Your body and your soul
Vitalities are atrophied
Hopes that fade away
Worthless gets your life
Like driving up foliage
Gathering of minds
Gathering of minds
You go your way, you are not alone
And ending is your thorny road
Living spaces, contaminated
By all the fatal scrap
They'll coming down, materialised
Enchanted by the grace of god
They'll keep their eyes on you
To turn around the fool
Separate the chaft from the wheat
To save you from decease
Escapism, the end of the road
Last judgement's last decree
Lost games, wrong aims
Blue planet only leased
They'll keep their eyes on you
To turn around the fool
Separate the chaft from the wheat
To save you from decease
Falling on the fields of honour
Falling on the fields of honour
Betrayed souls, ruined lives
Common graves, eradication
Waiting for the end of time
In the battle of annihilation
They'll keep their eyes on you
To turn around the fool
Separate the chaft from the wheat
To save you from decease
Falling on the fields of honour
Falling on the fields of honour
Living spaces, deserted
You've lost the chance you've got
Human race, transiency
A thing of the past
They'll keep their eyes on you
To turn around the fool
Separate the chaft from the wheat
To save you from decease
Falling on the fields of honour
A fateful day when you lost your mind
Pulsing blood but tour body won't die
They hold up the mirror to your face
New definitions to the human race
Preaching charity and mind over matter
Profit by your misadventure
Are you passed away when your lungs are breathing
Time to go when your heart is still beating
Braindead
Conditioned by vivisection
Cannibalised, no resurrection
Butchers covered by snow-white coats
To save your life and morbid thoughts
Acceptance by forerunners of hell
They know how to do and they do it well
To suppress the lies and all the facts
The truth about your final breath
Braindead
Braindead
A fateful day when you lost your mind
Pulsing blood but tour body won't die
They hold up the mirror to your face
New definitions to the human race
Preaching charity and mind over matter
Profit by your misadventure
Are you passed away when your lungs are breathing
Time to go when your heart is still beating
Braindead
I saw your face in the crowd
Impressed so deep inside my heart
Nothing gonna stop me now
Seduce this little whore
Your soul was dipped in venom
Your dignity with angel's words
Sweetness of your dirty love
That makes me feel so good
Refracting the light of my dreams
Darkening the sun of my hopes
Like silhouette of dissimulation
Like a shadow of damnation
Riding on a train I cannot control
Through all the pain, through all the sorrow
It's just the passion I demand
It's just the road that never ends
Refracting the light of my dreams
Darkening the sun of my hopes
Like silhouette of dissimulation
Like a shadow of damnation
You are acting on your playground
To see me creep and crawl
God-awful my dependence
Upon this greedy soul
Lacerated by your passion
The devil seems to be with you
Secret wishes, satisfaction
Emotions of a fool
Refracting the light of my dreams
Darkening the sun of my hopes
Like silhouette of dissimulation
Like a shadow of damnation
Like a shadow of damnation
Don't be afraid of any man
No matter what his size
Just call on me, I will be there
And I will equalise
Peacemaker's law
Thumb-buster's draw
Peacemaker's law
A bad boys war
Don't shoot a man into his back
Ignore his warning signs
Give him a chance to turn around
Maybe you will decide
Peacemaker's law
Thumb-buster's draw
Peacemaker's law
A bad boys war
Never face the fact that you
Throw down the gauntlet to me
Your persuasion I don't care
My sight gives you the creep
Peacemaker's law
Thumb-buster's draw
Peacemaker's law
A bad boys war
I'm not afraid of you my friend
No matter what your size
Just call to him in time of need
And he will equalise
Peacemaker's law
Thumb-buster's draw
Peacemaker's law
A bad boys war
Peacemaker's law
Peacemaker's law
Give me a sign that you exist
At the threshold of entrance
I'm filled with hopes and yearning
To find a way beyond the death
Condemned to leave this awful world
Don't try to stop me I'm resolute
To commit suicide
You'll see the murder in my eyes
Something whispering in my ears
Come on take my hand
Rising up to the other side
Recovered from the bad
Condemned to leave this awful world
Don't try to stop me I'm resolute
To commit suicide
You'll see the murder in my eyes
Locked up in a hidden room
I have to pay the price
Carried away by the end of the light
Wonderful to die
Condemned to leave this awful world
Don't try to stop me I'm resolute
To commit suicide
You'll see the murder in my eyes
Born in bad relationships
Growing up in gutters to learn the tricks
At daggers drawn with all the laws
Don't know what the rules are for
Unwanted youth
Unwanted youth
Rebellion to society
Searching for a war
Unwanted youth
Unwanted youth
Cowards of the revolution
Burn them to the bone
Just your breathing call up the enemies
To the battleground in dusty streets
If you will get the upper hand
To save your right that you demand
Unwanted youth
Unwanted youth
Rebellion to society
Searching for a war
Unwanted youth
Unwanted youth
Cowards of the revolution
Burn them to the bone
Crime on rise the gun is your toy
Starting to blast you believe in your way
Fighting with your own insanity
Between the devil and the deep sea
Who promised you it would be easy
Just follow me and you will see
The shattered dreams of an intact world
That seems so empty and absurd
Unwanted youth
Unwanted youth
Rebellion to society
Searching for a war

Do you see
All the dreg of humanity
Rank and file
That looks at me
Creeping out of gloomy holes
Like dirty lousy rats
Soiling up this peaceful place
With all their rotten shit
Scum
Scum
Every inch
Misantrophists
Holding in contempt
The dignity of man
Coloured whipping boys
Victimised by their foolish hate
Defenceless like a toy
When they go to their fate
Scum
Marching off
With the flags of lies
Get their ashes hauled
In a dreadful fight
Unscrupulous rapes
Beyond the grave
Embodies ghastly sights
Signed by cowardice
Scum
I'm a powerkeg, ready to explode
Never admit defeat in the last resort
You better run to set you free
Because my bloodlust jerks my mind to kill
Don't search for help under attack
I bite like a dog perfidious like a rat
My eyes are blind, uncertain way to go
No force on earth can stop me now
Infected victims lumbering you way
You go right off the track, nobody escape
Pugnacious like a beast
Confessions in the dark
Hydrophobia
I want to hear your plaintive screams
That sound's so nice in my wildest dreams
I will never separate the sheep from the goats
Just want to see everyone in hell to roast
Infected victims lumbering you way
You go right off the track, nobody escape
Pugnacious like a beast
Confessions in the dark
Hydrophobia
What is the use of your cry for help
Nobody hears the screams when you get scared
I can't explain how good it feels
But the day will come when I have to leave
Infected victims lumbering you way
You go right off the track, nobody escape
Pugnacious like a beast
Confessions in the dark
Hydrophobia
I'm goin' out on the streets and I'm feelin' fine
But if you wanna fight me and I don't know why
Yeah I wanna get dirty all covered in mud
But you turn on me all I see is blood
Let's Break the Law here tonight
They wanna lock me up and throw away my key
I'm out with my lads and I'm feelin' mean
Well we ain't that good and we ain't that clean
We don't really care if you're black or white
But we'll do it now until it's light
Let's Break the Law here tonight
They wanna lock me up and throw away my key
Let's break the law tonight
We're givin' the law tonight
We'll settle the score tonight
Let's Break the Law here tonight
They wanna lock me up and throw away my key
I'm goin' out on the streets and I'm feelin' fine
But if you wanna fight me and I don't know why
Yeah I wanna get dirty all covered in mud
But you turn on me all I see is blood
Let's Break the Law here tonight
They wanna lock me up and throw away my key
Sexual urge
Unleashed energy
Repressed for so many years
No more continence
Dreams of smashing
Let ablaze this dark abyss
The fruits of my life
So fully developed
Burned up to a crisp
Hatred turns to apathy
But now the beggar changed into a king
I cannot hear the frozen screams
My mind feels so much flattered
I taste the blood so warm and sweet
A mournful desirous charade
Playing with my sensual toy
I see it down below
My fingers touched the creature's neck
Seduced me to move on
My plans get true without repent
For whom I shed a tear?
You have to pay the righteous price
until I get jailed again
Tides of burning blood upon my face
Caressing my soul like a sweet embrace
Passionate, secret and profound
Gleaming eyes of uncharitable love
Shuffling out of mental claws to find a resort
Champagne of desire still oozing from my pores
I cannot resist the guileful brightness in your eyes
And your body with limbs that drags behind
Affectionated wantoness so give me your hand
Never weeping over victims never feeling bad
Inflaming the wish to control your breath
Sequestration from life, conveyance to death
I know that I am guilty but devoutness diarized
God-awful desecration, psychotic homicide
Discovered is my preference for lacerated skin
I hope that rotten bodies don't get buried so deep
That's what an unknown killer diarized
My spirit is casting the pure part of the one
Who brings fatal calamites still before the dawn
I never before felt a kind of compunction
My life is inspired by endless temptation
The day when I'm snatched away from this ground
And veins are exhausted by my bleeding heart
I consider to reap now the fruits of death
Retire with pride to write down my adventures
She followed me trustfully
But wondered where we'd go
I led her to the hidden place
That she had never seen before
My sweet heart
This is the hour of the savage guns
Beyond the pale and beyond the sun
Ganged up with jesse by the mating call of gold
Side by side fighting not changing the course
The code of law in the hand of the one
Who drags you to the hanging tree
Bloodhounds in the hands of those
Who will have to bleed
Haging judge
He is the law
Hanging judge
You are in his claws
Hanging judge
The trapdoor will fall
Hanging judge
Bullets for breakfast and dust to breathe
To be on the point to strike down all the wimps
Killing the riders of the whistling pine
By each wardrum beat someone will die
The wild bunch riding wings of hawks
Red painted deserts where you broke the law
Your facedown life ain't so much of a pity
Against the fools and against the glory
Your touch is like a snakebite kiss
Your love is like a boon
A leader in my haggard dreams
Emotions of a fool
No way out
I'm spoiling you with my prurience
My sadness disappears
The way you told me beside stories
Still pleasant to my ears
A willing and addictive girl
Wide open legs so tempting
The gleeming of her greedy eyes
Seduced me to come back
Your touch was like a snakebite kiss
Your love was like a boon
The leader in my haggard dreams
He passes me the gun
I'm quite prepared to use what everyone declines
I can't restrained myself
'cause devils in my head tonight
Dullness in my eyes turns all the sunshine into rain
And I deceive myself that I could never fall again
I'm a polytoximaniac
Dangerous and blind
A polytoximaniac
The truth begins to bite
A polytoximaniac
It's all that I can say
A polytoximaniac
From birth 'til my decay
It's not a strong man's act to fall in ecstasy
I like to have a bit of fun also with medicine
I blow my brain out of my head but I don't care
Searching for a secret flavour restless day by day
Sometimes I see reflections in the shade of god
One billion cockroaches are ready to attack
I can't believe my sense it's time to sat goodbye
The golden shot is due, erasure of my mind
I feel a rifle bullet bore into my heart
A sudden impact shock that stops my pulsing blood
I see the glory shining light of paradise
And insincerities, forever left behind
until death do us unite
I see the mournful flowers fading on my grave
And all my friends are crying to god my soul to save
Hateful faces spitting on my last resting place
And all my foes are praying to hell my mind to take
I hear the echos of your prayers and your lies
Your falseness and your greed mendacious sorry sights
My hopes are buried by my broken dignity
Still god will bless and curse us all
To all eternity
Time,
Time,
Time, see what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities.
I was so hard to please.
Look around,
Leaves are brown,
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter.
Hear the salvation army band.
Down by the riverside's
Bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned.
Carry your cup in your hand.
And look around.
Leaves are brown.
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter.
Hang on to your hopes, my friend.
That's an easy thing to say,
But if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend that you can build the m again.
Look around,
The grass is high,
The fields are ripe,
It's the springtime of my life.
Seasons change with the scenery;
Weaving time in a tapestry.
Won't you stop and remember me
At any convenient time?
Funny how my memory skips
Looking over manuscripts
Of unpublished rhyme.
Drinking my vodka and lime,
I look around,
Leaves are brown,
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter.
Show them that you are the master of carnal desire
Confusion in their hateful eyes when they call you a liar
You cannot suppress the reflection of hate and rebirth
With all your strength of you will to escape from this earth
Suicidal justice
Collective instinct of death
Suicidal justice
A war of a man life to waste
This will be the first and the last act inside of your mind
It's useless to save yourself and don't try to hide
You got a message to kill from a higher place
The horrors of war switched off your brain
Take revenge!
You see them on hands and on knees when they crawl from their holes
You've never before seen a life fading so slow this is the time to go
Come on kiss the ground castration of cowards
And feeding the balls to the hounds
On your knees
Praying at the burial ground
Mistrustful eyes of intimacy
Pointing the way to the other side
You hear the screams of a million souls
Unguarded and left to their own resources
Where time turned into a frozen block
And even the water of life
You will die!
Wander in the valley
As you reach for the sky
With hollow shells of faded dreams
Time bomb ticking has just begun
To make reprisals on what I have done
Like grains of sand that fall from my hand
The fate I feel is drawing near
Shackles in my brain losing so fast
Waiting to unfold
Mummified bodies
Elixir of life wasting away
Perpetual glares of those who are delivered
Entomber in the derbis of honour and blood
A sinful voice that prophesied
Death becomes easy just close your eyes
Incantation of freedom so urgent and true
Your wish is my command
Incubation of a mental disease
Transpiration of a spiteful liquid
Coming to terms with the devil
Threatening like the reaper in a saddle
You sow the seeds of discord
You'll reap the fruits of death
He learned to dominate the gamesmanship of war
An outrage, cynic for use all
You are a rusty nail in our coffin
The world's reminding exibition
One man's meat is another ones poison
So kill yourself with tears of joy
We'll never accept to bite the dist like this
Got a mighty weapon to defend us
Unnatural caresses of a man without remorse
He didn't realize the fact that love can't be commanded
Confusion and depravity, rituals of death
Memories linger in his brain; dreams in a bed of nails
Possessed by all the souvenirs
Possessed by crying children
Spreading madness kile disease
Near death experience
Master of disguise
A dirty smile is integrate into killer's face
Bloodshot eyes stare resolutely, watch the victim's race
Welcome to the surgery; hearts will be removed
Raping to find satisfaction; posing like a dog
Hidden deep inside
When the flame of life grows cold and every lie is true
Ride the wings of sacrifice but never play the fool
Incarnation of the evil one; crushing skulls and bones
You don't belong to the human race
No mercy for your soul
Belonging to an alliance
For better or for worse
Disloyalty gets punished
If you tear down the wall
Your strength of will, built on sand
Pootprints on your face
No dream and no reality
Will save you from yourself
No dream and no reality
Will save you from yourself
Code Red...
Discriminated without permission
Against the chosed one
Who was your bother hand in hand
When the war began
Infecting total facism
To a crawling wimp
They let you run the gauntlet
And worship their defeat
They let you run the gauntlet
And worship their defeat
Code Red...
Exasperated defamations
Barbarian rebirth
Mobilized the inner beast
Indulge your natural curse
Reclaiming of your dignity
Privacy lost in cries
Unheard, pounding screams of hate
At the wall of lies
Unheard, pounding screams of hate
At the wall of lies
Code Red...
Insatiable lust for murder
Greedy for desire
No sorrow stops my inclination
An inner burning fire
The war within my pulsing brain
Keeps me separated
From those who never understand
Blind and desecrated
Red eyes are watching you
Immaculated cruel
You earn what you desever
No chance for your rebirth
It's just a battleground
For dissapointed hounds
My scorn will be your fate
That's what hell can create
The laughter of the useless man
Seems to me like promises
I raped and loved with silent pleasure
Not just in fantasies
I know there's nothing I can do
To kill the beast of thunder
They fed me with their inspirations
Escort me to the abbatoir
Red eyes are watching you
Immaculated cruel
You earn what you desever
No chance for your rebirth
It's just a battleground
For dissapointed hounds
My scorn will be your fate
That's what hell can create
Stripped of all my dignity
Thoughts of suicide
No conscience and no regret
Anger form the skies
The wall of silence starts to fall
I'm gonna go with pride
Piece by piece the truth reborn
Death to my delight
Red eyes are watching you
Immaculated cruel
You earn what you desever
No chance for your rebirth
It's just a battleground
For dissapointed hounds
My scorn will be your fate
That's what hell can create
In the desert plains
They ride
Two faced killers on the battle line
No defeat
One kind deed
And bullets to your brain
Here they wanna go to sleep
To wait the coming morrow
Looking for a lucky strike
Everlasting sorrow
Hearts of granite, eyes of steel
No faith appear to be within
Following the promised land
Unmerciless and grim
Tombstone
The good, the bad, and the ugly
Martial law
Covered up
Return good for evil
The cowboy conspiracy
Will find a wicked end
Meeting on the battleground
Under threat of death
Inseminate with hatred
Now the guns decide
Who broke the law
Surrender or fight
Tombstone
Blood on the ground
Lead in the air
The war has just begun
Side by side
To kill the dirty bunch
A brother murdered brutal
Ambushing yellow rats
Now they have to pay the price
Selected for revenge
Malicious and blind
No use to hide no place to run
Wendetta burns inside
Until his work is done
Tombstone
They penetrate your skin
No more vitalities
Feeding your mind with fear
Smell of death is coming near
Squeezing out your blood
Life dragging through the mud
Dissection of your brain
Pumpin' up the lead
The suffocate my flame of life
Ceremonial desecration
Death is now so close to me
Liquidation
The sound of ripping fleash
No chance for your defense
Languishing hungry guns
Return the hellish sacred flame
Unyielding hateful wrath
No confidence in god
Another breed behind
They'll leave you where the others lie
The suffocate my flame of life
Ceremonial desecration
Death is now so close to me
Liquidation
Incapability
Escape your destiny
The rhythm of your heart
No more salvation to go on
Trapped in an icecold blaze
Your carcass starts to mate
Love finds a graceful end
The devil incarnates
The suffocate my flame of life
Ceremonial desecration
Death is now so close to me
Liquidation
The sons of the night
The god of the light
Escorted by a rolling thunder
There is no grace
There is no guilt
Enflamed by a human wonder
Looking through my eyes
And see the wisdom from above
Execution of my mind
And spiteful symbols all around
Born to be a man
Who has no nature and no name
Can't wait 'til death arise
Spiritual Demise
Lifeless dreams
Racial kings
Absorbing through my eyes
Godlike creatures
False god leaders
Fighting side by side
Looking through my eyes
And see the wisdom from above
Execution of my mind
And spiteful symbols all around
Born to be a man
Who has no nature and no name
Can't wait 'til death arise
Spiritual Demise
Give me the sign that I release
Like words of mystery
Invoking for the breeding madness
Eternal fleshly seed
This hate could fill my perverse heart
Erections now spill blood
This mortal dust that rides the wind
And fire born by sparks
Corrosive sins
Blanched my soul
That hell out of control
With open arms
A peaceful dusk
And satan takes me home
Looking through my eyes
And see the wisdom from above
Execution of my mind
And spiteful symbols all around
Born to be a man
Who has no nature and no name
Can't wait 'til death arise
Spiritual Demise
This hate could fill my perverse heart
Erections now spill blood
This mortal dust that rides the wind
And fire born by sparks
My vacant art just imitate
A vacant nameless life
The knowledge of the victory
With vervent demonized
I'll bring up all my biggest guns
For those who never mind
Submission and duplicity
Don't want to lose my stripes
Warwhoops sounds from far beyond
In duration of my sense
My urges are revealed
The trade of war it makes me tense
Abilities to a man
Not firing a shot
Repentence of my inner soul
Can't help me to forget
Warlike Conspiracy
Nobody hears my inner voice
Imploring to his grace
I turn my servile face to god
But his face was turned away
My comrades diving hand in hand
The bullets struck 'em down
I followed them without a fear
The mating call of war
Warlike Conspiracy
My vacant art just imitate
A vacant nameless life
The knowledge of the victory
My comrades diving hand in hand
The bullets struck 'em down
I followed them without a fear
The mating call of war
I detest the awful day when you was born
Your mind, your soul genetically deformed
The nature struck back with a fatal mistake
In witness whereof what hell can create
The darkside of the mocking curse
Fervent love your pet averse
Thousands blugeoned lifes
Dastardly cowardice
Cowardice
a freezing touch
Cowardice
bloody embrace
Innocent blood adorns your raping hands
Importunity and lewdness systematically planned
Predominant signs that we have to demoan
Are deeply engraved in yourself to go on
The darkside of the mocking curse
Fervent love your pet averse
Thousands blugeoned lifes
Dastardly cowardice
Cowardice
a freezing touch
Cowardice
bloody embrace
The crunch of the dawn
Victims were found
Salvation in their eyes
Instinctive urge
Tremendous search
Deranged and Paralyzed
Virginal flesh
Summon the death
Perception really numb
A horrible man
The beautiful maid
And then your purge is done
Dewey eyed trusting and kissing the rods
Offering hands to the snapping dogs
Praying for god everyday for his scorn
Why didn't your mother get killed before?
The darkside of the mocking curse
Fervent love your pet averse
Thousands blugeoned lifes
Dastardly cowardice
Cowardice
a freezing touch
Cowardice
bloody embrace
Why didn't your mother get killed before?
Bad menace
Bloody taste
Hold him in a vicelike grip
Disordered life
A rabid dog
Blinded by deceit
Abhorrence of the paltry and human remains
Moronic sentiments are born to be expectorated
Immacualted beauties just a kind of blasphemy
And everything that moves is all the energy for him
The vice of killing
His soul was crippled in the past
The vice of killing
No therapy will never last
Unsolicited
Change of heart
Inspired by the gloomy legends
Hemorrhage
Pouring out
Just an absurd gadget
Concentrated
Hungry thoughts
Malevolence incurably fused
Terrified
because the truth
Infested with immoral abuse
Abhorrence of the paltry and human remains
Moronic sentiments are born to be expectorated
Immacualted beauties just a kind of blasphemy
And everything that moves is all the energy for him
The vice of killing
His soul was crippled in the past
The vice of killing
No therapy will never last
Dreadful pain
Passed away
Just watching for another game
Segregated from
Normality
Psychotic morbid brain
Mischievous greeds
Strange desire
Craving for the victim's wine
Feasting on
Their despair
Unheard screams adorn his evil shrine
Abhorrence of the paltry and human remains
Moronic sentiments are born to be expectorated
Immacualted beauties just a kind of blasphemy
And everything that moves is all the energy for him
The vice of killing
His soul was crippled in the past
The vice of killing
No therapy will never last
The malediction of a wicked breed
Total exhibition by political supreme
They look away and keep restrained cause money doesn't smell
Don't wanna hear the cries, forever damned in hell
Mind decapitation
Insane misdeeds without a trace
Nobody sees your smiling face
Visual Buggery
Barbarically electrified by terror and by pain
Consuming the irreverance, enjoyment for the brain
Depravation of a brutish world where death is still refined
Improving the occasion, corroded from inside
Mind decapitation
Insane misdeeds without a trace
Nobody sees your smiling face
Visual Buggery
You lock the doors, still breathing hot
With penchant for decease
Fingers crawling to the place
Where the serpent live
Incinerated feelings, unscrupulously dumped
Fingers crawling to the gun
To seal your morbid fate
Mind decapitation
Insane misdeeds without a trace
Nobody sees your smiling face
Slashing the wantoness, grudging deeds
With hearts that have no right to beat
Whispering echoes forcasting my fate
From heaven to hell I spirit away
The shadow of wathers haunting my soul
Replacing my life for a handful of gold
The slings and the fetters of outrageous foes
Peremptory baseness where glory once shone
Losing the ground at the end of the light
Beheading myself no more power to fight
Horror beyond the unnatural fear
Reflection of lies so threatening near
Apathetic servants of the mighty evil
Rushing demise, blind decision
Exhaustion of my will
Habitual turning
Lifeless objects, peaceful symbols
Book burning
The scriptures of freedom devoured by fire
Flushes of anger immortal desire
Appeal to the gods is ceasing unheard
Lamentations sounded imploring absurd
My rage unleashed and my glare is reborn
Sunshine removed by a cold winterstorm
Deliver me god from this treacherous crowd
These crystal nights bring the life to nought
Losing the ground at the end of the light
Beheading myself no more power to fight
Horror beyond the unnatural fear
Reflection of lies so threatening near
Apathetic servants of the mighty evil
Rushing demise, blind decision
Exhaustion of my will
Habitual turning
Lifeless objects, peaceful symbols
Book burning
Stunted growth of emotions
Incurable confused
Gazing at her reflections
Mentally abused
You kill the one you love
At the first opportunity
Wistful resolution
Carnal property
The wolf and the lamb
Marauding in the night
Unsuspecting bags never pray
The truth a broken spine
And life will never change
The wolf and the lamb
Drifting in sea of blood
Shivered to the bone
Accusing words don't reach my ear
Request for death is done
The wolf and the lamb
I'm just a prowling maverick
And detriment to health
Cutthroat competition
Desultory to myself
Scary vulgarism
Unfathomable cursed
Perpetuate my memories
Incombustible words
Addicted to abstinence
Protruberant intestines
Exhilerated sight
Notorious dinginess
Coming from behind
I put you to the sword
Gasp your vomit out
You'll never reach the shore
Defigured like a scrag
Scary vulgarism
Unfathomable cursed
Perpetuate my memories
Incombustible words
Addicted to abstinence
Protruberant intestines
Exhilerated sight
Notorious dinginess
Coming from behind
I put you to the sword
Gasp your vomit out
You'll never reach the shore
Defigured like a scrag
Scary vulgarism
Unfathomable cursed
Perpetuate my memories
Incombustible words
Heinous and destructive
Balanced on the edge
Rancerously cutting
He's dangerous and sledge
Addicted to abstinence
Seems like dead men want to leave their graves
Point to anything they love to hate
Broken skulls reflection all around
Execution, blood beneath the walls
Aggressive jungle war
Breaking through the lines
Slaughter according to your evil rites
Your death will be methodic
Gonna lose my way
Among the weirdcong
Machine gun fire chain reaction
Shredded brains
Among the weirdcong
Antipathy to the gloating face
Dissection til your soul will leave again
Impact shock absorbs my energy
Bullets cutting through the rotten meat
Aggressive jungle war
Breaking through the lines
Slaughter according to your evil rites
Your death will be methodic
Gonna lose my way
Among the weirdcong
Machine gun fire chain reaction
Shredded brains
Among the weirdcong
Your death will be methodic
Gonna lose my way
Among the weirdcong
Machine gun fire chain reaction
Shredded brains
Among the weirdcong
Emotions died, extinguished deep inside
Impurity made blood turns into wine
When I saw my friends impaled to death
Dishonoured and condemned their strength
Aggressive jungle war
Breaking through the lines
Slaughter according to your evil rites
Your death will be methodic
Gonna lose my way
Among the weirdcong
Machine gun fire chain reaction
Shredded brains
Among the weirdcong...
No emotions to take your life
Confrontation with the dead inside
Wasted thousand centuries
Now fighting for the endless peace
Adrenaline control
Forever fixed my soul
Curse by my side
Judgement in disguise
I am the war
Never disarmed
I am the war
Within my heart
I am the war
Supreme command
I am the war
Living on the edge
I am the war
I smell the rats of mendacity
Napalm for your nudity
I practice what I preach my god
Dehydration of your blood
Adrenaline control
Forever fixed my soul
Curse by my side
Judgement in disguise
I am the war
Never disarmed
I am the war
Within my heart
I am the war
Supreme command
I am the war
Living on the edge
I am the war
I cannot build but I can destroy
Insanity concealed
All the structures have been lost
Totally decease
I am the war
Never disarmed
I am the war
Within my heart
I am the war
Supreme command
I am the war
Living on the edge
Infected by unnatural aggression
Driven by abnormal death selection
No antibodies that fixed my mind
No teardrop dims my savage eyes
Adrenaline control
Forever fixed my soul
Curse by my side
Judgement in disguise
I am the war
Never disarmed
I am the war
Within my heart
I am the war
Supreme command
I am the war
Living on the edge
I am the war
Decease is just an irony of fate
Multiple rites I'm gonna lose my way
Paraphilliac body control
To slay the phantom from my soul
...you're gonna die!
Unholy evil prophets rise
Fire is raining from the endless skies
Can you hear the final thunder roaring
Napalm in the morning
Skin peeling off to drop your timid mask
You wish that death redeems you fast
Creation of the fire seems the perfect nude
Your carbonized torso just a part of you
...you're gonna die!
Unholy evil prophets rise
Fire is raining from the endless skies
Can you hear the final thunder roaring
Napalm in the morning
Charlie close to me
Smell of gasoline
Physically abused
See the hollow face
That burned down and raped
Your petition refused
Screaming for your life
Suffocation cries
Religions been lost
Dancing in the flames
That's your destiny
Surrendered to the gods
Unholy evil prophets rise
Fire is raining from the endless skies
Can you hear the final thunder roaring
Napalm in the morning
...you're gonna die!
Unholy evil prophets rise
Fire is raining from the endless skies
Can you hear the final thunder roaring
Napalm in the morning
Time bomb warrior
Flancked all around
Fighting back their lies
You are my soul insane
Blood stops feeding veins
God damn monkey's bite
Ashes dung the ground
Infuriate mauled
Recrudescence of wounds
There's no time to waste
Smash'em without grace
Hell is coming to you
You know there is a reason
Why you never shouldn't trust
As their fury got released
Undertaking blast
Jumping on a mine
Can't find refuge
Your reign can now begin
Ignoring your triumph
Summon up the dead
Tormenting nightmares
Revealed my darkest fear
Dancing with the devil
See the staring eyes of rage
Violence is just a friend
Walking on the right way
Jumping on a mine
Jumping on a mine
Can't find refuge
Your reign can now begin
Ignoring your triumph
Summon up the dead
Tormenting nightmares
Revealed my darkest fear
Shellshock shades of darkness
Valiant demise
I see my rent remains
because my celebrations still alive
Jumping on a mine
Jumping on a mine
Can't find refuge
Your reign can now begin
Ignoring your triumph
Summon up the dead
Tormenting nightmares
Revealed my darkest fear
This is the dark side of humanity
To liberate treacherous insanity
You can't ignore the truth behind
That followed us until the end of time
You see the stars when the night is done
You see the death when the life is gone
Confused by the rules who'll take control
There is no god
The sacred halls of truth
That bitterness on youth
I heard the whispered tales
Of glory and of death
Of immortality
Into their destiny
We fight the holy fire
While feeding Satan's flames
Genocide
Elimination
Demented minds
Genocide
Extermination
Tortured lives
Sitting on a time bomb with a primitive design
Wish we got the spirit and the power to survive
The final day is close to us the right to live refused
Who gonna wake'em up to kill the multitude
No revolution set us free to break the line
Answers lost before somebody asking why
Just one bullet left for perpetual sleep
Locked up in a cage kicked away the key
The sacred halls of truth
That bitterness on youth
I heard the whispered tales
Of glory and of death
Of immortality
Into their destiny
We fight the holy fire
While feeding Satan's flames
Genocide
Elimination
Demented minds
Genocide
Extermination
Tortured lives
The sacred halls of truth
That bitterness on youth
I heard the whispered tales
Of glory and of death
Of immortality
Into their destiny

While feeding Satan's flames
Genocide
Elimination
Demented minds
Genocide
Extermination
Tortured lives
Mother's little freckled boy
He is the father's pride
A little beauty sweet beloved
The sunshine of their lives
There's something in the air tonight
Little boy
Send greetins to the other side
Little boy
Resting by your teddy's side
Sleeping without guilt
With magic in your mind inside
No war inside your dreams
Gonna see the life below
Little boy
Dead means when you touch the ground
Little boy
No god will pray the world to leave
Little boy
Cause god himself the one who did
Little boy
The truth with dirt in it's face
With bubble in his hair
Innocence of babyhood
Never really care
I let you go, leave me alone
Little boy
My work is done, now it's your turn
Little boy
I can't look back just say good bye
Little boy
Appeared to me so shining bright
Little boy
How many ears need a man
To hear the people cry
How many times a man must look
Before he see the sky
How many years a mountain needs
Before it washed to the sea
How many times some people need
To get allowed to live
Firepower in the hand of a madman
Hell is gonna burn
Crushing them down, pounding away
At the point of no return
Painful screams growing near
Metal cutting your breast
Laughing when you lose control
Pollution guarantee
Creeping and crawling why do you cry?
Pathetically prayers by your side
Caught beneath my blood erection
Lead injection
Assault attack, the rifle's blast
You are my soul insane
A product of a brutal world
Killing just a game
Hatred burns with desolation
Pleasure for the blood
This must be the dead man's day
The truth in crimson mud
Creeping and crawling why do you cry?
Pathetically prayers by your side
Caught beneath my blood erection
Lead injection
Creeping and crawling why do you cry?
Pathetically prayers by your side
Caught beneath my blood erection
Lead injection
Swinging the judgement's hammer down
Glory 'til the end
Now you wish you had a god
Now evil in your brain
Bullets left the gun straight ahead
Awaiting your cancerous breath
Will touch you when you're still alive
And left you when you're dead
Creeping and crawling why do you cry?
Pathetically prayers by your side
Caught beneath my blood erection
Lead injection
Creeping and crawling why do you cry?
Pathetically prayers by your side
Caught beneath my blood erection
Lead injection
I feel like someone's watching me
Don't know where the enemy is
The night brings bad dreams to my mind
Maybe the girl that's by my side
Potential killers extremely mauled
Machine gun fire all around
Into the eye of a hurricane
The ultimate end
I got no power to survive
Empty thoughts of suicide
Psychotic wounds that never heal
You put the crown of thorns on me
Cowards in the grip of fear
A fox the chicken disappear
Creation of the lifeless rules
No return
All my heroes
Fighting legions
Crucified in flames
Cannon fodder
Rivers of red
Russian roulette
Gambling hypocrites
Cannon fodder
No scream will ever intimidate
Upon the dark side of a man
Walk among the bursting grenades
Ghosts of Vietnam penetrate
Burning towns up over there
Teaching freedom death parade
Snipers pointing accurate
Living on the edge
All my heroes
Fighting legions
Crucified in flames
Cannon fodder
Rivers of red
Russian roulette
Gambling hypocrites
Cannon fodder
I feel like someone's watching me

Stalking down the enemy
These haunting memories
The evil men are killing blindly
Erased of human waste
It's frozen in their face
Traumatic minds enslaved
Screams that never reached my ears
Until the death redeems
Ambivalence
Lost salvation
Lunatic fringe
Incarceration
Freedom's slave
Subliminal deceit
Blood, blood on your lips
Measure my faith
Come on to die with me
Blood, blood on your lips
You're falling down
Into a pitiless sleep
My systematic procedure
Within my conscious mind
Can't wash away the crimson stains
No tears that save my eyes
Passion for the flesh
I know that never dies
The devils that surround me
Never asking why
Imagination
Victimized
Obliteration
Justified
All I see
The multitudes of death
Blood, blood on your lips
Measure my faith
Come on to die with me
Blood, blood on your lips
You're falling down
Into a pitiless sleep
Blood
Die with me
Blood
On your lips
I am the chosen one
Your dad and your lovely mum
I'll offer my secrets for you
My physical lust
This is for me and you
Searching to find the truth
No reason for you to cry
We'll find the paradise
Blood on your lips
Ambivalence
Lost salvation
Lunatic fringe
Incarceration
Freedom's slave
Subliminal deceit
Blood, blood on your lips
Measure my faith
Come on to die with me
Blood, blood on your lips
You're falling down
Into a pitiless sleep
Blood
on your lips
Blood
Die with me
Blessed to taste a life of sin
My mind in constant pain
The piece that's always left behind
Just a morbid game
Taking your reverse
Open up your eyes
Your intact world will be destroyed
My short breath is by your side
There's nothing I can do
To stop me now
Wanted dead
The final sacrifice
Wanted dead
To preserve my reign
Who will write my story down
My emptiness to fill
The ocean of my hopeless thoughts
My hand for you to feed
Emotions blazed on fire
Segments of my life
The smile that's on my twisted face
Another sign that lies
There's nothing you could do
To stop me now
Wanted dead
The final sacrifice
Wanted dead
To preserve my reign
It's never been too late
Just to ease the pain
Caught between your legs
Suffering the dead
Reign upon your world
I've never sworn the oath
The secrets kept so long
I'll tell you now
Blessed to taste a life of sin
My mind in constant pain
The piece that's always left behind
It's just a morbid game
Taking your reverse
Open up your eyes
Your intact world will be destroyed
My short breath is by your side
There's nothing you can do
To stop me now
Wanted dead
The final sacrifice
Wanted dead
To preserve my reign
Wanted dead
Wanted dead
You can't ignore the warning signs
Strategies of hidden lies
You can't replace the truth by guns
Escape from all the wrath
Corruption
Selection
Murder and ritual washing
Depression
Regression
Triumph of increbulity
This made is forged in sacred tire
Disguised behind the holy war
Platoon leader's battlefield
To bring'em democratic law
Illusions
Confusions
Instinctive superstition
Worshipping
And praying
Revenge could be so sweet
Buried in the justice ground
Buried in the justice ground
You can't ignore the warning signs
Buried in the justice ground
Buried in the justice ground
Still waiting for deliverance
To stop the evil on the march
Insanity within our dreams
It's peach until eternity
Invasion
Of freedom
Extinguished optimism
The anger
The hunger
Morphine to hold the fire
You can't replace the truth of guns
Buried in the justice ground
Buried to stop the evil on the march
Buried in the justice ground
Eternity
Silent calls of solitude
Waiting for decline
Delivered from their passion
To spill the blood tonight
Laughing dead corruption
The truth is just a take
Undying hate is buried
Into a nameless grave
Don't be afraid
Don't run away
Their past has been divided
Emperor's sacrifice
The dead will take the reign
Blessed by the guns
City of god
Crawling deep into your soul
A life that fades away
Balanced on the edge of scorn
For whom you gonna pray
Terror without pity
Insane and tearing minds
All wars could be forgotten
When life is so unkind
Don't be afraid
Don't run away
Their past has been divided
Emperor's sacrifice
The dead will take the reign
Blessed by the guns
City of god
Don't be afraid
Don't run away
Their past has been divided
Emperor's sacrifice
City of god
The dead will take the reign
Blessed by the guns
City of god
They want to see our castles burning
False religions from a wicked spell
Commit crimes in ice cold blood
The tortured souls to dwell
Born dead creatures live again
Paralyzed to kill themselves
Reality that disappears
Forever buried dreams
The hate is spreading far away
Or in the neighbourhood maybe
When even life's collapse begins
Just what we need
Bibles and guns
Seems like monumental struggle
Of good and mighty evil
Everlasting devastation
Until the death redeemed
Born dead creatures live again
Paralyzed to kill themselves
Reality that disappears
Forever buried dreams
The hate is spreading far away
Or in the neighbourhood maybe
When even life's collapse begins
Just what we need
Bibles and guns
The debris covered our hope
To sleep the endless sleep
Peace no longer rest in my brain
My victim just for me
Born dead creatures live again
Paralyzed to kill themselves
Reality that disappears
Forever buried dreams
The hate is spreading far away
Or in the neighbourhood maybe
When even life's collapse begins
Just what we need
The hate is spreading far away
Or in the neighbourhood maybe
When even life's collapse begins
Just what we need
Bibles and guns
We've been called to defend our freedom
Our grief has turned to anger
We've seen the decency of loving people
Deliver them from foreign danger
We'll never rest
We're not relent
Until the day you get condemned
Axis of evil
Must be opposed
Axis of evil
Justice will come
Strike them down for god and liberty
To stand in a mindless world of hate
In the name of all humanity
Before the growing life decays
We will not fail
We will not tire
Rebellion to the godless crime
Must be opposed
Axis of evil
Justice will come
A faithful world behind the war
Nothing remains but endless peace
That's what we'll always fighting for
The bad will fall at least
We should be proud of our glory
Because of our past
The time is right to realize
We'll standing to the last
We've been called to defend our freedom
Our grief has turned to anger
We've seen the decency of loving people
Deliver them from foreign danger
We will not fail
We will not tire
Rebellion to the godless crime
Axis of evil
Must be opposed
Axis of evil
Justice will come
Axis of evil
Axis of evil
Justice will come
Awaking when the sky turns red
Spilling blood upon my face
The evil takes control
I'll follow your advice
Now I'll rape
I'll slash
I'll dominate
I will degrade
The silent calls of solitude
Believe me that I just want you
When I feel you deep inside
Waiting for decline
Now I'll pray
I'll love
I'll disappear
I will demand
You! Outside the truth
Open your veins
Try to seduce
Passion can't wait
Kiss of decay
And you will see
Lords of depravity
Without a doubt a find refuge
Anomaly or is it you
Exploring pleasures of my sin
Your death is all I see
Now I'll hate
I'll die
I will revile
I will reborn
You! Outside the truth
Open your veins
Try to seduce
Passion can't wait
Kiss of decay
And you will see
Lords of depravity
My attitudes
Will leave you paralyzed
Sadistic thoughts
That you will never realize my god
Don't wake me from this dream
Yell of rage
Inordinate
Maliciousness
Insanity
You can't escape
You gonna pay the price
No captures
Caught between the lines
No captures
Nated proud
It's just a fight to cover
All your hopes
Praise me in the name of endless wars
Don't wake me from this dream
Not secure
Around the world
I am the one
Who'll bring you down
I will descent
Until I reach the end
No captures
Caught between the lines
No captures
This is my kiss
Within a bite
Brings darkness to your light
Help me to say the promised word good-bye
Don't wake me from this dream
I despise
You recognize
Close your eyes
The order to die
No captures
No captures
I despise
You recognize
Close your eyes
The order to die
Nothing but
A pack of lies
Nothing but
Deceit
No captures
There is a voice without a sound
I'm sure that killers are all around
United foolbewitched by words
These weapons take control
Unjustifiable vindication
Irreparable devastation
Now the seals forever broken
Captured all the miseries
So take my hand I'll be your guide
Bloodstains on the desert ground
On the battlefield of wrath
Who starts the war machine?
Face the fact
The final act
I wanna set your spirit free
Take this pain
Buried by hate
Disguise the evil
Lay down the law
I crawl into your tortured brain
Can't reciprocate your humanity
There is no escape from the religious states
No final heal for mordancy
You never will release the wrath
Forever locked behind the walls
I'll leave you where you need to go
Awake the beast under the snow
An endless nightmare can't you see
That buried all humanity
You cannot fight the enemy
Who starts the war machine?
Face the fact
The final act
I wanna set your spirit free
Take this pain
Buried by hate
Disguise the evil
Lay down the law
There is a voice without a sound

Unjustifiable vindication
Irreparable devastation
Now the seals forever broken
Captured all the miseries
So take my hand I'll be your guide
Bloodstains on the desert ground
On the battlefield of wrath
Who starts the war machine?
Face the fact
The final act

Buried by hate
Disguise the evil
Lay down the law
Retribution
Decadence
Provocation
Ignorance
Nachination
Demise
Isolation
Suicide
Lay down the law
The smell of death is all around
Cold violence we adore
The daily deeds man for breakfast
Shall life renew these bodies of the truth
Abused visions and shattered dreams
From this pain and misery
Just pray to summon up the dead
Condemned to the capital punishment
You rule the world
You drink their blood
Betray their souls
You think you've
Nothing to regret
Wounds are bleeding flesh
Illusions of freedom
The symbols of your destiny
Prophecies of blasphemies
The reverence that died within
They are creeping upon you
Hatred venom seeping through
You want to be the master's blast
Ain't no promises that will last
Feel increasing mindless pain
To the epicentre of my hate
You rule the world
You drink their blood
Betray their souls
You think you've
Nothing to regret
Wounds are bleeding flesh
Illusions of freedom
The symbols of your destiny
You rule the world
You drink their blood
Betray their souls
You think you've
Nothing to regret
Wounds are bleeding flesh
Illusions of freedom
The symbols of your destiny
Insanity holds me tight
The lowest forms of my life
Fortification and gleam
To start the fire in me
Breaking all the rules
To breed my fear through you
Wrath is all you can see
Murder in the first degree
The enemy inside
I'm gonna lose my mind
The enemy inside
Waiting for the crime
Why have you been so blind
No religion feeds my mind
If blood runs warm and red
I'll leave you when you're dead
All promises I'll break
Every smile is just a fake
You're waiting for my caress
Incubation of your ashes
The enemy inside
I'm gonna lose my mind
The enemy inside
Waiting for the crime
The enemy inside
The enemy inside
Why have you been so blind
No religion feeds my mind
If blood runs warm and red
I'll leave you when you're dead
All promises I'll break
Every smile is just a fake
You're waiting for my caress
Incubation of your ashes
Tell me what you want to be
Your dream is my reality
Messing around with a gun
Can't undo what I've done
Can't undo what I've done
Reaching for the sky
Somebody's help to respite
Uncontrolled satisfaction
Response to your reaction
The enemy inside
I'm gonna lose my mind
The enemy inside
Waiting for the crime
The sin Of Sodom
The final sign 
Desert plains, the human race
Guilty breed, no love, just hate
Mighty lord, holy lot
Abraham, sulfur rain
Sulfur rain
A city on the desert plains
Defied by human race
Immortal life and sacrifice
Bring 'em to their knees
Armageddon's battlefield
Rising up the pentagram
Victims of a wicked world
Satans war machine is done
The sin of Sodom
The curse of God
Revenge for proud disgrace
The sin of Sodom
The curse of God
Destroyed the world in just a day
In just a day
Lord rained down the burning sulfur
Punished to the guilty breed
Separate the human nature
Replace the love into the hate
Walking through eternal fire
Realized that they have to fail
Delivered them from blind desire
Leave the death behind
The sin of Sodom
The curse of God
Revenge for proud disgrace
The sin of Sodom
The curse of God
Destroyed The World In Just A Day
In Just A Day
The sin of Sodom
Holy men virgins cry
Pregnant by their father's seed
There is no Prayer to survive
Deep inside misdeeds
The sky felt down to cover up
Burning flames that rise will be
Devastation of the Gods
To set the spirit free
The sin of Sodom
The curse of God
Revenge for proud disgrace
The sin of Sodom
The curse of God
Destroyed the world in just a day
In just a day
The sin of Sodom
Kings of agony
Walking on my way
Moon is shining bright
Murder and pain
Went the demons gate
Rotten flesh around
Sinners meet their fate
Lying on the ground
I got the power
Revenge is mine
That will be my faith
Destroy your life
Lords of raging storm
Piles of useless flesh
Immortality
See the face of dead
Bloody corpse, 
Bloody corpse
I always want the sacrifice
You can see it in my eyes
Driving on a fatal trail
I am the messenger of hell
Slaughtered by the holy sword
Master of the universe
Rituals of death and fear
Born by evils hands
I don't believe in
Resurrection of God
Beyond death
And uncontrolled
Sitting close to Satan
Spreading tears and blood
No prayers for the innocent
The final work is done
Bloody corpse,
Bloody corpse
I can't escape your lazy face
Buried in an ice cold grave
Captured by this nightmares end
From the kingdom of the damned
I am the reaper ans I'm God
Mourning cries from far beyond
A world you never realize
Within the hell inside
Bloody corpse
Warriors of hate
Ready for the slaughter
Hellish balls of fire
No promise to surrender
Rising from the dead
Possessed by bestial lust
Pain and despair
Around the godless Gods
Sons of hell
The sons of hell
Can't you hear their screams
Sons of hell
The sons of hell
Nightmare to your dreams
Satanic rituals
The sin we gonna pray
Reaper's breath is near
The devil's endless reign
Thousand deads there lie
Murdered by the sword
Demons and their bodies
Delivered by the Gods
Sons of hell
The sons of hell
Can't you hear their screams
Sons of hell
The sons of hell
Nightmare to your dreams
Searching for your haunted soul
Burn them in the silent night
You are the chosen one to die
You are the final sacrifice
There is a world of endless pain
Created by the denials
They will return to hell and back
No more time to pray
Walls of fire
No surrender
Possessed by evil
Lords of Satan
Possessed by evil force
There is no escape
Victims of your sins
Last human race
Candles all around
Within forgotten souls
Claws of Lucifer
Satan's work is done
Sons of hell
The sons of hell
Can't you hear their screams
Sons of hell
The sons of hell
Nightmare to your dreams
The sacred princess of the damned
They steal my soul and suffocate
Mighty lords of evil reign
Condemned me to the hellish flame
Feeded by eternal fire
Scorn of God will always rise
Voices from the holy chamber
Keep the fight and no surrender
You will die by the legions hands
Murderer uncontrolled
Among the lords of Satans land
Past away by demons swords
Tortured lives that will remain
Torment souls embrace the skies
Godless souls received the hate
Place where Angels die
Calling hordes of blasphemy
Thousands deads of destiny
Coming from the blackend sun
Awaking in the crimson mud
Revealed the shadows of the doom
Sodom is the fathers son
The leaders of malevolence
Looking forward to the end
You will die by the legions hands
Murderer uncontrolled
Among the lords of Satans land
Past away by demons swords
Tortured lives that will remain
Torment souls embrace the skies
Godless souls received the hate
Place where Angels die
Sodom, Legions, Lord, Hate
Evil, Dead, Holy, Sacred
The sacred princess of the damned
They steal my soul and suffocate
Mighty lords of evil reign
Condemned me to the hellish flame
Feeded by eternal fire
Scorn of God will always rise
Voices from the holy chamber
Keep the fight and no surrender
You will die by the legions hands
Murderer uncontrolled
Among the lords of Satans land
Past away by demons swords
Tortured lives that will remain
Torment souls embrace the skies
Godless souls received the hate

Dark deathknell call you to the throat of the glowing hell
Lights of exist become extinet and you read the epitaph of your grave
You are the chosen messenger of hell
Come execute your instruction with spell
You got magic power to all
In league with Satan for holy ghosts fall
The sepulchural voice
Love to drink the blood of the slut adore the bestial rite
Eat the virgins heart warm and sweet destroy the unborn holy meat
You are the chosen messenger of hell
Come execute your instruction with spell
You got magic power to all
In league with Satan for holy ghosts fall
The sepulchural voice
Mysterious groans torment your mind
The shadow of evil make you blind
A funeral song out of the burial place
Damned you to hell from the human race
The sepulchural voice
You are the chosen messenger of hell
Come execute your instruction with spell
You got magic power to all
In league with Satan for holy ghosts fall
The sepulchural voice
The soul that pines for eternity
Coming from the dark
Dweller of the twilight void
Ripping off my heart
When hell is freezing over
Never ending pain
Driven by your violence
The evil in my brain
Hatred of Gods
Hatred of the Gods
Warriors of haunted souls
Desire for the kill
Rituals of flesh and blood
Spreading Satans seed
Lords of hellish terror
Leading me the way
The day of wrath is near
Thousand lives yo break
Hatred of the Gods
Master of the sacrifice
Total Holocaust
Revealed your endless fear
On the altar of the Gods
The silent call of solitude
Now the time stands still
Into abyss of hopeless time
Do whatever you will
Hatred of the Gods
The shadows of hell curse your life
And no more time to pray
The reason for your destiny
When mighty Satans claw awaits
Ashes to Ashes
Ashes and Dust to Dust
Glaring eyes are watching you
Destruction is your inner fate
Storming rain from hateful skies
Before the angry sun will rise
Ashes to Ashes
Ashes to Ashes
And Dust to Dust
Your flesh is put on serpent fire
Your soul for them to feed
Awful painful death desire
Blinded by deceit
Prophecy, eternity
Time is running out
Inhuman black reality
Ripping off your heart
Ripping off your heart
Ripping off your heart
Ashes to Ashes
Ashes and Dust to Dust
You'll be gone into the past
Welcome to your end
Hallowed by your sacred name
Possessed by evils depth
Ashes to Ashes
Ashes to Ashes
And Dust to Dust
Ashes to Ashes
Ashes and Dust to Dust
Raised upon the silent grave
For thousand Years to dwell
Revealed the fire from abyss
Across the haunted fields
Ashes to Ashes
Ashes and Dust to Dust
It's time to die
Death stands behind the door
Satan sends his warriors
Demons break out of hell
Shrill cries
Angel dies
Shrill cries
Outbreak of evil
Outbreak of evil
With swords and axes
The fight hard
In a massacre
They feel the hot smart
Shrill cries
Angel dies
Shrill cries
Outbreak of evil
Outbreak of evil...
None can survive
People will destroy
Souls like hell
Where demons make a toy
Shrill cries
Angel dies
Shrill cries
Outbreak of evil
Outbreak of evil...
Rape, Abuse, Pain, Might
Defloration, penetration
Laughing silence, glowing eyes
Defloration, excruciation
Heartbeats like a distance fight
Fear, Greed, Desire, Lust
Defloration, penetration
Laughing silence, glowing eyes
Defloration, excruciation
Heartbeats like a distance fight
Awaking the beast, ready to kill
Branded nightmare on your skin
Sacrifice, you're number one
Sinners delight, don't try to Run
Seeking the blood, no control
Coming through
Let it flow
Defloration, penetration
Defloration, penetration
Your fate is sealed, around this night
For whom you cry, You pay the price
Just you and me, there is no lord
I'll curse You
To another world
To another World
Flesh, Tears, Smell
Screams, Blood, Dead
Defloration, penetration
Laughing silence, glowing eyes
Defloration, excruciation
Heartbeats like a distance fight
Contempt of sanity
A domination of the beast
The end of you and me
Cruel die the least
Dark is the night for all
Deplorable we try to crawl
Hollow the dead we fear
Nescient why we are here
One man's meat is another man's poison
One's blind street leads another to reason
Dark alleys of the death seamed with corpses
Gore rotten beds of carred skin in tatters
Fractured minds, impure dead visions
Puking downwards with derision
Raping souls of carnivores
Soaking butchered to the core
Rupture the sluice of mental sewage
Don't shed a tear down on bony pewage
Now you know how fetid death breathes
I'm leaving you in war and pieces
In war and pieces
In war and pieces
Dying creatures gonna burst asunder
About maltreated sobbing bodies i wander
Dark heaven lowering above us all
Angel of death, can't you hear my call
Blain on the head of selective retention
Splinters to remove the intolerably tension
The adumbration of mental plague
Broken eyes peer wide awake
Rupture the sluice of mental sewage
Don't shed a tear down on bony pewage
Now you know how fetid death breathes
I'm leaving you in war and pieces
In war and pieces
In war and pieces
Die by my hand in the same dark prison
In your head you will keep the vision
Leave this live with shattered brain
Slightly driving you insane
In war and pieces
Sudden gleams arise the sky
Rulers of the global fire
Death in perpetuity
To contaminate the clean
Spiteful anger
Devotion carved in stone
There is no
Redeemer
Darkened skies above
Hellfire
Can't push my face into the ground
Trapped and collapsed internal parts
Watch the fading blood red lights
Avert from moon and stars
Thrashing the tomb
To reveal what is inside
Disfigured
Rotten corpses
Leaving crucified
Hellfire
They sleep the wrath of aeons
Life that drowned in fire
With ghosts and the ancient stones
Leave the sentenced fate behind
Haunt the dreams in endless wars
Praying for the day of doom
Never find somebody's lap
To die into
Sudden gleams arise the sky
Rulers of the global fire
Death in perpetuity
To contaminate the clean
Hellfire
Arousing kiss of tempting pointed lips
Penetrating scuff-marked abiotic flesh
It clarifies my sceptic view of life
Sucks me in my darkest nights
Dissolving all my soul's extract
In my enraptured mind
A pathogen of cruellest dreams
Succumb to my desire
Snake of decay
Bloody stains
Through toxic veins
Mental impurification in progress
Teasing with these rattlesnakes
I'm saddle-sore through my ride of gore
Crucifixion of these rotting corpses
Shooting at the frontline
Spitting from the top
And on my way back
I will step the mob
I'm raped and caressed
Inside my head
Through toxic veins
Decapitated
Devastated
Amputation
Vivisection
Reciprocated
Reanimated
The evil is inside
Trapped is my faith into you
Carnivorous ferocity
Disfigured chunks of flinching meat
The epidemic spreads with tremendous wrath
Decomposing fragmented carcass
Frenetically I fall for thee
Through toxic veins
My deadly elixir
I roam and seek
Embalmed and meek
Through toxic veins
Through toxic veins
Self inflicted inner strain
Copulated with insanity and hate
My hunger got materialized
Underestimated spite
Throats and faces circumvented
Externally altered and disfigured
Trapped within this lurid nightmare
But I want to keep you by my side
Nothing counts more than blood
A pal remains so deathless
Never turn your back to god
Nothing counts more than blood
Fouled up beyond all recognition
Slashed the pain to a higher position
Death will never frighten me
Contradictions seed to kill
Inconsistency with my religion
Can't decide my vic selection
The final captures can't elude
Above destructive attitudes
Attitudes
nothing counts more than blood
A pal remains so deathless
Never turn your back to god
Nothing counts more than blood
Voices from the damned, I want to leave
When dreams begin to cease
Hear the sound of the marching man
At far beyond machine gun rang
You don't know what you're fighting for
The burning world reflects the war
Dead bodies served as rifle rest
And protection when the bullets blast
No retreat from hell's domain
When hunters become prey
Become prey
Nothing counts more than blood
A pal remains so deathless
Never turn your back to god
Nothing counts more than blood
With false security life passes through my eyes
Obliterated souls just memories remain
I am the adjuratory dance of the flames
Transforming into the holy shapes
I can't control the rage
Everlasting pain
No distracting foes
I'm gonna be your god
Storm raging up
I'm ready to set this world on fire
Storm raging up
Flaring up my hate
Rise and destroy
Rushing to the flash zone
Bombing of the black stone
Wearing the mask of eternal gloom
A radical conviction confirming to the doom
Cutting the throat of humanity
Replacing the boon by the dark agony
I can't control the rage
Everlasting pain
No distracting foes
I'm gonna be your god
Storm raging up
I'm ready to set this world on fire
Storm raging up
Flaring up my hate
Rise and destroy
Rushing to the flash zone
Bombing of the black stone
My love is buried somewhere underneath
Can't follow the rules of your society
Start the war for a thousand years
Into the glory arms of despiteful death
Removal of the grind
Wake up before you die
Stimulated sins
Absorbing through your skin
Storm raging up
I'm ready to set this world on fire
Storm raging up
Flaring up my hate
Storm raging up
Your feigned death throes deceived me
Your false dead eyes released me
Although your blood still flows
It's only feigned death throes
I tear you and you'll like it
I drink you 'til you're weak
Death itself with ugly face
Through pores of bloody skin
Feigned death throes
Feigned death throes
Engrained misanthropy
Sowed the seeds of death
When hatred amplifies your pain
I am the one who pulls the string
There's no way left for you to win
I knew you would not stay
Your feigned death throes deceived me
Your false dead eyes released me
Although your blood still flows
It's only feigned death throes
I tear you and you'll like it
I drink you 'til you're weak
Death itself with ugly face
Through pores of bloody skin
Feigned death throes
With feverish eyes i stare
Through shadows in the moor
You don't know what you'll have to bear
I'm standing there alone
'til someone comes along
A loaded pistol in my hand
Split second in despair
So you planned a fake
While you heard your bones all break
Arise this glory day
I will survive i will defeat
Destroy the man that I've become
Feigned death throes
Feigned death throes
Release the breeding ground of my hate
The planet shakes from my atomic weight
I am the enemy i want to see you fall
Every move you make is under my control
To all the prayers in this world
My cries will leave this mud unheard
Salvation
Damnation
Born unwanted
Godless
No bless
Fight
Destroy it
Soul contraband
Soul contraband
Life and love is hidden from my eyes
Lost in the paradise of sacrifice
Millions follow and millions lost
Lay down to die without a final sound
Watch a broken nation die
Words of wisdom are denied
Decrepit
Misguided
Presumption of death
Release
A pulse
You ll never understand
Soul contraband
I am your destiny
Get up from your knees
Scream for your soul
There is no more hope
Caught in my rage
Terminated
There is a storm
At the horizon
Soul contraband
Soul contraband
War drags them to the very end
The blushing sun has turned to red
Death slumbers
In dawn's blue light
Reflecting
In the sea of blood
For evil to be made
Hell is burning
From the dungeons
Of emotions
Apprehension death
Scars of misery
God bless you, the nations heart
A bond closer than brothers
With a rifle in your gracious hand
You ll leave the shadows of the dead
One by one
One by one
They took their souls and cut their wings
Considering all their energy
War hungry
Bullets eating flesh
Can't kill the
Spirit of a man
That's hidden from their eyes
Heaven's caving
Intimidate deforming
Ever lastingly caught
The sin to the holy sky
God bless you, the nations heart
A bond closer than brothers
With a rifle in your gracious hand
You ll leave the shadows of the dead
God bless you
One by one
God bless you
One by one
God bless you, the nations heart
With a rifle in your gracious hand
God bless you, the nations heart
A bond closer than brothers
With a rifle in your gracious hand
You ll leave the shadows of the dead
They've gone to sleep lain down the fight
Carry the weight of the land to the sky
The holy ground sacred by their blood
Helmets resting on the guns butt
We'll always be one step ahead
Discovering our relentless pride
Decadence, your state of being
There s more than evil in their minds
God bless you
One by one
God bless you
One by one
Screams of pain dismembering the wind
Storms of corruption elevating my wings
Souls withered in my flameless frost
No difference between my hate and your love
Wearing a mask of a bad religion
Like self-inflicted injury
Feeling the tension in every way
Unadulterated victory
The art of killing poetry
Created by misanthropy
The secret abyss of strength within
Tearing the epidermis from your skin
Disseminated decay of my death
Silhouettes without extremities
Wearing a mask of a bad religion
Like self-inflicted injury
Feeling the tension in every way
Unadulterated victory
The art of killing poetry
To bring the dark upon the light
Created by misanthropy
Beneath the crimson tide
Wearing a mask of a bad religion
Like self-inflicted injury
Feeling the tension in every way
Unadulterated victory
The art of killing poetry
Created by misanthropy
The art of killing poetry
To bring the dark upon the light
Created by misanthropy
Beneath the crimson tide
Distinction of hatred
Finally revealed
The fears that you dread
Shattered are your screams
To this world where i am god
Drowned into the fire
I ll terminate your nest
And reach your demise
Pollutes the ground a rotten red
Hope will be no use
A styptic parasite
Caught to survive
Sovereign from hell
Deadly virus so impure
Styptic parasite
Unseen or in disguise
Thrashed and revealed
Evil spreading out of my soul
Seeking
Killer
Instinct
Result of endless years
Crying of denials
Craving your blood
Stillborn black dreams
See you tremble
When your hidden panic grows
Remain within the circle
Unspoken words of death
Reclaim my broken past
An evil thrives inside my soul
The darkest place i know
Like a styptic parasite
Caught to survive
Sovereign from hell
Deadly virus so impure
Styptic parasite
Unseen or in disguise
Thrashed and revealed

Styptic parasite
I have faced the war too many times
Just saw an endless void
Evil was delivered by a claw
When I inhaled the mighty ghost
Life and death long written down
Unwilling to copulate
When demons answered to my call
I was conceived by fiendish pain
Here I am
In a shadowland
Here I am
In retribution
Within my world that I despite
My body is taller than my soul
The helping hand is out of reach
Laying visions on the grave
An occult urge to feed
My ragged wounds are rubbed with salt
Agitation behind the eyes of faith
Barbed wire holds me tight
Insanity that keeps me sane
Here I am
In a shadowland
Here I am
In retribution
Within my world that I despite
Upon a stake of fear I rest
Flesh returns to earth
With wide open eyes I raise the dead
Waiting for release
God's commandments disobeyed
Signed with kosher blood
Silence has been broken
The path of hell is what you chose
Don't mutilate my body
Don't shoot me full of holes
Death retakes the storm of life
Impenetrable soul
Here I am
In a shadowland
Here I am
In retribution
Here I am
In a shadowland
Here I am
In retribution
Within my world that I despite
Getting closer to the gasping prey
To learn the need of private war
Hand in hand with rotting death
Return to god in parts
Without remorse
Damnation on my rusty skin
Curtain fire in my head
Unconsciously killing all the dead
Just fire and forget
Abstracted deep in lust
Just fell in love with guns
Don't wonder
You are a part of rolling thunder
Rolling thunder
Rolling thunder
I struggled with myself
When I looked into those hollow eyes
Upheld that fragile honor
That disappeared into the endlessness of time
You are a part of rolling thunder
Rolling thunder
Rolling thunder
I chose the path of blind dissension
I never woke up when I heard the cries
My everlasting hate to be revealed
As kids were dying by their mother's side
I earned the seed of retaliation
Destroyed the fruits of human race
Desensitized by blood and ichor
Returning home with a bag on my face
Abstracted deep in lust
Just fell in love with guns
Don't wonder
You are a part of rolling thunder
Rolling thunder
Rolling thunder
I struggled with myself
When I looked into those hollow eyes
Upheld that fragile honor
That disappeared into the endlessness of time
My inner conflict
My frantic face
My desperation
Waiting for the final breath
My wrong belief
My fateful deeds
My aweless pride
Hope to reach the other side
I saw my comrades
Yielding up their fate
They passed away
With water for their final grave
Decision day
With doom beyond
The hell invited me
To leave this world
With dreams of liberty
Decision day
Your blind courage
Your iron will
Your senseless orders
War will end in victory
Your machine gun fire
Your ruling liar
Your battle ground
Soaked with blood of honor
I saw my comrades
Yielding up their fate
They passed away
With water for their final grave
Decision day
With doom beyond
The hell invited me
To leave this world
With dreams of liberty
Decision day
Their cold anger
Their despite
Their misanthropy
For men who fought and died
Their megalomania
Their reign of terror
Their armored life
A godless hail of fire
I saw my comrades
Yielding up their fate
They passed away
With water for their final grave
Decision day
With doom beyond
The hell invited me
To leave this world
With dreams of liberty
Decision day
Surrounded by the death
Along the beach
The doomsday just released
So close in front of me
Decision day
Decision day
Screams of doom
Pride and hate
Bound in shadows
Sperm profusion
False decision
Inner rotting
Pervy kisses
Disgusting public executions
Devastating revolution
Aristocrated prostitution
Lord of the dead
Reign of violence
King of defiance
Demonic creature
Unholy preacher
Crowned with kinky insanity
Caught in sexual misery
Mighty evil imperator
Unholy creature
Insane aggressor

Repudiate your frantic face
Can't confess this bluff
My eyes are betraying that what I see
That defiles my blood
Laughter from the holy ground
Conflict within my dreams
The evil shines through the skies
Awakened by hateful screams
Hoping, praying
For those who collapsed
Craving, invoking the peace
Cursing, despising
Sectarian killing
Armageddon is near
My god is not my master
And prayers just to hell the lies
Light disappears in darkness
Into your wooden eyes
Who is god?
The testament divines the fact
My life is gone before I die
A place of insincerity
Where just dead bodies lie
Your hell will be my constant pain
My inner brokenness declines
Be sure that you're the chosen one
That last face you'll see is mine
Hoping, praying
For those who collapsed
Craving, invoking the peace
Cursing, despising
Sectarian killing
Armageddon is near
My god is not my master
And prayers just to hell the lies
Light disappears in darkness
Into your wooden eyes
Who is god?
Lost in the cryptic kingdom
Can't pass the point of death
Everlasting superstition
Engraved in spineless flesh
Hoping, praying
For those who collapsed
Craving, invoking the peace
Cursing, despising
Sectarian killing
Armageddon is near
My god is not my master
And prayers just to hell the lies
Light disappears in darkness
Into your wooden eyes
Who is god?
You're crawling like a desert worm
Praying for graciousness
Trapped within my obscure dungeon
Staring through the darkness
Your god is just an apparition
Your misbelief's warning dead
Don't ignore the warning signs
We've got the gold, you've got the lead
Exposed to my arbitrariness
because death means nothing to you
Disconnected from reality
Wherever you will find refuge
Into a strange lost world
Into a strange lost world
Belligerence and conflagration
Hateful echos from the sky
Blind and faithful unto death
Desensitized humanity
Your god is just an apparition
Your misbelief's morally dead
Don't ignore the warning signs
We've got the gold, you've got the lead
Exposed to my arbitrariness
'Cause death means nothing to you
Disconnected from reality
Wherever you will find refuge
Into a strange lost world
Into a strange lost world
The holy hunter becomes prey
His armor is destroyed
Condemned just by a single shot
To tear the war out of your head
Exposed to my arbitrariness
because death means nothing to you
Disconnected from reality
Wherever you will find refuge
Into a strange lost world
Shaded reality
Consecrated lunacy
The crown of creation defiled
Abhorrence in their eyes
Oppressed aberration
Disintegration
Doomed to destruction
Helpless subjection
Inseminated with greed
Hostage of terror
Victimized fellow
Marching to break the peace
Legions of agony
Blind insanity
Vaginal born evil
Satanic but divine
Vaginal born evil
Ruthless and blind
Raised up swords
Unleashed force
Ritualized decapitation
Life termination
Hallowed stones
In the hands of gods
To kill by lapidation
Licentious persecution
War spreading through the air
Imprecation
Brutalization
Salvation fall into despair
Violence growing
Through bloodless veins
Vaginal born evil
Satanic but divine
Vaginal born evil
Ruthless and blind
The dead remains alive
Selective terror
Invasive pleasure
The holy world in shattered state
Dehumanized
Buried minds
Vaginal born evil
Satanic but divine
Vaginal born evil
Ruthless and blind
Shot down in a blazed of glory
Suicidal and unholy
But stand the spitting fire serpent
The truth will dominate the end
Vaginal born evil
Satanic but divine
Vaginal born evil
Ruthless and blind
Lewdness tearing me apart
It demands my blood as sacrifice
Impaled and stained on a spear
While searching for perpetual cure
The darkest coffin be my throne
Searing faith upon my soul
Through countless prophecies I rode
My retreating was resolved
Where is god to reign supreme
Death instead of silken slumber
My life forever be
In belligerence
Thriving on hypocrisy
Trapped in dark divinity
Harassing fire shreds my skin
Predestinated for the sin
Unwillingness has been erased
Just escaped the gates of hate
Through countless prophecies I rode
My retreating was resolved
Where is god to reign supreme
Death instead of silken slumber
My life forever be
In belligerence
I count disembodied extremities
Unwillingness has been erased
Can't hold my breath when blood is shed
Just escaped the gates of hate
Through countless prophecies I rode
My retreating was resolved
Where is god to reign supreme
Death instead of silken slumber
My life forever be
In belligerence

World pacification
The shadows will return
Insidious conflagration
When life begins to burn
Awake that's sleeping deep inside
Slumbering mercenaries
Disclose the mass demise
Forsaken generosities
When daylight disappears into hell
Unholy clouds of death prevail
Sacred warpath
The gods within the guns combined
The book of lies for faithless minds
Sacred warpath
That keeps the emptiness inside
Crusades the dawn of time
Sliding down the drains
Summoning the elder void
Eating up your brains
Dissected umbilical cord
Endless bleeding skies
To overcast the battleground
Blood seeping from my eyes
Death aiming at my heart
When daylight disappears into hell
Unholy clouds of death prevail
Sacred warpath
The gods within the guns combined
The book of lies for faithless minds
Sacred warpath
That keeps the emptiness inside
Crusades the dawn of time
Who is the enemy and friend?
Who looks a lot like me
A fellow man with friendly fire
Who'll be the first at least
Everything that moves at night
Will kiss the bullet's lead
Your blood in different colors
Heralding doom without a pact
Sacred warpath
The gods within the guns combined
The book of lies for faithless minds
Sacred warpath
That keeps the emptiness inside
Crusades the dawn of time
Martyr of the devil
Contacting the dead
Unexplained footsteps
Carved into flesh
Sulfuric smell
Convulsing in pain
Demonic possessions
Deplorable hate
Worshipping death
Physically recoiled
Replacing the cross
By fire and sword
Suicidal abuse
Gulping urine
Exorcised
Exorcised
Chastised by Satan
Ravished the blood
Profaned conviction
Defiled artifacts
Spiritual voices
And she levitated
Scratching the walls
Evil delivered

Physically recoiled
Replacing the cross

Suicidal abuse
Gulping urine

No mercy
No sympathy for you
Unbounded
My urge is so impure
Ingenious
I will find your trace
Can't stand it
The beauty of your pain
In my world you're left alone
My claws so deep inside your heart
Prey drive and disorder
Coldblooded slaughter
Maltreatment
Your innocence declined
Reflections
That never reached my eyes
No comfort
To mitigate your fear
Confessions
That never touched my eyes
Don't try to run, don't try to hide
My wheezing breath so close behind
Forever caught in my domain
Be sure that you will not escape
I am the alpha leader
Pitiless and greedy
Your death conserves my species
Predatory instinct
Unending
My hunger is my guard
Defaced
My inner peace of mind
Trailing
Rooting out your nest
No one
Will ever find your rest
Under the stimulus of hunger
And no control to terminate
I lose all my inhibitions
I'll leave your shell exsanguinate
I am the alpha leader
Pitiless and greedy
Your death conserves my species
Predatory instinct

There is a bewitched temple of lust
In that wicked forest petrified
Perverse dissoluteness
Never changed or compromised
They wallowed in vice
They moaned in lust
Seeking out flesh
Baptized in blood
The midnight of terror
Surrendered in pain
And saved the angels from disgrace
The golden wine cups were empty
And their swollen lips were cold
They could not resist the evil inside
When the frozen morning dawned in
Sodom and Gomorrah
Sodom and Gomorrah
Slaughtered human material
They died a thousand deaths
Libidinous, butchered and quartered
Even Satan shunned this place
They rang the bell
Distress ignored
Death took their hands
They begged for more
Concupiscence would keep their faith
Holy serpents victimized
The golden wine cups were empty
And their swollen lips were cold
They could not resist the evil inside
When the frozen morning dawned in
Sodom and Gomorrah
Sodom and Gomorrah
The fire of heaven descended
To the mystical body of God
No promises can be fulfilled
The justice demands his wrath
Mature fruits turns into ashes
Flowing life rotten to death
Godlessness and glowing hatred
Grace refused, hell damnation
The golden wine cups were empty
And their swollen lips were cold
They could not resist the evil inside
When the frozen morning dawned in
Sodom and Gomorrah
Pain-relieving, no more feeling
Walk the line of death
Elimination, dis-inhibition
Unrestrained contempt
Defaming truth, fatal abuse
Lay down your life to me
Abnegation, no sedation
Palliative machines
Constant irritant lovely sights
You will see before you die
When God speaks through a murderer
A docile heart should bleed
I can't decide what's wrong or right
My lust corroding from inside
Benevolence will not prevail
I'm stimulated by your screams
Euthanasia
Mass dissection, natural selection
Disgraced without compassion
Painless Hypnos, demonic Thanatos
Medical interventions
Pitiless, no godliness
I'll never set you free
Endless sleep, the god you seek
Your only destiny
Constant irritant lovely sights
You will see before you die
When God speaks through a murderer
A docile heart should bleed
I can't decide what's wrong or right
My lust corroding from inside
Benevolence will not prevail
I'm stimulated by your screams
Euthanasia
No amnesty, no faith in God
Hippocratic face
Bad intentions, blood addicted
Narcotic twilight state
Tombs of lies, convulsions stops
Demigod in white
Needled skins, frozen blood
Underhanded smiles
Constant irritant lovely sights
You will see before you die
When God speaks through a murderer
A docile heart should bleed
I can't decide what's wrong or right
My lust corroding from inside
Benevolence will not prevail
I'm stimulated by your screams
Euthanasia
Two angels on the way to hell
Chosen by the grace of god
They came to show a final sign
To save a righteous man
Blessed those who always kept their faith
Destroy the ones who live in sin
Glowing cities down below
Evil cannot win
The judgement day will come
When all the sinners have to pay
So leave this place and don't look back
Before it's coming to an end
The skies above their heads
Razed for eternity
Dead sea and rivers of red
The brimstone raining overcast
Into the fiery gorge of hell
Revealed their treacherous facade
When the holy fire fell
Blessed those who always kept their faith
Destroy the ones who live in sin
Glowing cities down below
Evil cannot win
God struck em all with blindness
They could not see the truth
Sodom and the sinful plains
Solidified and scorched
The skies above their heads
Razed for eternity
Dead sea and rivers of red
Lot woke up in a frightened dream
To leave this wicked land
Up to the sacred hills
His daughters by his hands
Blessed those who always kept their faith
Destroy the ones who live in sin
Glowing cities down below
Evil cannot win
When he killed everyone around
And no one was reprieved
No righteous men were found
No warning signs to leave that night
The skies above their heads
Razed for eternity
Dead sea and rivers of red
Ruthful enemy
The skies above their heads
Razed for eternity
Dead sea and rivers of red
Death to the living and long live the killers
Riding in the lightning storm
Beneath the tides, the beast inside
Heaven's ugly silence overall
Marks of inner crucifixion
Deep inside his face
Through conflicts of convictions
Gazing towards to the stars
Concealed beneath the sea
Covered by the blackened hell
Command him against all lovings
No wisdom's words to tell
The dreaded creature disappeared
Carried down their innocent souls
I'll follow him around the horn
My superstition be remold
I'll keep on tracking all the time
My sordid end is near
The all-destroying sperm
I am the harpooneer
Unsounded sea, his fate is sealed
The black ship cross the sky
His doom awaits, the dreams of hate
Through determined eyes
Is it him or god to who
Who lift this mortal arm?
Who is the doom when the judge himself
Is dragged before the bar?
Concealed beneath the sea
Covered by the blackened hell
Command him against all lovings
No wisdom words to tell
The dreaded creature disappeared
Carried down their innocent souls
I'll follow him around the horn
My superstition be remold
I'll keep on tracking all the time
My sordid end is near
The all-destroying sperm
I am the harpooneer
God's wrath awaits, no time to pray
He's wide awake inside
God-given courage paired with lust
To stand a hopeless fight
The jaws of hell, no tales to tell
Threats of blasphemy
Larger than life, he'd strike the sun
If it insulted him
All truth with malice in it
Against the nature's law
I'll wreak my hate upon him
From the bottom of my heart
Concealed beneath the sea
Covered by the blackened hell
Command him against all lovings
No wisdom's words to tell
The dreaded creature disappeared
Carried down their innocent souls
I'll follow him around the horn
My superstition be remold
I'll keep on tracking all the time
My sordid end is near
The all-destroying sperm
I am the harpooneer
Rapacity, vanity, disloyalty, apathy
Degradation, isolation, mental petrification
Exorbitance, decadence, avarice, indifference
Infiltration, obliteration, devilish humiliation
Tumbling down the endless gulch
Intent with empty eyes
The treacherous reality
With covering demise
Insecurity alarmed
With conflicts in your mind
The world has gone insane and dehumanized
Intractability, insanity, anarchy, stupidity
Depredation, exploitation, antagonistic demolition
Sinfulness, imperiousness, wickedness, unscrupulousness
Manipulation, execution, inauspicious disillusion

You can't preserve your securities
Beneath enchanted walls of rotten bones
Eternity descended somewhere in time
Everlasting search for a truth never told
Your life disappears, your body remains
Smoldering amber released the end
Secular wrath, venom misery
Nourished by your own contempt
Occult perpetrator
Occult perpetrator
Agony spreads its baleful wings
To paralyze the peaceful world
The kingdom felt in anarchy
Invisible parasite needs a host
Your life disappears, your body remains
Smoldering amber released the end

Nourished by your own contempt
Occult perpetrator

It can't leave you dead or dying
But in a perfect world, it will resist

We were young boys in old men's bodies
Beheaded but still alive
Baptized in foreign blood
Dead for sure before we died
Darkness fulfilled the yearning dreams
They slipped the sucking baby from the breast
Rolling in, straight ahead, the chasm just in front of me
Streaming flames, a thousand suns, the sky is full of greed
Bellowing bombs pick up the slick, there is no place like war
The cannons spurt, the angels cry, staring down the hallowed ground
Surrounded by the goddamn brute, a war you never understood
Receiving fire from the western side
No time to breathe, no warning signs
Condemned for all eternity
Don't want to die in bits and pieces
The fire destroys, but darkness remains
Into the open eyes of the living dead
Their diaries painted in blood
Revived from crimson mud
We were young boys in old men's bodies
Beheaded but still alive
Baptized in foreign blood
Dead for sure before we died
Darkness fulfilled the yearning dreams
They slipped the sucking baby from the breast
Invade and escape, it's not for real
I turned my eyes to Heaven
Raging storm, it's not a drill
There's something out of Hell
Wailing sirens, breaking bones
Manual pest control
I've flown my eagle slow enough
To see you clearly die
Surrounded by the goddamn brute
A war you never understood
Receiving fire from the western side
No time to breathe, no warning signs
Condemned for all eternity
Don't want to die in bits and pieces
The fire destroys, but darkness remains
Into the open eyes of the living dead
Society divided, economy collapsed
Violence and injustice
Maltreated and suppressed
Mind-controlled and brainwashed
Ethical declined, unpredictability
Breaking through the lines
No freedom of speech, human deceit
Mercenary, blasphemy
Social neglect, no regret
Brutalization, intimidation
Wanna get out of here
Bring me out
To the road of no return
Wanna get out of here
Bursting out
Kill the enemy
Indoctrination
Indoctrination
Chaotic days, physical decayed
Pandemonium, sound of pain
Mental agony, disgusting stench
Broken bones, unruly hate
Provocation, dilapidation
Perpetual adoration
Malicious entity
Deceitful democracy
Wanna get out of here
Bring me out
To the road of no return
Wanna get out of here
Bursting out
Kill the enemy
Indoctrination
Indoctrination
Wanna get out of here
Bring me out
To the road of no return
Wanna get out of here
Bursting out
Kill the enemy
Indoctrination
Shooting from behind
Spitting from the left
How long I'll stay alive
When blood flows down my back
Fratricidal slaughter
No enemy to observe
Premeditated murder
To await the final shot
We were on the same side
Don't know when I close my eyes
Suicidal duteousness
Homicidal helplessness
Hostile fire all I see
Terminal supremacy
Death could be the only way
To get out of this place
Friendly fire
Compassion is lost
Friendly fire
Friendly fire blast
Napalm hell surrounded me
Screeching Gatling guns
Hissing fifty BMGs
Among the eagles and the stars
I would trade my finest gold
To shoot that fellows down
Within the peaceful skies above
And leave that firestorm
We were on the same side
Don't know when I close my eyes
Suicidal duteousness
Homicidal helplessness
Hostile fire all I see
Terminal supremacy
Death could be the only way
To get out of this place
Friendly fire
Compassion is lost
Friendly fire
Friendly fire blast
My comrade is lying next to mine
He stopped the bullet destined for me
Spreading guts that burned my eyes
No more control in that crimson tide
The friendly terror's final end
My comrade's blood, mixed with mine
Calling out from depth of souls
The warm red blood that turns to slime
Friendly fire
Compassion is lost
Friendly fire
Friendly fire blast
Beyond the mountains
where the wind cries out its pain
Deserted valleys
where the darkness always reigned
Where the sunlight never ever
touched the poisoned ground
Where the laugh of undead children
never ever sound
Forever wrapped in darkness
the forgotten valleys of Hades
Forgotten damned domains
where curse and hate collide
Where the cold and darkness meet
and the truth have turned to lie
Where the flame of love growls cold
and its powers never rise
And hand of death has grasped
every form of light
Forever wrapped in darkness
the forgotten valleys of Hades
I close your eyes
and send you into vainly dreams
I reign your soul
the night engulf your painful screams
I watch you cry and
twist your soul in agony
No prayers can save you now
from hell in eternity
I devastate your soul
and lacerate your mind
In sin I sanctify my
sword to crush your spine
I'm the Reaper
You're too confused
you can't elude my misty eyes
No need to hang on
to your faith in love and life
Whatever I command
your soul obeys my needs
You're like a zombie now
with a soul that burns and bleeds
There's not much left of you
your soul belongs to me
Nothing can save you now
or set your spirit free
I'm the Reaper
Coming to take you
I love the sight of having you
down and open wide
The smell of a dead woman's flesh
just drives me fucking wild
I have to got you in my grasp now
there is no need to escape
I'll penetrate you
every virgin needs a rape
Just when you think you have
gone through all that gives you pain
I'm coming back to you
to penetrate again
I'm the Reaper
Heil satanic majesty
tonight we sacrifice
We drink our own blood
and blasphemy while
the moon is our only light
We whisper our sorcery
the acid takes us high
We sing the songs of Mayhem
Wingless angel
in soundless flight
Our bodies completes the circle
with blood we draw the signs of hell
Chant the force of Pandemonium
and recite the words of spell
Necromancy
I gather up the force of darkness
to bring damnation lust and war
Demand all heaven's virgins
to bend before our horny lord
Tonight nothing is too sacred
we desecrate and live in sin
Inhaling the stench of rotten flesh
and of burning winds
Descend from blackened skies
on soundless magic wings
To spread the words of Satan
and live in eternal sin
I summoned up the living dead
and demons in the skies
I drank from chalice warm and red
and watched the virgin die
Present at ungodly births in holy paradise
I spread eternal dark on earth
And raped mother of Christ
Oh, mother of Christ
C'mon baby raise your knife
Welcome darling to my sacrifice
Oh, sacrifice
Tie the angel to the altar
Sacrifice to Lord of hell
Let the warm blood torrent, baby
While the moonlight sets the night on spell
I saw the lightning strike in the skies
And heard you roar of pain
Oh, lift the knife and strike once more
Your blood is mixed with the rain
C'mon baby raise your knife
Welcome darling to my sacrifice
Oh, sacrifice
The lies of Christ will lose
the ways of hell I chose
I drink the floating blood
defy the fury of God
I have turned my back on Christ
to hell I have sacrificed
I have made love to the Pagan Queen
the gates of hell I have seen
I heard the angels cry
I watched the witches fly
I saw the clouds of death
Slowly blackening the sky
I read the book of spell
I chimed death's ancient bell
and when I die I have a place
reserved in hell
In conspiracy with Satan
I ride the bloodstained goat
I let the brewage float
I have seen the reaper's face
and walked through eternal haze
I have kissed my master's hand
I have seen the children of the damned
I heard the demons call
and seen a thousand virgins fall
I swear the oath of blood
and tear the virgin's flesh
I gash the wounds of heaven
and rides the wings of death
Tonight the cauldrons are filled
with brewage madeEof hate
Tonight we blasphemy
possessed we desecrate
Tonight we raise our cups
and toast in an angels blood
Salute hell's victory
despise the words of God
Armageddon
Eternal battlefields
no prisoners we take
We rape your sacred souls
behind the seven gates
Tonight you all will hear
the angels cry of pain
and in the sky you will see
the all eternal flame
On earth you mortal fools
obey the christian ways
but there is no mighty God
to hear your final prayers
Armageddon
Forks of lightning strikes in the sky
the sound of thunder rolls
Satan, chimes the bell of death
and beckon all your souls
Heaven's angels realizes
there is no place they can hide
Tonight the furnace gates of hell
stands open wide
Black witch of beauty
hovers around and cast her spells
Tonight a virgin's womb
shall breed a son of hell
Armageddon
Dust to dust
I gasp for air
I scream for sight
and fight against
torment and dread
Calling the vengeance
I tear at the lid
and promise to raise
from the dead
Black witch of beauty
all hell's necromancers
give me the powers of hell
Mistress of curse
reapers and vultures
Demons stand up
and chime the bell
Suddenly powers comes
from within
Muscles and mind are
filled with wrath
I burst out in frenzy
powers of hell
and break up the
tomb and the dark
The bells of war doth chime tonight
and the heavens shake with fear
The earth commot the sky is in flames
the battle is ever near
Troops of Hell tonight they storm
The walls they so despise
Heaven's gates are closing in
The night is filled with cries
A crack of thunder, a smell of death
the wind of mayhem blows
Heaven in its final breath
and God lose all control
Prayers for mercy cries for help
won't stop the blasphemy
Our troops emerge the sacred throne
and the victory is complete
Twilight burn across the sky
Time has come the doom is near
Stillness rules this cloudless night
Armageddon is here
Woe to you
Earth and Sea
TOTAL DESTRUCTION
12 days of total eclipse
Yet the stillness rules this night of mist
But slowly clouds of death are forming
The time has come to Reap
Burning skies
Battle cries
TOTAL DESTRUCTION
The end of mankind universe
So many battles yet to fight
Take heed forever learn
When the bells chime THE RETURN...
Screams of fear
The doom is here
TOTAL DESTRUCTION
Haunting the cloudless black sky
Braver at night
Hidden as the lips of her c*nt
She is keeping out of sight
Dark as her closed eyelids
Her secret
She comes to you with a serpent's kiss
She has the power to foresee
She don't fear the flames
She smile at the fire
Whisper the words of spell
Without fear without fright
She can't feel the pain
She gaze at the sky
In the greedy flames
She will burn tonight
The beauty burning
Like the moon at harvest
Her seared flesh falling apart
And feed the hungry flames
Where the flame still bite her thigh
She is not afraid to die
She will burn again tonight
She will always burn
But her spirit shall survive...
Praying to the wind to return
Chant the heat of infernal lightning
Gaze at the sky and its poisoned clouds
Listen for the sound of thunder
Now the tide has changed...
Stand on the cliffsedge alone in the night
My hair is blowing freely in the Wind
Fell so cold yet my yearn give me heat
Raise my head to the sky and breath in
Now the time is right...
It brings us curse, lust, hate, damnation and death
Wail through darkness and bring evil
It squall it screams
Satanas is present but yet he is unseen
THE WIND OF MAYHEM
She is open wide She isn't hard to please
She drives me f*cking wild I want her on her knees
She floats and insists I am hot and can't resist
She suck me to the core I now can't take no more
That Bitch
She turns me to a beast
BESTIAL LUST
C'mon Bitch
Each tendon muscle rippling She drink my sove with greed
She fuck my helpless body and she just raise the speed
She let her wet tongue roll I gasp and can't control
She is hot and drives me wild and still she is open wide
Just when this torture seems to end
She is there to drain my sove again
Come on ride, to ride on me bitch
BESTIAL LUST
Witching hour bad moon is on the rise
I can't resist its infernal cold power
When it blaze into my eyes
Feel I am slowly changing
Begin to lose my track
Hatred poison my veins
I am cold and my heart turns black
I am POSSESSED
I am trapped in its icecold blaze
It drains the warmth from my soul
Feel the dread and my mind is in torment
And still its eye of death glow so cold
I am confused
Feel my strength slowly fading
Oh hear my cries for help and mercy
I am POSSESSED
Crusted blood on altar black
The rite of dark is done
The semen burn in sacred flames
The Witches sings their song
The night is filled with joyous laughters
Orgy of the damned
Prepare for sacrifice by death
On my command
Infernal eternal
With the power in our veins
THE RITE OF DARKNESS
Candles glow with strength and glory
Blind the eye of sun
Demons rings the sabbath bell
The rite of dark is done
Naked bodies form the circle
Flesh and lust collide
Warm blood float and torrent faster
The wounds stands open wide
Sorcery blasphemy
Recite the words of spell
THE RITE OF DARKNESS deeds of hell
Hear the calls for your blood and flesh
Bells tolls it's time for your last breath
Writhe your body death is cold
Jaws claws sink their talons deep into your soul
The Wind squall through the vale of tears
Bring the smell of decayed flesh
Infernal lightning strikes the sky
Burn the bodies and poison your last breath
Hells wrath spawn this night of judgement
Flames of evil snatch the skies
From pits of pure damnation
Satan rise...
For all of you the bells toll...
Take heed...
THE REAP OF EVIL...
I was born in the light of a fullmoon
And baptised in the sacred blood of an angel
Raped the holy deity and slayed a new born child
I ride the wings of darkness and evil
I am the SON OF THE DAMNED and the wild
I lacerate your body I slit and tear your flesh
I got you in my vicious circle and poison your last breath
I make the damned earth quiver I make the heaven burn
I live in sin and lust and await lord Satan's Return...
In the blackened sky of twilight the Wind of Mayhem blow
Infernal lightning the sound of thunder roll
Endless nights on fire the Holocaust is near
Mist surround your destiny and the mortals runs with fear
I love to see you writhe in throe
The more you suffer my lust grows
I slit your throat and tear your flesh
My desire will be your death
SADIST Tormentor
I welter in blood I rape and slay
Stab sliver lacerate
so many lusts to satisfy
To still my hunger another must die
SADIST Tormentor
But now the sand of time is running out
I feel old

Can hear the bell toll
So week

Can hear my victims shout
Can't stand their cries their call
I gotta pay for my lusts...
They're dragging me down...
A sorcery written in blood
Whispered by a Witch in the dawn
Summon the darkness pure evil and death
And gather the legions of scorn
The darkness possesses you your soul scream in vain
Tonight the Hellfire shall burn
Thunder and lightning the ancient prediction
The bells chime for Satan's Return...
Blasphemy
Sorcery
It's the RETURN of the darkness and evil
It's the RETURN of the fire and flame
It's the RETURN of my master Satan

Sacrifice a virgin to the flames of burning Hell
Black Witch of beauty recite the words of spell
Gather masses run in circles scream for mercy cry of pain
No mercy for the blessed in Hell you all will burn in lord Satan's name
Now descend from the burning blasting sky
Holding the reigns ride the night

The raped souls of Heaven cries
Blasphemy
Victory
Desecration
Hell and damnation
It's the RETURN of the darkness and evil
It's the RETURN of the fire and flame
It's the RETURN of my master Satan
It's the RETURN of desire and pain
Down the vast hills in morning mist cold
Into the peaceful deep valley below
Twothousand stallions foaming with hate
Carrying their masters towards their fate
Into the battle they ride
Twothousand men too young to die
Massacre
Coming from each side prepared for attack
Covered in dustclouds now there is no turning back
Once so peaceful valley echoes with cries
Cascades of blood and brains as the midday sun rise
Under a bloodred sky
None will live to face the night
Massacre
Amidst the scattered limbs dead bodies finally comes to peace
While the stench of blood grows strong in the mild midday breeze
Circling the sky the vultures wait to play their part
To descend of wings of death and feast from human hearts
The battle is lost still someone always wins
And now they descend on death's black wings
Massacre
All dressed in gold and purple the beauty awaits the night
Knowing what will satisfy
Aware of Her delight
The thought of young fresh blood makes the hours go so slow
But the yearn for eternal life and beauty makes her hazelbrown eyes glow
Woman of Dark Desires
Woman of Eternal Beauty
Woman of Dark Desires
Now the hour is comed, the time is right for the feast to take its roll
And by the sunrise 60 bodies will be found raped from their blood and souls
The beauty patiently selects the victims for the night
Innocent blood will give eternal beauty eternal life
Woman of Dark Desires
Woman of Eternal Beauty
Woman of Dark Desires
Now the life you have lived have comed to light and unfold is your perversity.
Now the end is near still death is real
No more beauty or life for eternity
Cold walls entombs your secrets but there's nothing you regret
Embrace death with a smile as the highlands face sunset
Woman of Dark Desires
Woman of Eternal Beauty
Woman of Dark Desires
God of Heaven, Hear my cries of anguish
I'm in pain
I've suffered a thousand deaths but I live on in vain
Death would greet with eternal sleep
My soul would come to peace
My life had ceased
The time was comed
Can no-one hear my pleas
Lowered down in the moisty ground
Into the dark and cold
My heart's beat the only sound
Pain tears my limbs and soul
I scream for mercy
Hear my cries
Oh, Lord don't abandon me
I'm so tired
Grant me the eternal sleep
I tear at the lid I'm suffering
In a cold and nameless grave
If Hell is what awaits me
I feel no fright
Buried and forgotten
In a cold and nameless grave
If there's a God in heaven
Hear my call from the grave
Grant me the powers of thunder
And give me a sword forged in the raging Hell's fire
Lend me the eight legged black stallion of Odin and I'll have my vengeance,
I'll kill with desire
Vengeance flows like boiling poison through my twisted veins
Tonight I'll blood shed with wrath and set the night on flames
Invincible in battle, wargods hear my deathwish cry
I'll laugh in the face of death, I into glory ride
Snarling breath upon your backs, I'm vengeance incarnate
Now it's time, the moment's comed, stand up now, face my hate
See the fire in my eyes, the final light you'll see
I send you to the darkness with my sword of thunder and steel
I let the bodies lie in shame
I let mighty earth drink their blood
I turn my face to eternal sky
And praise my elders' God
Equimanthorn hear my Hail
You're the mighty four winds night and day
Steel in every warrior's heart and sword
The brave and wise in flesh and soul
Leave the world of mortals to walk into the mist to stalk unto the other side
Plains of otherness
The utter emptiness
Where time have ceased and dark and light collide
Crossing the river of death and water cold
Slowly walking up the bridge
The jewelled bridge I walk for what seems a lifetime
In the night it's jewels glow
There on the other side
On shore of no return
The one for me awaits
Cannot avoid the eyes
In which the fire burns
Comed this far it is too late
And He calls my name
First a whispering then louder
And he wants me to follow
And to Enter the Eternal Fire
I walk this endless night
His eyes the only light
Repeatedly he whispers my name
Fingers move and twist
Through crimson thick dark mist and voices cry of agony and pain
Close now to his kingdom
The bleak world dark and still
I follow the voice whispering my name
Approach the gate of sin
Opened up to let me in and there, He stand in flames
The price now I must pay for eternity my soul his claim
For years of pleasures, victory and gold
The one who stand in flames
Now rise and walk my way and reach out for my soul
And He calls my name
First a whispering then louder
And he wants me to follow
And to fall down. The Eternal Fire
I stand at the jaws of the pit
The heat scorch my flesh
The fall seem never to end
My hair burn
My eyes can't see
The flames slowly eat my soul
The pain tears my mind
Hear my cries oh Lord
Have mercy oh Lord
This can't be
Raging flames all over me
Inferno of heat
The damned earth commot under starspangled sky
As the sound of destruction increase
Tongues of red fire snatch black clouds above and unite with the cold Northern
breeze
A massive veil of flames raise high over the mountains and burning clouds fill
up the sky
Along vast hills liquid fire brim over
Tonight Hell's jaws open wide
Over the skyline
Approaching at high speed
Objects of flames reaching higher
Crossing the sky at Hell's pace comes a thousand Chariots of Fire
Chariots of fire emerge
Spreading pure hell on earth as they pass over water and land
All living to ashes turn
All creatures alive they burn
They die as they lay and stand
Vast hills on fire
Thick smoke dark sight
Ashes and death everywhere
Covered with ashes the bleak world lies dead as the chariots emerge the
poisoned air
Over the skyline
Approaching at high speed
Objects of flames reaching higher
Crossing the sky at Hell's pace comes a thousand Chariots of Fire
Now the night lays dark and cold
Upon a world at sleep
Across he world sweeps a crimson haze
Now the virgin's seal is broken
The fertility rite is complete
And the seed is sown in a holy place
Born a child of the underworld
The fire and flame
Born a child of the underworld
Desire and pain
Born a child of the underworld
Evil prevail
Born a child of the underworld
Now the day is slowly fading
The 12th night is comed
Prepare soon the virgin shall give birth
To the son of Satan, Child of Hell
Spread the news across the universe
Satan's child is born tonight by womb untouched and pure
All Hell rejoice the birth of the Son
Laced in sin
Child of Hell
The spirit of lust and pain
Baptised in sacred angel blood
Now Evil can prevail
Born a child of the underworld
The fire and flame
Born a child of the underworld
Desire and pain
Born a child of the underworld
Evil prevail
Born a child of the underworld
Orgy of silence
Conspiracy of peace
Only the sound
Of the cold northern breeze
Twinsun sink fading
Behind the black lake
Asleep is the mountains
Yet the night is awake
Strange is the night
Now black stars rise
And many moons circle
Through silent the night
Along the black mountainside scattered
By the campfires awaiting the dawn
Two times a hundred men in battles
Tried by the steel in the arrow axe and the sword
By battle worn hunger torn awaitening
For the sun to break through the cold haze
And for the banners of Ebal to appear
On the hill in the suns first warm rays
The elder among the men looked deep into
The fire and spoke loud with pride
Tomorrow is a fine day to die
Now the morning advance from far east
Now the sun breaks through dustclouds and haze
Now a forest of spears appears on the hill
And steel shines bright in the suns first rays
Die
Silent watching gaze
Across the blackened plains
Two eyes like burning embers
Awaits the moment for the
North star to blaze
Sythanagon winged
Angel rides deaths wind
To cloudless sky
And sound a summon call of war
Now burn does the skyline
Soundless wings lacerate the night
Angels of death emerge accross the sky
Thorned heads spiky limbs climb the air up high
Attack of the pearly gates
Now wait for the sign
Seen now is His star
Ablaze now risen in
The sign of the one with
A numbeer not a name
Now given is the sign
The Golden walls of heaven
Sound is given now of charge
A voice of war does cry
The cry does sound the signal
And the walls are stormed
Now fly
Swords are drawn in soundless flight
Above the walls of gold
The winged angels of death descend
A thousand from above
Now heaven is in its last throes of death
Sacred shrine of life and death
Apharamons gold key
The raping of holy interior
And all concealed
Now masturbated upon is throne of gold
Scattered battered wings
Along the palaces and streets
Trophy of the victory
Attached to spear of the Beast
Now spitted at is the scalp of God.
Oh I hit top speed
Still it's much too slow
The speed unconnect me
With the ground
Now it's too late
Just one way to go
If I'll die I'll die
To this bonecrushing sound
Can't slow it down
Now when the limit is so close
The yearn for the limit is too strong
Body and soul poisoned by speed overdose
And I know that I must go on at
Pace til death
Pace til death
Now the limit is so close
I can see its light beckon
And flicker before my eyes
Soon I'll be close enough
To reach out and touch
Or fail to raise speed
And slow down and die
Can't slow it down
Now when the limit is so close
The yearn for the limit is too strong
Body and soul poisoned by speed overdose
And I know that I must go on at
Pace til death
Limit, limit for you I'd die
At any pace at all
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fastest of them all
At dawn they rise pointing to the skies
Ready to cut through the clouds at command
From wombs in the ground born to deafening sounds
When the button is pressed by deaths hand
Loaded with death powered by the dragons breath
Climbing way above the clouds out of sight
To seek its destination and destroy it into void
And to spread its load of death and endless night
Below water in the ground on wings of steel up high
Seeds of death to be launched in final one of wars
Each with a number for a distant city at their sides
Wonder whats the number for my city and for yours
Metal phallous seeds of death
That is not won else cannot be lost
Precious burden seeds of death
Sown to earth brings the holocaust
Prepare to die
Now leaving their wombs all in fire baptised
Outnumbering the stars in the sky
Each with a skytrack on which they are sent
To destroy each part of the world on the other side
Not time to repent feel regret or ask for mercy
Once launched there is no way to bring them back
Finally the world created by man look so bright
Before it all turns black
Below water in the ground on wings of steel up high
Seeds of death to be launched in final one of wars
Each with a number for a distant city at their sides
Wonder whats the number for my city and for yours
Metal phallous seeds of death
That is not won else cannot be lost
Precious burden seeds of death
Holocaust
For all those who cried aloud
But whose tears were never heard
For questioning one almighty father
Of a heavenly distanced world
Beloved thee who submit
The holy writings assured
The golden cross stained with innocent blood
But stand yet a thousand heavenward
Burning naked but smiling
Not full of fear but pride
Knowing death alone could cleanse them
Of the reasons for which they all die
For all those who died
For all those whose great beauty
Stirred their tortures to rage
And for all those whose great ugliness
Did the same
For all those who cried aloud in vain
For mercy on the rack
But whom of dying naked in scorn
Not ashamed
Burning naked but smiling
Not full of fear but pride
Knowing death alone could cleanse them
Of the reasons for which they all died
For all those who died
Pleas for mercy signs of guilt
Naked bodies broken on the wheel
Tears sign the confession
With crusted blood lips sealed
Trial by water
Creed of eternal life I swore
Held my candle of life to the void
Risen from the dead I deaths powers wed
In the name of the one with horns on head
Sleep of eternity withdrawn as dark upon
The life of mine drew the very end so near
The price another life the gospel of the
Horned one to spread shore to shore
Eternally his words let hear
Be silent listen to the wind crying out the
Answer to all mankind call from other
Side speach of horned divine
To end your search in hope to find
As sure night divides the day and as sure day divides the night
Raging flames is allthat awaits us on the other side
Doomed the very moment he calls
See his star ablaze his children
On the night the flames reach for the sky
Night is comed to enter the never ending burning fire
Onto you all his word is given
Fear not reach to take his hand
Hear our master calling us his children
Eternal life is given death withdrawn
As wolves among sheep we have wandered
Victory lies beyond their spit and scorn
Even the heavens shall burn when we are gathered
Now when the flames reach for the sky
Deaths star on horizon
Lightning and rain
Black winds and thunder
The skyline is in flames
Written in the red mist
The sign of the one
Who rides deaths cold wind
And walks disguised among
All you vagrant souls
Of profane disbeliefs
False prophets and deceivers
Shall swing from the trees
Soon the dawn shall arise
For all the opressed to arm
A chariot of thunder shall be seen
And bronze horns shall sound the alarm
Fists will raise like hammers
To a cloudy black sky
Bonds and chains fall to the ground
Children of all slaves
Stand united and proud
All people of bondage shall triumph
And live by the sign of
Blood Fire Death
The moment is chosen
The Battlefield is bare
Take now thy stand people
The true ones don't fear
Now choose your weapons
And fall in the line
Choose well your colours
And follow the sign
Blood for all tears shed
And Fire for hate
Death for what shall become
All false ones fate
The standard bearer is chosen
And the day has just begun
Shadows growing long by the rising
Of the awakening sun
Fists raise like hammers
To a clear sunny sky
Bonds and chains fallen to the ground
Children of all slaves
Now united and proud
All people of bondage now triumph
And live by the sign of
Blood Fire Death
Children of all slaves
Unite be proud
Rise out of darkness and pain
A chariot of thunder and gold
Will come loud
And a warrior of thunder and rain
With hair as white as snow
Hammer of steel
To set you free of your chains
And to lead you all
Where horses run free
And the souls of the ancient ones reign
Mother winter leaves our land
And opens wide the seas
The lukewarm breeze does beckon me
As it whispers through the trees
It says: Set your sails
And let me take your ship to foreign shores
Take farewell of those near you
And your land of the North!
The wild cold deep black ocean's waves
Invites my hungry heart
Cry not my love I'll return
Only death can keep us apart
Odin in the sky up high
Let the Ravens of yours fly
To guide us on our sail to foreign shores
Let your Ravens fly
The wind blows through my hair
And fills our sails with hope and pride
Caress these lines of Oak, wind
Do not throw us all aside
The wild cold deep black ocean's waves
As wide as sky above
Carry us, oh, Gods of sea
Don't take us down below
Now approach the shore at dawn
All is still the light of daybreak is yet to be born
Clad in morning dew asleep
The city's walls rise before us men from the seas
Carrying cold steel at our sides
No time to lose at sunbirth we attack the city by surprise
Down the coastlines with the wind we reign
Men of the North we leave the shores in flames
Shores in Flames 
Shores in Flames
Fire!
Tor of thunder way up high
Swing your Hammer that cracks the sky
Send the wind to fill our sails and take us home
Guide your sons, us, home
When the wind cries out my name
And time has come for me to die
Then wrap me in my cape
And lay my sword down at my side
Then place me on a ship of Oak
And let it drift with tide
Let the flames purify my soul
On its way to hall up high
Up high
Fire!
Fire and Ice
There is a serpent in every Eden
Slick as grease and cold as ice
There is a lie in every meaning
Rest assured to fool you twice
In this age of utter madness
We maintain we are in control
And ending life before deliverance
While countries are both bought and sold
Holy writtings hokus-pokus
Blaze of glory and crucifix
Prepried costly credit salvations
Don't trust nobody
It will cost you much too much
Beware of the dagger
It caress you at first touch
Oh, all small creatures
It is the twilight if the gods
When the foundations to our existence
Begins to crumble one by one
And legislations protects its breakers
And he who was wrong but paid the most won
Even the gods of countless religions
Holds no powers against this tide
Of degeneration because we have now found
That there is no thrones up there in the sky
Run from this fire
It will burn your very soul
Its flames reaching higher
Comed this far there is no hold
Oh, all small creatures
It is the twilight if the gods
Twilight of the gods
For as long as the grass grows
For as long as the stream flows
And the sun shines down unto us
Only they who walks the clouds knows
For how long the wind blows
And the sky is blue above us
Oh, I am a man and I hold in my hand my fate
Free as the wind as if even
I had wings that carried me
Still in the middle of the night
Even I will need light to guide me
So I turn my face to the sky from
Where he with one eye is watching over me
Through blood by thunder
Sound of wings in the air and
his ravens fly near to lead me
So I will not fail to ride down the trail
long time destined for me
long before I was born
That a son of the north must forfill
his destined course to
follow the bond of blood
Oh, so it is written son
When all waters and land you see
All around came to birth
Man and beast was one
And the gods of the sky
Walked the face of the earth
Few free and innocent
Man strolled paths next to those
Of beasts seeing no signs
But stars in the sky
Knowing of day and night
Of rain and winds, hunger and fright
But not of death nor of life
While all was at ease with all
The story tells of stormy skies
Black clouds gathered up high
And of lightning striking from a
Burning bloodred sky
The mountains crumbled to the seas
Earth shook the worlds collide
Ending the age of gods
Giving birth to our time
And man lived and learned
The secret of steel
Ore of earth
fire of sky
Forged is blade of gods
Blood and iron Blood and iron
So the age to learn and to teach
for man begins, the power to know
the blood and iron discipline, and
tell the story of how man was granted
these shining blades of steel
Knowing of the past she will know
of the tomorrow and man shall reign, yes,
even conquer other worlds and she will set
sails on her starships sailing across the
black space and become the new gods of the skies.
Blood and iron.
In great numbers we advance before dawn
By the great hail this great fight is born
Among the clouds now our black wings fills the air
No more frontlines the holy battle is everywhere
Though death may await me on the battlefield
I die to go on but by the great hail I will go,
I am marching under the runes
Countless victories we fight side by side
Deep down in the oceans on land and way up in the sky
Comed this far now there is no way back or return
If we do withdraw the horizon will seem to burn
Though death now is closing in on me
I die to go on but by the great hail I will go,
I am fighting under the runes
Standing here now amidst the hell we have made
All signs of a wonder or to survive now seems to fade
But I am a fighter and I still have my pride
They are gonna have to kill, by my own hand I refuse to die
Though now death is all that awaits me
I die to go on but by the great hail I will go
I am dying under the runes
Blind fools who see only what they tell you to
Open up your eyes you might see it too
See there is a lot to see within you too
Don't be like the rest and let them take it from you
Dumb fools who say only what they tell you to
Speak up and find that there is more truth within you than you knew
Somewhere someday you will stand before it too
Trust me there is a never ending mountainside to climb for you too
To enter your mountain
Go into your mountainside
To enter one's mountainside
Will take its man
Who enters his mountain
With or without sword in hand
Who enters his mountainside
He will learn
Deaf fools who hear only what they tell you to
Open up your ears you might hear it too
Listen there is a wild storm within you too
Burst out use its powers don't be a
Damn fool how can you follow paths not made by nor for you
The only way you will ever need to walk is right there for you
Somewhere someday you will stand before it too
Trust me there is a never ending mountainside to climb for you too
To enter your mountain
Go into your mountainside
To enter one's mountainside
Will take its man
Who enters his mountain
With or without sword in hand
Who enters his mountainside
He will learn
He who enters his mountain
He who enters his mountain
Into one's mountainside
Father who are in the sky
Hold thy hand above me
Mighty is the raging waves
On which I ride
Mother who awaits me ashore
Let your golden hair down
It will shine and guide me
Through the raging storm
Heading north after long a journey
We have sailed for so very long
Heavy seas endless sky above us
Heading north going home
Brother who fell in foreign land
Blessed thy soul a warriors
Living on through your sword
Now in my hand
Sister who for my return sings
Shed no more tears for my well
I can hear your voice clear now
In the wind
Heading north after long a journey
We have sailed for so very long
Heavy seas endless sky above us
Heading north going home
Heading north after long a journey
We have sailed for so very long
Heavy seas endless sky above us
Heading north going home
Watch me, I bleed now no more
My wounds one thousand and crisp
as life itself it drips away
a smile upon my lips
Cutting, slicing, carving
the blade slides deep in me
running warm blood
leaving my corps to be
Convulsions shatters my carved limbs
I now begin to feel the chill
the smile remains upon my lips
because likewise I die I kill
Crimson vision, inspiration
now it is time to ink my pen
and to summon my last strenght
to write my requiem
Covered in my own blood
words and music comes to me
now more dead than living
I compose in harmony
My blood forms notes on paper
splattered up and down the lines
creative even in death
I still smile as I die
The crucifix in flames
The house of God burned down to the ground
A symbolic action of defiance
Brought palace of lies down
Refusal to acknowledge the authority
Of faith of liars
Has cleansed this world somewhat
By purifying lovely fire
Holy writtings
Magic incense, blood and tears
Impeccable the ways of Heaven
To inflict terror and fear
All are born of woman
And the female is of sin
So we are all drenched soaky wet in sin
When our life begins
And for the rest of our days
To reach his kingdom full of bliss
We seek forgiveness
For something we didn't do
To someone who does not and never has
And never will exist
Cross of lies, no one up high
Gayhood of priests and spartan fiests
Pathetic faith, your wine and bread
All will be well once we're all dead
He might have died for
Somebody's sins but sure not mine
If all you want is to him follow
And die too then I say fine
But don't you baptise one more
Generation in some fuckin' shame
Supported by that damned religion
Of yours I now watch in flames
I will always defy your damn faith
As I've lived I'll die free
You'll never have me crosstitute myself
Or on my fuckin' knees
Trembling soft skin wrapping
shuddering warm flesh
blood pulsating through the veins
Tool insertion
science not perversion
the end result justifies the pain
Twisted human flesh
lovely smell of death
the sight of naked skin
the treasures deep within
The colour of the blood
every curve and cavity
morbid fuckin' lust
smell of death is what I need
Don't you mind the never ending
fucking killing aich
just you think of what a damned
good looking corpse you'll make
Substances injected
glands and blood infected
gasolin and peroxide
Sharp cold steel cuts through the skin
revealed is the within
the chest is open wide
Twisted human flesh
lovely smell of death
the sight of naked skin
the treasures deep within
The colour of the blood
every curve and cavity
morbid fuckin' lust
smell of death is what I need
Sliced down into the finest
see-through shiny meat red leafs
you have proven how damn beautyfull
a corpse can be
desict, sliver and maim
pincer and razorblade
Samples, jars, neat labels
plastic bags and containers
photographs of every slain
Twisted human flesh
lovely smell of death
the sight of naked skin
the treasures deep within
The colour of the blood
every curve and cavity
morbid fuckin' lust
smell of death is what I need
To wash the blood off
of my damned hands
to get them realy clean
I'd need to fuckin' wash them endlessly
Burning limbs and deformed steel
The shells cuts through the sky
The corpses fills the the endless fields
It's shoot to kill or die
The gas pours in like yellow mist
You die in kneedeep mud
You sink into that fuckin' smudge
Stichy from all the fuckin' blood
Medals, salutes, uniforms and eyes-left
Promotion, honour, glory then death
Tons of steel is pumped across
The burnin' no-mans land
You dig your face deep into the shit
And wait for the command
For medal, your King and country
Will crave the loss of limbs or eyes
For honour you'll need to give
General Death your fuckin' life
Ladders by the hundreds
Firmly placed among the dead
Leading to the hell
That rages on above your head
By the thousands you will run
Into that fire zone
Your God and King is with you
But you'll fuckin' die alone
Medals, salutes, uniforms and eyes-left
Promotion, honour, glory then death
The altar covered
in lifegiving cum
the smell of
forever running wet cunts
Flesh and sweat
dancing bare limbs around the fire
the sound of clashing
wet bodies and sighs
Dry throats and warm blood
the rite, the collecting of sperm
and milk from young breasts
Lust instead of Gods
on the altar of masturbating
fuckin' human flesh
Wet limbs lie down
to dry in the wind
sumbols painted with blood
on bare skin
Earth now nourished
with milk and with cum
celebration of nature
is done
Come sun and gentle rain
our gift is made
so that the soil can give birth
The sead and milk remains
in the domains of the deep womb
of mother Earth
It's full of doubts and questions
Did you really raise the dead?
Are you really so pathetic
That you can't be critisised?
Is it so hard to accept
That I may wonder why?
Out of nothing, born by no one
Wonders you create
Almighty fuckin' God
You super bluff, you mega-fake
They say you've said for you only
We all shall live and die
Tell me who needs Stalin
With a fascist in the sky?
Conquering the western hemisphere
With threats and lies
Spreading its holy terror
As another culture dies
It baptised and it burned and tortured
Its way through my land
And wielded above all
The crucifix by God's command
Imposing on the tribes of Europe
One faith built on lies and dreams
One religion so false
Always loose at every seam
Through wars and emigration
Soon a world faith took its form
As world saviour and almighty
The cross all world adorned
Computerised confessions
Kill me!
I am but a fuckin' livin' dead
Help me!
I am goin' outta this damn head
Crazy!
I can't stand the agony and aich
A helpless fuckin' vegetable
I feel I suffocate
Suffocate
Suffocate
By and by I tighten the loop
laid around my neck
stretching that damn rope some more
like some damn fuckin' pet
I am like a book
that never will be read
this damn body's outside live
but inside I am dead
Karma!
I don't give a fuck for what will be
I shit upon what will come
when the lights gone out for me
Suffocate
Suffocate
I chew my fuckin' limbs
frustration fills all cavitys
living brings me closer
to hardcore insanity
Just one fuckin' step
all'll be fuckin' over and done
I've been taking this one step
since my damn life fuckin' begun
Seeing this whole fuckin' life
like some damn fuckin' trap
I'll be laughin' 'till I hear
that final fuckin' snap
System the crocked cross
the code yellow star
machinery of death will grind
the trains keep on rolling
both nearby and far
the cargo is of Abrahams kind
Gasping for air
in the stench and the heat
losing track of the number of days
only the cramped space
keeps people afeet
while all hope vanishes like a haze
All comes to hault
and the doors slam wide open
then all are called out on the ground
a sweet sour smell
fills all lungs on the platform
the roar of the death machine sounds
Phallos of death
giant chimneys arise
spewing ashes and fire way high
the disciplin of racial purity
the code by which you all
fuckin' must die
Distinguish to Kill
Distinguish to Kill
Shiny black leather boots
peaked caps in grey
sporting the deaths head mean grin
yellow star patch
and pink triangle displayed
numbers inked into bear skin
Rows of barbed wire
high voltaged in miles
ensurance to kill all last hope
the only way out of this hell is to go
through the chimney
like thick burning smoke
Burning the bodies
the owens glow white
as the heat cracks the skulls open wide
bodily human fluids joins the melted fat
running down the collecting pipes
Now grinding the piles
of burned bones to powder
the system perfected and complete
all to attain and remain in purity racialy
the wheels turn in deaths industry
Now that the virgin bitch
breastfeads death
and the winds smell strong
of the dragons breath
And all the stars fall down
like fuckin' rain of fire
there will be souls for sale
but only one damned buyer
Hey, is this the planet of apes?
Endless chewing on sour grapes
Or the age of eclipse?
The coming of the Apocalypse?
Drugs and pills
there's no oil in Vucovar
when a one night stand kill's
no matter who you are
When the Earth cries loud
but not a damn thing is heard
and a pussy is an asset
in this fuckin' world
When the blood runs down
mother Nature's thighs
and the TV-preacher is caught
while jerking off before Christ
And an audience pay's
just to fuckin' gloat
how the bitch is cut wide open
from her cunt to her throat
Hey, is this the planet of apes?
Endless chewing on sour grapes
Or the age of eclipse?
The coming of the Apocalypse?
Hey, is this the planet of apes?
Endless chewing on sour grapes
Or the age of eclipse?
The coming of the Apocalypse?
Sixteen years of age. 
The suburb sets the scene.
Sixteen years of rage withheld and concealed.
Doors locked. 
Curtains drawn. 
Rehearsals begins.
Preparations made. 
The axe gets a final trim.
Shadowed figures came at night. 
The hands would clutch and strike his thighs. 
The kid would not even be weeping. 
This kid pretending he's sleeping.
Kept within his young strained mind all this damn time.
Not a hint at what grew steadily inside.
The hate during prayer at supper and the surpressed at school. 
The need to be able to strike back grew.
Memories of fingers penetrating. 
Years of terror generating emotions functioning as fuel
when this kid walks down his parents room.
Parts of bodies found. 
The blood splattered all around
The result of the hate unleashed. 
Just one shot was heard.
This suburb neighbourhood disturbed. 
This pained mind has found peace. 
In the backyard. 
Shotgun at his side.
Difficult to identify. 
Sixteen years of age and dead.
Sixteen years of rage to an end.
I am not of Jesus Christ I'm not
and I am not a Satanic Child I'm not
and I know not no property of high or low
and I know where I come from and whereto I will go
Rat race and symbols. 
Crucifix and flesh.
Politics and fashion. 
Religion and death.
I am just a human being I am
and I am another mortal piece of meat.
Yet I am too fast and alive for you to hand no sign on me.
Holy writings. 
Tax and Law. 
Angel wings or frying.
Suicides no use at all.
We're all born to die.
I am not no more a sinner or saint than fucking all of you.
I am no more close or far away from the truth.
I am no believer or receiver of holy or unholiness.
I want to kill you and share with you my pain.
And if it thrills you I'll gladly kill again.
I want to maim you. 
Your throat a bleeding well.
And before your damned body's cold you're already in hell.
This is my anger. 
My hurt and my hate.
This is my fucking despair.
This is my inside. 
My thorn and my ache.
This is my grind and my tare.
I want to tie you up. 
Make you beg for release.
I'll whip your body beyond sense. 
Cut you down piece by piece.
I want to rape you. 
I'll leave you bleed in death.
This is my lust and my distorted needs.
This is my wrath and my pain.
This is my kind. This is my creed.
This is my body and brain.
This is my anger. My hurt and my hate.
This is my fucking despair.
This is my inside. Mt thorn and my ache.
This is my grind and my tare.
This is my lust and my distorted needs.
This is my wrath and my pain.
This is my kind. 
This is my creed.
This is my body and brain.
Kill. 
Kill them all. 
Pigs written in blood on the walls.
Your not entitle to accuse and judge one single man
if you allow all shit that's happening in this damned rotten land. 
The pressure your damned system,
religion and school puts on our minds creates an all
collective pain that no damn walls can keep inside.
Do you really think that all evil and madness rests in me.
Do you think you're safe locking me up
and then throwing away the key.
Can't you see I'm out, man. 
Can't you see I'm free.
Can't you see I'm out, man. 
Can't you see I'm just
a product of a broken nation's shattered dream.
Death. 
Death to all. 
Pigs screaming, 
The blood runs down the walls. 
You'll never be successful trying to
keep the madness behind these walls because the pain
comes from inside and creates chaos within all.
You can put me in the chair and watch me fucking fry.
But I am aware my death's a nation's alibi.
Can't you see I'm out, man. 
Can't you see I'm free.
Can't you see I'm out, man. 
Can't you see I'm just
a product of a broken nation's shattered dream.
Kill. 
Kill them all. 
Freedom of speech and that of information.
To gather in prayer and for demonstrations.
Freedom to choose. 
Freedom found driving a car.
To posess a remote control and the right to arm.
Voices talk from inside.
Unemployment and touchdown. 
Holy book full of lies.
Suicidal intentions. 
There's no kingdom up high.

Conservatism. Communism. Paganism. Nationalsocialism

Cocained soft drink containers.
Amusement and passion.

Need I say there's a lot of shit on the hill.
But it all fits in the grave. 
Somewhat more darkness and chill.
Sociopath. Psychopath. Autograph. Schizofrenia. Empathy.
Biography. All humanity. Majority. Minority. But then
regardless of which it's a fucking damn assorted century.

Chained to the log. 
Handcuffed and drugged.
Still pain is all you feel.
A piece of meat that hardly breathes.
Still much a human being.
Forcing his way into your ass.
Flesh will rip and bloody will flow.
This death comes in your rear.
One of 33 something.
All who were raped and bled.
Drink my cum. 
Take my rum.
Blooded hole. 
Twisted soul.
Eat my shit. 
Suck my dick.
Writhe in pain and die insane.
With every breath inhale the stench
of lubrication shit and sweat.
The smell of love the smell of human
blood and excrement.
there's no way out. 
No release.
In the attic is all hell, 
then in the basement you'll find peace.

I'm but a shell. 
A frame of a man. 
I'm but a glimpse of whom I used to be. 
I'm no more life and lust.
I'm only rich on time to spend venting my own spleen.
I'm sick as hell. 
I am in desperate need of heeling.
Need to feel salvation. 
Or I might as well embrace death.
I could never stand a world of sin and fornication.
The world is full of whores. 
All this filth and heresy.
I am a tool of the Lord. 
I have eternal life.
The will of God was executed through my deeds.
The voice of God I heard. 
All filth and unclean I disintegrated to prepare Gods paradise in this world.
I read the holy writings. 
And I realised what had to be done.
And that I just had so little time.
The world is so full of sin. 
Blasphemy and sacrilege.
For as I believe in him. 
I have eternal life after death.
What have I done so wrong. 
Why have they put me in this place without no windows. 
I'm no more life and lust.
I'm only rich on time to spend venting my own spleen.
The world is so full of fools. 
Vagrant souls and lustful flesh.
But as I believe in him. 
I have eternal life after death.

You can't shut it out. 
With every breath reality.
This is the key. 
Objection of history. 
Now all that remains...
The judgement of posterity.
Toxic waste. Debris. 
On land, in the air and at sea.
You can't shut it out. 
With every breath reality.
This is the key. 
Objection of history. 
Now all that remains...
The judgement of posterity.
The old Crow's cry the first warning
The rumbling frozen ground the last.
Hooves thundering on the three feet snow,
The icy dawn yet to begin.
Bursting through the icy morning four times five black shadows ahorse.
Steel glimmering in the awakening sun's light,
And blood colours the white snow red.
Cries echo through the dark deep woods.
Open wounds steam in the cold morning air,
And the new day was greeted with a burden
both raped and dead.
Long scalps hung by the old twin headed Beast's standard black.
Women and children brought far north into the land of no turning back
The burning village spread by the wind across the tundra
Cry old Crow cry.
Long tall beautiful people fallen lifeless to the ground
Headless scattered still graceful bodies.
Blood coloured the white snow all around.
Through the dark deep woods to the mountains towering to the sky
The wind carries the quest for revenge and the tale of Blood on Ice.
The Eternal deep dark Woods...
Late daytime...
I have paced these forests for so long I don't know if I am man or I am beast.
I, though, hold deep within me a quest for revenge.
Then I must be a man as much as I can be.
I have learned to speak the tongue of the animal
I have learned to read the signs in bark and snow.
I have taken within myself the spirits of my fathers,
long time gone.
In this short time, far from home, a man of Iron I've grown.
A man of Iron I have grown.
A part of the Eternal Woods...
Late evening...
one eyed old man, You who see it all.
You who see the past and all to be
Say, ye one eyed old man. 
For I need to know.
Tell me which path fate has chosen for me.
Say does the Northstar still shine on me.
Say will I set my loved ones free.
one eyed old man. 
Of ye our elders told.
You have been since land and sky was one.
And if you really know all that will be, tell me,
what the future wants with this young no-one's son.
Say does the Northstar still shine on me
What do you see in store for me....
Questions, questions. 
Many you ask.
About the future and some of the past.
Few have seen what I see. 
Fewer still will ever know.
I gave an eye to see better.
And your thirst for knowledge grows.
But you, my child, who treads the road of pain.
Who have felt such anger. 
Such that bears no name,
Thee shall I nurse as if you were my own son.
And this very night your training will already have begun.
For I have seen you come for a thousand years or so.
And the gods have told me to teach you all that I possess and know
And though my eye no longer sees my hand held out in front of me,
I still gaze crystal clear at all that mortal man cannot see.
And I see you riding up on a stallion as white as snow.
With the speed of the winds and endurance untold.
And you wield a sword of steel forged in fire and ice.
And the cry of a warrior you sound
and victory is in your eyes.
Hear me my son, for you are the chosen one....
An icy cave in a mountain...
Bright morning...
This sword of steel that I hold in my hand
Ore of this mountain. 
A sword of this land.
Made for a king when the elders were young.
To guard us and to guide us in an age since long gone.
A sword to protect the peace in troubled times.
A sword made to battle and to take a life.
This sword is the backbone of the life that I know.
Here among the mountains and snow.
This sword will be one with me. Body and soul.
All of me will be delivering each blow.
Slung on my back. 
Oh it's powers I feel.
I can hardly wait to try it's steel.
A sword to protect the peace in troubled times.
A sword made to battle and to take a life.
This sword is the backbone of the life that I know.
Here among the mountains and snow.
Behold it's sharp beauty. 
Just look at it's shine.
This sword was forged in fire and ice.
This sword is the backbone of the life that I know.
Here among the mountains and snow.
Now I am ready
To let this old sword sing again.
Atop a snowcovered hill...
Just before sunset...
Tendons and muscles of steel.
And the blaze of lightning in its eyes.
White as the snow on the hills.
And it's reins, that I hold, they are mine.
This stallion and sword in exchange
for my heart and both of my eyes.
The ravens of swift wings my sight
Surely now victory must be mine.
Eight legged stallion of mine.
Run with the speed of the winds.
Eight legged stallion I stride.
Run as if you carried wings.
I paint thee with the blood from my veins
Images of origin long lost.
I adorn your white mane and tail
With the stars that fell from the sky.
A glade in the Eternal deep dark Woods...
Midnight hours...
Resting by my fire. 
Looking deep into it's flames.
My mind must have been somewhere else
Far beyond these plains.
I am suddenly aware of a pair of eyes staring at me.
I turn around and behold the most ugly thing I have seen.
The woman standing in the glade like a shadow in the night
Points her wretched finger at me with a wretched smile
And she asks me in a voice that sounds as if it's been so long
since she spoke, if I seek magic then I should come along
I'm but a man. 
Mortal, a man.
But she leaves no footprints in the snow
Still I follow on to where she is going
For she has promised me magic if I follow on.
She takes me to a part of these woods few have ever seen.
Where the sun surely won't reach
Still the ground ominously gleams.
She says she's seen me coming and that she knows where I'll go.
But before I leave she says there is this one thing I should know.
She offers me the ability to take a fatal wound.
Every cut by sword or spear will be absorbed by her tree-womb.
The magic will remain until it's time for me to part with this mortal world.
And all she'll claim is my young heat.
I'm but a man. 
Mortal, a man.
And I'll need all the help that I can get.
So I give my heart to the woman of the dark
With or without it...
my life is not over yet.
Wing of bat and lizard's eye.
Dust of a star fallen from the sky.
Tears of a virgin, *** of a god.
Thirteen drops of an infant's blood
A twist of a cat's spit and oil of the moon
Stir for a while and very soon
A salve to be applied upon the chest
close to where the heart beats strong.
No pains will occur when her hand is pushed into my flesh
She'll slowly draw my living heart out of my open chest.
She'll place my heart in the pit of the snake and behold the years go by.
Hers to keep from the moment when the time has come for me to die.
By a lake in an open part of the Eternal Woods...
Noon...
The one eyed old man told me that the face that I will see
Has paralysed a thousand brave men sure of victory
I cannot fight blindfolded and I'd freeze if I should see.
So I need to sacrifice my eyes to see all from within.
The one eyed old man told me of a lake that no-one knows of.
where the end of the sky unites with the bottom countless feet down deep
And he told me when this world was young into it's depths his eye he had thrown
So that though one eyed, he could see more than can be seen.
I'll throw my eyes into the lake.
So that I will see from within
I'll throw my eyes into the lake
And when blind I will still see.
At the bottom of the lake.
My two eyes will shine like the stars
At the bottom of the lake
I will see no matter how near or far
Regardless at which speed my horse
takes me through the night
No matter how sharp the blade of my sword seems to be.
Even with the aid of two pair of eyes way up high
In the end before the Beast, it's face I would have had to see.
But with my two eyes in the depths my vision is supreme
I see all things that can't be seen
but not my hand that is held out in front of me.
The face that makes me freeze
I now need not see at all.
I'll feel the presence of the Beast.
but will not need stare him down no more.
I've thrown my eyes into the lake.
So that I will see from within
I've throw my eyes into the lake
And now when blind I still see.
At the bottom of the lake.
My two eyes are shining like the stars
At the bottom of the lake
I now see no matter how near or far
Creator of life. 
Guardian of the dead.
Goddess of battle and war,
All of ye watch me. 
My sword by my side.
Proudly I sit on my horse.
And I wait for the sign in the sky to appear.
telling me that the moment has come
For me to ride beyond the edge of this world
into the realms where the shadows are strong
Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain
Valkyries my soul is yours should I fail.
Let my beheaded and battered corpse lay
and take me where you bring all nordsmen slain.
Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain.
Hugin and Munin my eyes in the sky.
Heart of mine thrown in the pit of the snake
I will not need no heart where I go should I die.
Realms of the shadows bring me no fear
I may stand or be beaten and torn
The mountains will stand. 
But the life of a man was decided long before he was born.
Leaving the plains where my ancestors hunted
for meat and for hides against the cold.
Here the fire was tamed. 
Here our sword were made.
And here the elders amazing takes told
I ride into land few have seen or returned from
to tell of it's bleakness and dark
I see nothing but mist and the mountains so tall
I can't tell them and the sky apart
Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain
Valkyries my soul is yours should I fail.
Let my beheaded and battered corpse lay
and take me where you bring all nordsmen slain.
Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain,
Hugin and Munin my eyes in the sky.
Heart of mine thrown in the pit of the snake
I will not need no heart where I go, should I die.
Realms of the shadows bring me no fear
I may stand or be beaten and torn
The mountains will stand. 
But the life of a man was decided long before he was born.
Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain
Valkyries my soul is yours should I fail.
Let my beheaded and battered corpse lay
and take me where you bring all nordsmen slain.
Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain.
Hugin and Munin my eyes in the sky.
Heart of mine thrown in the pit of the snake
I will not need a heart where I go, should I die.
Steadily on jagged wings
Feather black against the burning sky
Spread your wings and ride the wind
Gaze down on me with blackest eyes.
Fly my ravens, fly ahead.
Over the mountains and endless sky
Fly my ravens, fly ahead
Over the mountains over my head.
Let the wind carry you up high.
Fly my ravens, it's time to fly,
And for me maybe to die.
Valley of Death in the land of no return...
The moment of glory or death...
Fifteen years have passed
Every day the woods have cried
the words of vengeance and revenge.
The Gods have watched him day and night
by the Northern stars bright light.
Growing stronger. 
Coming nearer.
Upon a steed as white as snow
he is riding through this land of no return
His hair blowing in the wind
A sword in his hand.
And his eyes they burn.
Guide me, my Ravens. 
Find the way through the woods and snow
Let your eyes be mine seeking for the valley of death
Come this far, I am willing to face the twin-headed beast's breath
Let your wings be my heart
in the air, black as night.
I have steel at side. Powers of thunder
The Gods with me ride
I trust in my ravens, watching from above
Black as night. 
Swift as lightning,
and graceful as doves.
I trust in my Stallion. 
Born by the wind,
Taking me through the valley
where this world ends, and the shadows begin
I trust in my sword. 
Forged in fire and ice.
It's sharp blade shall be baptised in blood
as I take the Beast's life.
Cry, old crow, cry...
Come out of the darkness you beast of Hell, face me.
Out on this field of moonlit snow.
I will not be deterred by your ugliness.
Before my sword your two heads will roll.
I will not let my sword rest until it's steel
has song for your ugly twin heads.
I'll wipe the sweat off my face with your bloody scalps
and watch your four eyes telling me that you're dead.
Gathering speed. 
Charging forward.
collision is close now.
The swords are drawn, held high.
they flash in the pale blue moonlight.
aiming at throats bare. 
The moment is so near
The time seems to halt for a while
Even the stars in the sky hold their breath
This is the moment of glory or death...
The moment to maim or to be put to rest...
So close now I almost can hear the black blood
in the beast's thick veins pumping.
I am swinging my sword. 
May the Gods be with me.
I ride out through the vast portals of Hel.
I swing my sword in the air.
And the dead beast's two bloody scalps attached to a spear.
Now is come the moment for me to set free
those, a long time ago, brought far north
by the twin-headed beast.
On that daybreak when the old crow did cry...
That hard winter when I, still a child...
By my Father was told of a hall way above the clouds,
Gates open wide for the one who dies with sword in hand.
Twinkle bright Aldebaran, the star of solitude
Somewhere there is a lake of fire, pity all the fools
Sorry are the desolate, the unfree and obedient
For this is not the spring of love, it is the winter of discontent
Standing at the shore of lake of fire
Standing at the shore of Lake Of Fire
Blood mooney, for thirty pieces of silver
You shall buy yourself the time
The quivering meat conception, deflorate the virgin fair
Succumb to your own passion, receive the garland made from angel's hair
Crown yourself, 
the thorns will cut you, 
bleed your majesty
But by dawn it will all satisfy no more, 
dethrones you weep
Dumped along the shore of lake of fire
Dumped along the shore of Lake Of Fire
So you've been left in chains to rot away in your own stinking rest
You'll hang till death in your own entrails
What you're gonna do, peasants with nukes
But death you'll see shall make us free
A flash like the birth of a sun
A pillar of virgin fire
Now glowing a ruby cloud
The finger of death reaching higher
Radiant dust a chimney rise
Desert floor dissolved wide ablaze
Golden plum against the midnight sky
Burning eyes in death clouds ashgrey face
I have harnessed the stars
Now unleashed upon the earth
I am become death
The Destroyer Of Worlds
Encased in lead and steel
The end and infinity
The eight moon the sixth day the year death
The heatwave to grasp and consume your last breath
Brought high on R marked silver wing
Afar in cold thin morning air
Below as the day begins
The burning eyes in deaths face greedily stares
I have harnessed the stars
Now unleashed upon the earth
I am become death
The Destroyer Of Worlds
When I'm gone and my time had come to shut these eyes of mine
No stones must be erected I will leave but ash behind
Tell no tales about me when you gather around your fire
I'll be one with mother earth not dining in no hall up high
I have no master I swear no oath
The gods may pass me by
I steer the horse I choose to mount
When the storm draws near and the blood rain from the sky
One life hardly a notch made in the bark of tree of time
One death hardly a drop of blood on the reapers shiny scythe
I take not a thing with me where I will go on the day I die
When my star has ceased to shine, but in a shallow hole I'll lie, I'll lie
Nobody died for my sins
No faith tied to my name
The path I choose to walk is mine
When the clouds turn red and the horizon as in flames
My blood my heart my soul my hands my feet
My hair and eyes my head my lips and teeth
My arms my legs my cock my choice and life
My loungs my mind till the day I die
Blood Blood Blood
Voltures soaring high above me waiting to descend
To sink their claws into my fucking flesh and to rip myself apart
Leeches slimy creatures drain me bone dry and leave me to die
On my knees and sliced to pieces badly beaten cut and bleeding
It's not for you that I'm bleeding
It's not for you it's not for you that I bleed
Swollen the vein your pleasure my pain
The blade to the skin and the sapping begins
So powerful red and soon I'll be dead
The smell makes you high and blood is life
Break my fucking bones and squeeze my head you want me dead
Crush my fingers tear my flesh leave me laying waiting for death
Parasiting vermin biting ugly features faceless creatures
Rob me of my very soul and try to push me down your hole
It's not for you that I'm bleeding
It's not for you it's not for you that I bleed
Swollen the vein your pleasure my pain
The blade to the skin and the sapping begins
So powerful red and soon I'll be dead
The smell makes you high and blood is life
Death once walked this relic land
He came while all would sleep
Death held up his bony hand
And with it death did sweep
Across all land and water
With one gesture he did take
The lives of all man woman child
And deafening silence followed in his wake
Like stub before a shiny blade
All man fell by his scythe
Once the fever got you in its grasp
There is but one more day left of your life
Black Death
Pestilence
Black Death
Pestilence
The Lord has all forsaken
All must cleanse themselves from sin
Then rid oneself from lust
And take the holy spirit in
To redeem your pity selves
You all must flog your filth away
With nightfall cometh the shadows
Gather all the children of the Lord and pray
The shadow heavy upon this land
And still the stale air sway
In great numbers all around
The fallen lie as they fell to rot away
Black Death
Pestilence
Black Death
Pestilence
Finally the purifying storm
First we die then be reborn
So flock the banner of The Return now fight and die
Many head serpent is here at our side
Wagnerian end the grand finale is here
Awash with red blood rebirth is near
Feel wind of Mayhem against your face
Bugle divine can be heard throughout space
If in the heat of battle you will have doubt
Just kill them all and let their God sort them out
The tales of this day will replace tomorrows weep
For when thou wind doth saw then storm thou shall reap
On the final day
The angel heart lies cold Under The Sign
And crimson still the frozen Blood On Ice
Drawn on walls in blood of goats the Octagon
The vagrant souls will chant the Requiem until the Twilight is long gone
Suck the leaves of otherness and lie down with the facces goddess
Eat from her rotten flesh there is no life before death
Now the sky is crimson with blood of angels
Kneel before the voice face the anger of God
Day Of wrath
Land of unforgiving winter
Cold, clad in white, under a dark grey sky
Silent, the wind, it whispers
Pale sun of gold, gazing from far up high
Endless forests, lakes of water dark and deep
Misty mountains, where giants sleep
High above all, the ravens
Spreading their wings to fly to the hall up high
Messengers of the all fathers
Odin behold all with his one eye
Eagle soaring, old crow cries
This land and heaven, forever tied
Cold the waves along the shoreline
White wolfs realm from here to mountains high afar
Land of ours since it rose out of deep cold sea
Shine on our path, yes brightest of all, Northstar
Forever-dark woods, cold winds sweep
Barren landscape, untamed and bleak
Silver, the moon high over pond of water calm and dark
Woe, mist, the breath of the dragon, sweeping down mountain side
All still, the day asleep, the sun rests in nest of the Gods
Afar high adventures await me, I hear my brothers calling
Spring is here and the ice breaks free
The endless sky and open sea
I will sail where the Raven will lead me
Fly on black wings, high and free
I shall return with the wind the day
From high adventures, swelling sail
Autumn red comes to Asa bay
Meet me by the well where the water, crystal clear, flows free
From deep within the great mountain towering to the sky
I will be awaiting you coming down treading the trails of elves
Bare feet, let your hair down like the mist across the pond
In dawn of time, before gods and man
When earth and sky was first divided
A star did fall into river deep
A star of gold into silvery water
While I sail, by this you shall remember me
Wear it, yours forever to keep
To bind us beyond end of time, to thee I give a ring of gold
Evening is falling, all still around me
The old crow is calling, but the landscape is at peace
Down the trail through this forest, through thicket we ride
The unseen is watching from behind each stone and pine
Slowly the golden disc of the sun is setting
Beyond the rim of Nordland at the end of long day
Slowly the ominous dark descend upon all
Engulfing all land and heaven and the shore of Asa bay
Here lie the bones of our fathers long gone
Deep in the soil of these woods
Among these great trunks legends were born
Here many great battles stood
Trotting the trail, my stallion cautious
Present the spirits of foreverdark woods
We rest by the fire, the shadows come to life by its light
Three brothers, sons of white wolf, observed by the eyes of the night
Night is long where the sunlight is pale
The fear is strong when you ride in the dawn
Down foreverdark woods trail
Heavy the turf, bone meal and blood
Raise high you pine towards sky
Firm in the soil, tree trunks of gods
Like dragon ship masts straight and high
Reaching the glade, ride on to Asa bay
Watched by the spirits of foreverdark woods
A veil of mist, a foreign coast
The calm before their battle cry
Steel drawn, the line of shields must hold
Through mist, the first arrow, it flies
Battle, hold firm the line in battle
Shoulder by shoulder, brothers at side
We may stand victorious or fall
This fine day, a fine day to die
We shall fight and may die by the sword
Cutting through flesh and bone, your sword
My brother, our father taught you well
But from behind the unseen blow
Mortally wounded, down you tell
Battle, hold firm the line in battle
Shoulder by shoulder, brothers at side
Silent by my side you did fall
This was a fine day a fine day to die
Brother, I'll keep your broken sword
By lightning conceived was I
The stars above became my eyes
Hvergelmir flows in my veins
My hair the mist across the never ending nameless lake
By womb of soil, the moist of dew
Born when sun was high, the day was new
And the raven soared high up in clear sky
The land will speak to you, when your heart is pure
And you were made by
Mother Earth, Father Thunder
This heart winged, I am eagles son
Through storm and spite, untouched, it is pounding on
This sword, forged in fire and ice
The runes that trail its blade can be seen but by my two eyes
As if written in the snow, the lies, shall melt away
By the wheel of sun to cross the sky this day
Shadows may lay heavy upon the earth
But the truth, cut deep in stone, will last
until the heavens comes tumbling down upon this world
Mother Earth, Father Thunder
Dark is the sea, raging waves
endless the sky above me
mighty is the wind that fills our sail
many of us will follow, our journey brave
The day when ice would break and sun was high
we sailed with wind of fate across the seas
we followed the stars bright in the night
The land was bleak and could not provide
sail across the sea with the wind and tide
brothers at my side, our blood the same
Odin up high, I call thy name
Through the fog they will come in the dawn
with the wind from the raging sea
beware of the men of the North
they will sail down the blooded shore
with the wind they will return to the seas
Down foreign shores, all land would sleep
silent at dawn, with fire and steel
by our swords, silver and gold
our journey glorious, tales will be told
The day when ice would break and sun was high
we sailed with wind of fate across the seas
we followed the stars bright in the night
The land was bleak and could not provide
sail across the sea with the wind and tide
brothers at my side, our blood the same
Oden up high, I call thy name
Through the fog they will come in the dawn
with the wind from the raging sea
beware of the men of the North
they will sail down the blooded shore
with the wind they will return to the seas
Into the granite, stave by stave
carved ploughwise, now read my tale
the raging ocean I have sailed
many a man I have maimed
Shields I have crushed with my sword
women have I pleased endless nights
on foreign coast my brother did fall
he now dines in hall up high
Erected the stone against a twilight sky
read Sea Wolf's tale
From the coasts of the west to sarkland
to the marshlands and the forests of the east
high adventures, great riches and wine
blood shed, great battles and feasts
My stone firm in mother eart through rain and time
read Sea Wolf's tale
Forward, ride the ocean's waves
be bold, glory to the brave
Deep the sea, above me eternal sky
freezing winds, cold to the limbs, the waves are high
sleepless nights, the bleak moonlight, the chill and damp
by morning light, a strip of land we see
Vinland, crossing the endless raging ocean
Vinland, follow the stars and the flight of the raven
Vinland, watch the horizon for the strip of the western land
Vinland, plough through the waves white wolfs at a raging sea
The wind, mighty, fills your sail
onward, to the land in your fathers' tale
Forward brothers, reward awaits the bold and brave
white sons of north, through hail and storms : we rode the waves
we beach the ship upon the coast of western land
and rest our tired limbs among the reed and sand
Vinland, crossing the endless raging ocean
Vinland, follow the stars and the flight of the raven
Vinland, watch the horizon for the strip of the western land
Vinland, plough through the waves white wolfs at a raging sea
This land is mine to the end of time
none it shall claim or conquer
the mountains high, the endless sky
the forests and the sea
Oh land rejoice, your son has sailed
beyond the seas, adventurous trail
now heading north, to Asa Bay
my place of birth, home of the brave
A man he may wither away
or die in battle with sword in hand
but the river will flow and the wind will blow
forever across my northern land
This land is mine to the end of time
none it shall claim or conquer
the mountains high, the endless sky
the forests and the sea
Oh fatherland, oh Northstar high
two hundred days and night have I
been away from you my hearts most dear
returning home, great wealth to share
Work those oars, the wind is still
no southern breeze our sail to fill
the dusk is here and our bay is far
Clear was the sky, now storm clouds are forming
the sun disc was high, the dusk came too soon
sighted, a forest of masts and sails
ride swift yee messenger, the word must get through
Carry the news to the villages westward
Asa Bay is under attack
light the signal fires along the shoreline
sound the bugle, upon us is the storm
Ride up the coast, sound the alarm
the enemy fleet soon to land
women and children to the hill : the enclosure
to the shore every brave able hand
Sons of ours afar in foreign land
their swords will be missed on this fateful day
brother of Eigil, who set sail for Vinland
with Torgeir the strong and Ashur the brave
Upon us the storm, the twilight was sudden
the clear sunny day, now bitterly cold
may the Gods be all with us, and fate by us stand
let the livestock all run and bury your gold
The messenger riding swift through the forest
crossing the wide open plains
carrying the news of the storm, the fleet fast approaching
to arms all, defend Asa Bay
Clear was the sky, now storm clouds are forming
the sun disc was high, the dusk came too soon
now restless the waves, unruly the sea
red are the sails, may the message get through
Now dark is the sky, the storm clouds assembled
the enemy fleet soon to land
in the dark grey haze glimmering sharp steel is drawn
the swelling sails nearer now, stand and fight every man
Ride through the forest, past mountains and creeks
upon us is fire and doom
carry me, run swift, my good able steed
the news of the storm must get through
Storm clouds are forming, darkening the sky
the wind gather speed up the mountains
along the horizon, lightning strikes
then the deafening rumble of thunder
Rain beat against my face
quench the thirst of mother earth
the wind in my hair
behold the flash of the silver hammer
Shadows across the land, all clad in grey
the waves raging wild along the shoreline
cutting through black clouds, a finger of fire
bonding the earth with the heavens
Mighty the wind of storm
forks of lightning lacerates dark sky
from within, the clouds, ablaze
by the flash of the silver hammer
As the night divides the day, 
the dark will come to everyone
fear will strike the hearts of all,
the hearts of all both old and young
the fool may be carefree, 
unknown to him the troubles upon his masters brow
but death us all will grasp with hand so cold to pull us down
And so the sun is low again, 
along horizon a crimson blaze
soon the dusk us all embrace, 
the shadows long as life itself
but in the light of moon and stars above be sure yee everyone
tomorrow new a day will dawn, 
none stay can the course of the wheel of sun
As sure as it is true once we all shall die, t
rue it is not all men lives
a king shall fall, 
a child be born, 
the Gods will take and Gods will give
before your time has come, 
do climb your mountainside on a morning fair
and smell the fragrance carried by the wind, 
let it blow freely through your hair
damned he who sits still and curse woe the dark but will do not a thing
to light the torch, 
to shed the light, 
for him the dark is all within
slowly across the sky the golden disc of life it tumbles on
the wheel of life and light, 
rebirth the seasons, 
behold the wheel of sun
Show me the face of uttermost madness
Reveal the mystery of time reversed
For in chaos lies mights forgotten
From which we all have emerged
Crawling from wombs
a vast reflection
A rupturing from deformed flesh
Yet a false revelation, a pointless effort
For the truth of all life is Death.
For your bodies form a giant shape
That cast shadows across all lands
Filled with the greatest of emptiness
Falling as it stands
A crucifix of flesh and bones
Lifeless, yet trembling in fear
For as sulphurflames are it's conscious
And the smothering is near
Emptiness spawn, pale stillborn breed
Blinded at birth and forever to be
His tusks pierced through eyelids and tongue
Not even Death can set you free
sense the smell of burning flesh
A titanic symbol of death's overture
Impaled on behorned pain
The limb crucifix, built on remains
Of the cursed breed of Cain
It cries and it suffers, burning within
Reaching towards the sky
Anguish shaped by bloodstained flesh
A shadow of Satan, longing to die
Born into a fatal illness
Ascension unto a graceless sphere
Yet the chain forged in sulphurfires
Emerges with them through labias lair
The stench, the curse, the sacrilege divine
The enduring of rupturing cold
Brought to life, crushed to dust
By an impenetrable presence of dark
Incarnation of plagues and of longdead pests
Fornication of all brought to life
Shadow majestic, spell infernal
At the core of mankind as a lifefeasting tumor
This curse if to haunt and to kill and to crush
For it's claws are the flesh of all life
It's eyes are the souls that burns at hell's heart
The ones who are blessed from it's strife
This plague is to die and again to be reborn
Through eternity and beyond
For it is life, the rabid death's curse
Cast by the firstborn, never to be gone
Of sharpened steel and of hanging ropes
Is the cure of this illness made
For all lives that walk are possessed by a curse
And in the end it all shall fade
Blessed from the filth
Touched by the mystery
Caressed by the dark
Left as a snake to crawl and to curse
May the seas they boil
And the napalm rain
Let mankind fade
For still it shall reign
Behold the burning of earth
And your feeble creation
Still cosmos shall tremble
Beneath his domination
Bow for me, inferior
I demand you in the name of the horns
For I am the one
To bring the demise of the bearer of thorns
You who's father
so pitiful upon the cross died
Behold it inverted
And burning under the nightsky
Inferior lord of heaven
Your might shall fade
Jesus has wept
On goathorns impaled
Unclean vermins, 
scum of the earth
Blow your heads for the dark ages birth
Black fire cast your flames high
Above the realms of light
Behorned father Satan
Show them all your might
Taste the blood
And the decayed flesh of his sons
Behold the desecration
Of the weaker and feeble ones
A cross burned black
Soaked in sacred blood
From all of us to all of you:
Go fuck your Jewish god
Inferior lord of heaven
Your might shall fade
Jesus has wept
On goathorns impaled
Black fire cast your flames high
Above the realms of light
Behorned father Satan
Show them all your might
A pallid shape is floating
A lurid shroud of fading life
What ones was a place so glimmering and bright
Has ignited itself and burnt out of light
I canonize thee, 
lord of the odious
For enlightening the path to perpetual might
For guiding me on this voyage
With nothing but scornful mirages in sight
Devour me, oh immense shadow
This locus is cursed, shroud me forever
Damnation be my lodestar
For humanity carves my veins
I've been nailed to a cross of anguish
Crucified above to behold
The blind, the loathsome's strife in vain
The holiness of those who should suffer my pain
Lunar strains of morbid grace
Reflections of nocturnal mysteries
Eternally hidden for their eyes
As what awaits behind
Branded by the unpure light
But still, You like I
Reaches for the dark
And even further
As symbols of life we are fading
To were this twilight reaches night
A pallid shape is strangled
As my soul and his darkness unite
It wont shine through
Believe it, you're never to see
That my flesh is carved with spells
Of mankinds destiny
Blessed with contempt
For what has edged my strife
And through sacrilegious veils
I dethrone life
Spawn of the darkest evil divine
A creation of the holy womb
Step aside for lord Satan
His fist so deep within
A servant am I and in flesh am I captured
Holy flesh and holy sin
Oh, the strength it does not take
To deny life's lying pleasure
Their wars stills my hunger
The tears in their eyes still my thirst
Yet their life's feeds my despite
eternally to be cursed
As it opens for me
In darkest desolation I behold
My blood runs cold through my veins
Running in vain
Lands fall behind my eyes
And humanity is bleeding
And in my hand I hold the key
To all living holy glory
and all that is evil
The womb of life is rotten black
The seed of light dried dead
The fist of Satan deep within
Behold the cunt of life in sin
Behold the purest evil
The creation of a higher force
Lurking within all of man
Stronger than every life and lie
Beyond gods pestilent grace
Obscured by light his spawner dwells
Hidden but soon to be found
Beyond shrouds of fading life
All fires leave reeking ashes
Not only glow that shines
And the dawns you've blessed shall be cursed
A thousand times
Clean the mirrors from the dust of God
And nothing shall be there
For you are to weak to turn the key
Chained to life by fear
Oh, as solitude awakes
Razorsharp it shines
Reflections in your gazing eyes
For the first time burnt by sun
Each dawn rising in plaugeous glory
And touches the withering ground
Shall feed your agony fires
For your truth has now been found
Feel the power
Bow down like the servant you are
For great evil flows through your shells
A fall from grace
Yet a rising in glorious ashes
The gate lies crushed
And the key to life has melted
A path will open
And wrath will enter
I rejoice in silence
Suffering is the key to the world of the beast
Each dawn rising in plaugeous glory
And touches the withering ground
Shall feed your agony fires
For your truth has now been found
Feel the coming of a storm
Of wrath burning red as blood
Thundering forth
With poison in veins and death in the eyes
Under banners as mirrors reflecting
The darkness above and below
And the eye
The eye that is him
Bonecrush, bloodlust
Behold the remains of Jehovah in the dust
Suffocate, Desecrate
For Satan's return
Warlust fill my veins
As bullets in the heart of humanity
Darkness drown me
As carnal shreds of light soaked in blood
Cursed to wander
And to eternally despise
Forever to stride
For evil never dies
The beauty of destruction
The passion of death
Immortalized
In your ashes
Bonecrush, bloodlust
Behold the remains of Jehovah in the dust
Suffocate, Desecrate
For Satan's return
Created by them
Yet reborn through Him
Blessed from life and lie
For the cunts that are licked
By your gentle tongues
Are raped and cursed to die
So far beyond
Your rottening grace
Yet trapped in smelling chains
For the bodies you caress
I have cursed
And put cancer in their veins
The blazes in the night called stars
Are reflections of your kind
Pallid and fading lives
Spawned and guarded by darkness behind
For what dwells behind those flames
Is hidden for your eyes
And just one single glance
Would transform your smiles into cries
There is a war in my heart
While yours is thorned by my nails
For you are nothing but dead
Beneath those carnal veils
Rejoice as emptiness grow thicker
Feel it's grasp around your neck
The hour has come to release
And to welcome the razorsharp fate
Feel the jaws of the snake
Slaves under cosmic contempt
Mortem sibi consciscere
Your key to achievement
To reach the point in this desolation
When it all unveils
The revelation of a mysterious light
Was yet another dismal mirage
And I beheld another gate open
To a wound where dead flesh crawls
A loathsome spawn of what is feigned
By feeble minds, 
a thin veil that shines
Strong and Luminious
yet suffering from life's malady
Immense, yet chained
burning for Him
Celestial
but trapped inside life's malediction
Yet slowly fading away
Beyond carnal perdition
Succumb, bearers of his plague
For his evil eats from within
Behold the falseness in the greatest of riddles solved
Life is a cold and empty lie
Born into a twilight
A mighty yearning to ignite
A voyage across black waters
Still aiming for his paradise
Falling into slumber
A departure swept in mist
Embraced by a higher force
Of supreme evil glory
Strong and Luminious
Yet suffering from life's malady
Immense, yet chained
burning for him
A watcher
Of your pallid and fading grace
For I can see a dawn
Swept in darkest haze
Fire
Burns in my eyes
Gaze into the barrel
And taste the wonders of Christ
My Fists Are Him
My fists are Him
The raging divinitys
As they reach
And as they strangle
My fists are Him
Of flesh and blood
Carnal infernal
In the soar throat of God
Cold seed - Demon breed
Lifeless might eternally
My fists are Him
The deeds of sin
He is the lightning that blindly strike
Wherever man may walk
Feasting on life's unsolved mystery
Towards which all living walk chained
And my fists are the vultures
Their claws and their eyes
My fists are Him
Buried in the cunt of time
My hair is the snake crawling among you
In deceitful venomous delight
My heart is the hammer
Which shape is beyond your sight
My fists crush the bones
That blind your eyes from shame
For the ground of earth eroding
Rests on the Devil's flames
Death dance
Black trance
The grip around your throat enhance
My fists are Him
As life turns dim...
Ageless, eternal in grace
Behold the snake of temptation!
Eyes gleaming with wisdom
Tounges telling of truths inversed
I have swallowed the hanged mans semen
With necrophageous delight
And let the Devil enter
With all his might
And in unbearable shame, 
enlighted by your fathomless dark
I kneel unto thee, father, i am opened
Let your daggers pierce through and their poisonous grace be unleashed
through these hungering veins
The impurest of blood, the greatest of pains
The Devils blood
The curse of salvation
The odious essence
of His holy revelation
It floats from the garden of eden
In malevolent grace
The Devil's blood
Through the pentagram's maze
To open the gates to where deformations form
To unearthly mysteries and fire
From stigmatized wounds now the river of gnosis runs free
In the glorious light of the five point star
Darkness, starlight in eyes
The path reveals so clear now
I drink my own blood yet the taste is not mine
I behold my reflection yet noone stares back
Driven by a lifeless hunger
Must have it stilled
Drop by drop, curse by curse
Until all three cups are filled
This soul prayeth not for victory, but for loss
This body kneeleth not in vain, but in blood
These eyes seeth not nil, but truth
These words are spoken not by me, but through
The Devils blood
The curse of salvation
The odious essence
of His holy revelation
From the tounges of the serpent
Into chalices three
The Devil's blood
Run through me!
Visions of hornshaped shadows
A burning firmanent black
Trembling in the glory of a star
Delightfully glowing with evil
Ten signs to spawn
A thousand of children
And to be given strength
Each time a heart it beats
For they gave birth to the sun and the moon
To cast shadows upon life
And to burn the slaves that in madness gaze
With scorn from serpent eyes
Just as cancerous cocaine
Deep in the veins of christ
The malignant curse divine
Floats within you all
You all!
May the holy light of Satans might
Burn my eyes!
This filth is not worth the glance...
Shining steel with Devil's seal
Cut my flesh!
Let them lick the blood
In the ashes of my fallen temple
And just as cancerous cocaine
Deep in the veins of christ
The malignant curse divine
Floats within you all
And the bonds are burning
Along with His eyes
Forever to brand the heart of god
Forever... 
spearing cosmos core!
For it was that light
That branded the Devil's mark
Into my flesh
My soul and my heart
Never to close these eyes
Never to still this thirst
High on the cross of sophia
Through black salvation I hang cursed
And all that is holy, holy shall be...
Let the light bless and
let these words proclaim the blessing.
Let the seal be broken and let the light prevail;
Let the earth be scorched and let the light prevail;
Let the wrath cleanse the world from opposition...
...and let heaven spew brimstone on sin!
And all that is holy, holy shall be...
Let alive the word's proclamation,
Let the laws of The Books be the laws of the earth;
Let humanity be sin and let denial be bliss;
Let the wars cleanse the world and
let their fear show their path.
Let the Light reign over Man and beast,
let the Lord strike the sinners with plague,
let the Lord our God reign for eternity;
and all that is Holy, Holy shall be...
For the carnal and earthly mouths of Christ
He has made blind and as vices they are
Let their words and acts be spears and be chains
Tormenting the weeping face of their god
From the valley of Sodom to the hill of armageddon
Behold the holocaustclouds and heed the trumpet's roar
A Charge more forceful than ever witnessed
May the Angels of Heaven shed the blood of Man
Behold, the new and true Gospel,
the words come from the Lord himself,
Redemtion through death!
Salvation through fire!
And all that is holy, holy shall be...
Let the light bless and
let these words proclaim the blessing.
Let the seal be broken and let the light prevail;
Let the earth be scorched and let the light prevail;
Let the wrath cleanse the world from opposition...
and let heaven spew brimstone on sin!
Let the prophets of double voices free
And in Gehinnoms splendour eternally
Let them BURN for their true majesty
And all that is Holy, Holy shall be!!!
Blinded soul, vomit faith
fingers reaching deep
Senses made dogmas
And the Phoenix rises...
None is denial
I am not one of mine
His words unlocked
Backwards, reforming what won't reflect
Assembling puzzles of flesh
Perfect... yet unknown!
Sigils encarved, the burning stench reveals frustration
None could deny Him!
Carrying the voids of those eyes
None is denial
I am not one of I
My words unlocked
It reveals through the fall
Staring at the abyss, getting further
Through mirrors...
Flesh and mind complete, in need for substance!
You are denied
You are not one of He
Your words are locked.
He lives through me
All of what I am
The needle of hamartia
Injected in the flesh of man
With the soul of a carrion
Sleeping, yet awake
For underneath this skin
Crawls eden's cursed snake
You may have felt it's cold
Carressing down your spine
Gently yet with strength
And with a morbid touch
For its real shape is a razor
Smeared with the Devil's seed
And infected with it's plauge
Are the scars from which I bleed
I am the earth
Chained to horns
Its ground is my flesh
Pierced by Holy thorns
I am the earth
Burning deep within
It's water is my blood
Blackened by my sins
Swallowed by His mystery
Lots within it's maze
The bridges behind they burn
from the pyres of Hell's grace
One after another
The stars fade into black
He has called my name
There is no way back...
Pierced by His will
Trapped within His lair
My flesh shall be the sign
Of that fires are to fear
For those who walk upon me
Shall be punished for their turns
I am the earth
And within me the Devil burns!
I am the earth
In the shadow of the Lord
A crucifix of flesh
Yet sinfully adored
I am the earth
As your life with me does blend
I am His truth
The world without end...
The world without end.
All ysop burnt, all fruits are poisoned
Zaddik failed and Zebaoth lost,
The lambs are banished, the temple is soiled
March on white ruin, infernal host
So come forth, Lord of the triple number
Rise, oh trinity of DEATH, DEATH and DEATH
Burn this vermin world in its most deep slumber
And to all of Sheob, give the sulphur breath
Blacken all their ghastly colours
And freeze to scorn their charity warmth
Smear our sin to their most pure innocense
And nail them all to the cross!!!
For they live to die, we die to live
Our beginning is their end!
While they fall with twelve, we rise with seven
So wake the astral serpent by Thy pale hand!!!
All ysop burnt, all fruits are poisened
Adonai failed and Elohim lost
The lambs are slaughtered, 
our temple shines golden
Crawl on your ruin, seraphic host ...
And my tongue speaks ancient names
Forbidden psalms above the flames
My heart pumps but void into my veins
My puls runs slow, too slow for chains
For chains that tie me down to earth
For chains that keep up this organic curse
The demons astir within the ruined temples of our flesh
No less real than those whose voices echoes through the starless abyss
No less cruel their nature, 
no less harmful their intent
Of sinful seed, of soiled womb, 
circling the five wings throughout eternities
And in a tomb beneath the pyramid of faith, 
as a crown lain at their feet
Behold the pillaged and impure remains of a god who failed
Guarded by the giant pillars to be moved by the Devil alone
For they are the stones of the throne of Christ 
which He swallowed and exhaled unto earth as his own!
Thine gills art dried!
Iesous Christos Theou Uios Soter
Where there was heart shall be vertebra
For your children have been led astray!
Quench thine thirst with my urine
Warm as love it shall rinse through the salt in your lungs
For the thirst of the desert strangles all senses
Tempted art thou and no one can resist Him...
None!
For what is the worth of a godless prophet whose tongue since long has dried, 
in completeness bereft from grace?
Through millenniums tormented by the eternal eye and it's piercing vigilance
Doomed to fail, for what hope can you ignite in their forsaken hearts?
When in deluge thou art fallen, 
your scriptures are altered and your doctrine rewritten in blood?
What unity in tribes long scattered?
What glory and hope in a cross that is shattered?
The mourning wails of defeat echoes throughout centuries!
The horns of the Baphomet in the wounds of Jesus thrice
An allegiance of flesh and steel, unto which titan altar we all kneel
Hark! The reversed words from the pulpits of abomination!
See him now possessed and reborn, the fallen messiah alight
At the burning crest of the serpent's spiral smiling in confusion
Fear all ye faithful for no longer on his forehead a crown of thorns
In the shadow of the bloodstained cross Christ has risen with horns!
Iniquity's mystery revealed!
Where there was thorns shall be the horns of a goat
For neither in life or in death are they absent!
The greatest of creations laid to waste!
Malformed and depraved limbless nothingness son of a whore
Two nails in your hands for both father and son
And in the dirt of your feet piercing the holy spirit
From the vaults below the deserttemple
To the throne among the stars
In the hearts of us, your children, oh divine luminary
Like sunbeams penetrating the foundations of the earth
Thine grace ignites the seeds of creation
And in our veins is stillness, as your shadows come to life
For they are like whispers speaking of
death in heaven
Behold the black cloud of corpselike birds
Their wings are on fire
And their song has turned backwards
A morbid cacaphony singing of...
A new dawn!
Burn my flesh, thou light of lights
Most eminent perfection, most magnificent of sights
Mark me with thee, stainless Ar
Most real, so clear and bright they shine both eye and star
Descend upon the dead, black sky
By a grace of just one glance they all shall die
Pour the bitter wine of salvation into our blood
And let our scars form rivers flooding the kingdom of their god
Let the immense gates of heaven open
Let the dawn of justice come
When a thousand pale and silenced faces
Turn towards the sky
To behold in fear and wonder how the firmanent turns dark
By the sound of a lonely trumpet calling
And countless birdlike carrions falls reeking from above
Embedded in a red glow telling of...
A burning dawn!
For this sunrise shall not wake you by the foul light of Christ
But by Satan's fire burning in your eyes
And the thundering voice of a lion over the plains of man
Shall proclaim the horned phoenix final rise
For it is not rain that falls tonight from the black, ominious sky
But sulphur tears from the last flock of birds
And the wind carries the smell of death, from the agony in their hearts
As the fly in nameless fear towards...
I ascend.
As thy light descends
Darkening the I to reveal the Self.
The rays of Gnosis are burning yet liberating.
In a blissful imposition of the primal paradox.
Ultimate and all-embracing.
For as above so below.
As I am lying beyond where mental winds blow.
Release me now, oh saviour of Anti-Cosmos.
Ignite in me the fire of the storming triple 6.
Now oh god of wrath,
Unchained in you to burn,
Rape and destruct!
Astaroth open my eye!
And let the beast regain his sight.
A gift from Azerate.
A path way back to thy Thoughtless Light!
Legions of the Black Light!
Chosen sons of snakes.
A burning wrath reveals the Black Sun.
Black Sun Ascends. Forevermore.
Granted to the elected is the key to Chaos core.
Judge me now oh shining one, by blood and fire.
To wield thy sword, oh Lord and Master.
The eleventh and the first.
Whose wordless word echoes Chaos!
Oh firebringer of the Nightside.
Thy light illuminates our Temple,
As we march towards the Other Side
Legions of the Black Light.
Chosen sons of snakes.
A burning wrath reveals the Black Sun.
Legions of the Black Light.
Chosen sons of snakes.
A burning wrath now unveils the Black Sun.
The winds of darkness blow again...
Ridden by the mares of night.
They beckon me in dreams and visions.
From far beyond creations light they sing to me...
Wrathful beast of Satan's fire.
They urge me further on my path.
Now soaked in froth and dark desire,
At the threshold of the inverted womb I stand.
Surrounded by darkness
Amidst its blackened clearness
There is naught to veil my sight.
I can behold as they ascend,
The malformed horrors of the night,
And feel the crosses turn...
Each sense grow dim as if one with the dead,
And as I fall on my knees to the ground I am fed
With the fumes of shallow graves
Into the starless night, I follow the stench.
Urged on by a thirst that can not be quenched.
Into the starless night, I must go.
The urge is so strong, it's all that I know...
Satan's hunger. Satan's hunger.
The luring lament of a witch,
The psalms of angels fallen.
The chanting of the undead.
They echo in the wind...
Sanity and senses with darkness now aligned,
Like tentacles and angelwings
In foulest love entwined.
And the graves begin to open...
The brightest light
Will always cast the darkest shadows.
Shadows in which truth lies concealed.
For deep in the tunnels
Beyond the dream of this world
The mysteries truly reveal...
Into the starless night, I follow the stench.
Urged on by a thirst that can not be quenched.
Into the starless night, I follow the call.
Urged on by a lust, that eliminates all.
Satan's hunger. 
Satan's hunger!
Ancient night sky,
You cannot hide your fears from me,
When even the bodies roaming thee
Spells out your giant fall.
Man and beast,
Thinkest thou not that I see
The panic in your eyes?
As the world grows dark,
And the mysteries thicken around thee.
Secrets revealed in the shrines of the dead,
That speak in tongues of a gate.
A door to the abyss,
Between the triads base.
A crack in the circle,
A hole in the world...
Storm of the Antichrist.
Harbinger of eternal night.
The serpent rises from the sea.
The star of madness gleaming.
Storm of the Antichrist.
The Sword of Satan undisguised.
Wielded now against the face of the earth
To unleash it's fiery within.
Yes, arise now, Beast with seven heads!
Lucifer descend in clouds of red.
A thousand serpents at His feet.
Radiating light that eat the stars
And open up the emanations of the Darkside.
Christ hides his face in shame now
As the soul of men collapse.
Mothers weep as their daughters kiss
The limbs of abominations.
Behold! The Beast untamed,
The Lord unchained,
Through eternities in the dark waters remained
The slumbering essence of wisdom most foul,
Awoken now through prophecy.
And these jaws hold no mercy as they rise wide agape
To devour your sons in their impotent pride.
To pierce through the flesh into their motionless hearts
Which never again shall find peace.
For yours is the kingdom, oh Serpent of old!
Concealed in primordial watery cold.
Towering now over oceans of blood.
The Dragon entwined in the entrails of god.
Storm of the Antichrist.
The poles collapse, the heavens die.
A world in spasms, a god in tears.
The levee of Jehova breaks,
Unleash the burning flood of Satan.
Storm of the Antichrist.
Legions of Azazel rise!
Signs of evil in the sky
Foretell the giant coming...
Bloodlines tainted through fornication.
Fathers desire their own spawn.
Babylon rides the Beast of seven heads
Across the world in doom.
Phallus of Death once more erect.
Semen stains the grass of gethsemane.
The potency of serpent seed
Injected now in the womb of god...
Radiant Lucifer, Oh Phosphorous divine,
Who outshine all the stars
In the heavens and beyond.
Thou who art fallen,
And risen in the deeps,
In the gleaming halls of darkness
And forbidden mysteries.
By your vigour
And by your emerald phantasm,
Illuminated and in awe I stand
To curse all of the world.
Reborn beneath the Black Sun,
On my knees for none but thee,
Whose flames ignites the heavens,
And scorch them thoroughly.
Rising from the deeps of Urkaos.
Hovering in doom.
Black sun of dissolving fire,
By whose wrath the self of god shall die.
Bursting from its roaring surface.
Shining from the Serpent's eye.
The Boundless Light that burns the sun.
The fire of the Fallen One.
God of Death primordial.
Flame of the unknown.
Mould my heart into a vessel,
And possess it as your own!
Make my torch into a furnace.
So that I can see the secrets clear.
Holy, radiant, silent.
A light so strong it bears the wrath of a god.
Rise! Oh Promethean Serpent of the underworld.
Ascend unto the highest,
Above the very thrones.
Breath unto the embers
That dwell within my heart.
For within them lies the key
To it's perditionate reincarnation.
Awakened from it's restless slumber.
My Daimon, unbound to reign.
As I walk beyond the grace of god
Into the roaring deeps arcane.
My eyes they burn as I behold
The wings of Lucifer unfold.
Transcending now into formation
To burn the sun and all creation.
Block not my path!
You futile walls of of flesh and blood.
For I have seen your structure clear
And I know where to stab.
Right in the heart.
There shall I place my dagger
Naught shall veil my sight
But the thickness of the mysteries.
So block not my path
Your spells can't fetter me.
Beneath the laws of man
I bend not!
For it is holy,
The sword I bury in thee.
It is the Lord himself
Who commands me.
Sworn to the Dark.
To the Death and far beyond.
The all-defying pendulum of radiant conviction,
So determined in it's pace,
Pounding now through flesh and bone
Like a hammer through a child.
Sworn to the Dark.
To the Death and far beyond.
Bound by an oath sealed beyond time.
Sworn to the Temple of the Damned.
Where infant entrails still hang high
Upon the twisted cross.
Through raging fire,
Through Death and hail.
Clinging to the Dragons tail.
And as the world behind me burns
I ride its wings on paths of No Return
Lifeless and sour from death and from doom.
In the soil of my tomb not one flower shall bloom.
Nothing but Death in this earth shall abide,
In this my pathway to the other side.
And thus I close my eyes...
On through the tunnels, darkness ablaze.
Passing through Naamah, queen of the gateways.
The jaws of her darkness they feast on my eyes
As the last of the earthly lights flickers and dies.
Dark are the dreams on the stone bed.
For no sunlight shall reach to the land of the dead.
As I journey through tunnels and blackened chasm.
In the realms of Death unbound.
Underneath the cenotaph.
Revelations revealed through crepuscular trance.
Shadows of demons in catacombs dance.
Luminous signs of impossible shape.
Traveling deep, no return, no escape.
Wonderous, prosperous marvels most dark.
I fall to my knees
And behold as I hark
The tongues of the ancients,
Damned and aflame,
Chanting in madness...
Closer and closer,
The flames reaching higher.
Trial by fire! Trial by fire!
Coalescence of high and low.
Hand in hand with the damned I go.
A dance in shadows...
The burning fears of the world beyond,
At the end of these snakelike trails,
Are the same as those which forged this heart
And so my birth through death prevails.
Dark are my dreams on the stone bed.
For no sunlight shall reach to the land of the dead.
In flames I shall at last become.
With fire I am one.
Underneath the cenotaph.
Wings of Satan, orb my heart!
It burns with love for you.
And it is ready now, to receive thee.
Claws of darkness, tear my soul!
For I have chosen the night
And branded its seal into my flesh.
Lead me to the catacombs
Where light of neither sun nor moon
Disturbs the dark in vaults,
Possessed by molten evil manifest.
There I shall kiss the goat and piss on god.
Sundering the molecules that bind
This world together with me.
An abortion of the cosmic bride,
Shunned like death and cast aside.
Cross starless skies now let us ride...
A spear of fire staked the skies.
The graves sprung open.
The chains that sealed the hungry deeps
Had now been broken.
Open now, abode of Satan's powers!
Where the shells of evil burn
The very eyes of god,
And the womb of the world.
It is from this wellspring of blazing death
That light is flowing, forceful...
Into the gleaming vessel of my Self.
And thus I am filled
With the waters of Styx.
Kingus blood.
The Bane of god.
Yes I become the serpents chalice
And the power it bestows.
A wisdom that exceeds Death.
Virtues that all laws oppose.
Firmly upheld amidst the horns aflame.
Man and God, in fire one and same.
Black flames from the deeps aspire,
As in the chambers of my hearts desire,
I limn thy brilliant potency in fire.
Darkness and Death!
What are your secret enchantments?
Where lies the beauty of your oppression?
For I am entranced...
What innocence could have such splendour?
No naked beauty nor a warm smile.
But the Power to leave stars and worlds
In lifeless silence...
Sublime is the hand of no pity.
That wields a merciless Death.
To judge not by deeds
But by the approval of a god!
Victorious heart of deceit.
Shaped in red beauty yet carved in black stone.
Killing not to win, but to ensure a loss.
Mendaciously poundering through Death...
Darkness and Death!
Your blessed art lives through me.
Through entranced submission.
By the love of God!
With the strength of the mountains,
Come forth from the North
With the hunger of oceans,
Come forth from the West
As fire and flame,
Come forth from the South
As thunder and storm,
Come forth from the East
In the darkness,
In the nothingness of absent light,
Where no life force is permitted to exist.
From far beyond the borders,
Where god not dares,
The Serpent gloats in hunger.
No star will shine tonight.
No star, no matter how bright.
Across the firmament goes its flight.
A great darkness devouring the light.
God of Death. 
Manifest.
God of Doom. 
Move and appear!
Spread thine countless tentacles
Across the universe.
Let them spasm throughout
The labyrinth of trembling stars.
Strangle their flickering flames,
Eat them whole.
Wander ancient Dragon,
Across the cursed heavens.
Yes, behold now as it opens
To swallow the world
And to melt the very essence of creation.
The burning mouth of Samaël,
Through which all shall be reborn.
Wide agape now in this final hour.
And from its reeking darkness
A new kingdom shall ascend,
Erected on the pillars
Of the ever-burning underworld.
Can't you see the twisted branches
Of the tree of Death?
Rising now in putrid doom
At the center of the world!
Let us welcome the Bringer of the End
With open arms.
Let us adorn the gates to nothingness
With blood.
Let us lay its enemies
Like palm leaves upon the path
On which the Lord is coming in glory.
The upheaval of the ages,
That naught shall shun.
Time and space devoured as one.
From your abode in the dark,
Come forth; Thou who eats the stars!
God of Death. 
Manifest.
God of Doom. 
Move and appear!
God of Death. 
Manifest.
Strike once more.
The pact is sealed, crystallised
Dark are the paths without return
Ash and blood colour my world
Ever downward winding steps spiraling to the utmost depths
Where the sun is but a memory of a murdered dream
As if emerged from the Abyss
Evoked by his own tongue
Antichrist, Devil's child
Possessed by the night
Through will unfettered in darkness
Death was granted life
The blind man was given sight
And the fivefold star to shine forevermore
As a flame within the heart
Restlessly beckoning through
The guilt and vanity of a world deaf to it's call
To dare what's lit sole by the friar's lantern
Through labyrinths so desolate and dark
to travel far in solitude and silence
across thornclad deserts vast
To witness the erection of a temple
At the place where order dies and chaos unfold
It's tower shall lean out over the precipice
Oh the wonder's those that mount it shall behold
For there the waves of Absu smash the rocks of definition
And feast upon them with erosive force
Yes there the ancient giants of primordial waters
Are hunting in the twilight near the shores
And I am their son, my ribcage the shrine, my flesh the prison
For my blood is their blood, my will is theirs
Mine is the gift that shall conquer all fears
See my glowing eyes reflect a heart that burns
That in turn reflects the chasm for which it yearns
He shall return to the Abyss
Heeding his masters call
Antichrist, Devil's child
At one with the night
Wordless without form in deepest depths,
Yet most besung, most present and most high
Thou wellspring from which horror's holy flow
Through gates wide open
Thou who placed these words of praise upon my lips
The infant's cry and the rapist's sigh of joy
The world has gone blurred but the road gets
Ever clearer in search of thy burning kingdom
By the blessing of shunned Gods
the cord of life was deformed, twisted into a noose
to strangle the miscarriage of the I
upon which he shall feast that was spawned
by the semen of horror's fertile
as his many limbs extend across the Abyss
thirteen horns and a million tusks
in a thousand jaws that breathe
only to chew the chains that tie him to Assiah
and titan is their strength
yours is the call I follow
astride the wings of Death
to the crossroads
Malfeitor, the master and servant in unity
at one with the Abyss when in your possession I am
against the blindness of men
thine eyes have been granted immunity
so that my sight be clear when wielding the Sword of the Damned
For I am begotten of the virgin whore
as truth and torment, priest and warrior
now behold as I pervert and destroy their law
as the image of my philius moists the labia of Shekinah
for dark are the desires that dwell within my heart
and the Devil is in my kiss
Yes he is
Malfeitor!
in your possession I am
twilight god of transformation
at the crossroads we meet again
I'll pace the path of madness with your banner held high
to the death's head true
yes, I am of my father the Devil and the lusts of my father I will do
There is a place beyond the dreamworlds,
Past the womb of night,
Lying in wait beyond the barriers of light,
Shunned by the living, cursed by the dead
Here's no peace, here's no peace
None within, none without
Skinned bare by daggers that never doubt
Timeless in wisdom, unbound in might,
Holy Evil!
By trembling hands concealed,
Yet by fearless ones revealed
There the blood of Abel impregnates the soil,
In which hungry darkness dwells and serpents coil,
So that plants may rise to bear the strangest fruit,
For all of ye that hunger
Higher! Higher! 
Come on you sons of fire!
Daughters of the black moon,
Practitioners of art most dire
Dance! Dance! 
In twisting, white-eyed trance,
Let us praise the flowering darkness
Brush forth across the land of Nod ye wicked ones,
Ye who wear the mark and hold the keys,
Come now, let us worship,
At the womb of blasphemies
Rivers of blood! 
Rivers of blood!
For the black earth's quenchless thirst,
The offering must never cease,
Until the last man has been slain
Upon the altar of Mefisto
Higher! Higher!
Let's set the night on fire!
Black moon bear witness to our rite,
Beneath the devil's pyre
Unchain, Set free, the flames of the Adversary!
Scorch the earth and devour all,
That sifted from the ashes be
Hail! Hail! 
Thou who makes the cosmos wail!
In anguish as we fuck the world,
And sodomize the god that failed
By thy blade let all god's men be slain!
Harvest now the fruits of death and set the night aflame!
Again!
Fire!
Gather! Gather! 
Raise the flames for so long scattered!
For aeons cursed, yet proud we stood,
Our liberation all that mattered
It's time! It is time! 
The bells of Armageddon chime!
Rejoice ye now, oh hungry ones,
Harvest time has come...
Come redeeming wings of final judgement
the greatest war to bring the deepest peace
tread forth in shapeless silence
through the gateway prepared for thee
oh bringer of firbidden fire
in the midst of the underworld borth
let us hold high the Chalice of Satan
and drink deep, to the world's end
Let our praise reach out to all corners of the earth
hail Levyathan!
and put fear in the hearts of all those by its mud given birth
hail Lucifer!
tonight the heavens shall burn by the love of our Lord
hail Beelzebuth!
great god of the lawless no longer in shadows adored
hail Belial!
May these words of your sons and daughters
churn thee up from chaos waters
as they reach into the outer world to summon forth the final tide
when bottomless Absu has drunk itself dry
and turns from womb to tomb
a gaping hole into which all shall fall
day of wrath unto night without end
equilibrium of Total Death
Majesties of lawless darkness
in our hearts thy thrones prepared
storm and water, earth and flame
in spirit joined, released and untamed
Deep of the west, dragon, ye crocked one
hail Leviathan!
flame of the south, lightbringer, morning sun
hail Lucifer!
storm of the east, wordless and desolate lord
hail Beelzebuth!
mount of the north, wrath of the underworld
hail Belial!
How the moon leer's at thy ignorance
Ye who laughest in the face of death
Know ye not its ever-gaping jaws?
They always hunger
Oh they wake up from their slumber now
Heeding the call of the wild
From the shadows they come forth
Abominations of the north!
Murderers, spawn of might impregnated by many a blackened will
The stalking horror
For long time gone
Hungry now for the kill
Holy guardians of the secrets nocturne
For which many a man have burned
And so the night winds cry out their dreaded warning wail
The wolves have returned
Beware!
The wolves curse
Beware!
The dark
Fear!
The lupus lunae
At night, beware!
Dwellers of the threshold
Children of the night
Predators and punishers, fearless yet feared
The stench of putrefaction and of long dead blood follow their steps
Ever so near
Beware!
The wolves curse
Beware!
The dark
Fear!
The lupus lunae
Fear!
The return
Approach them not with doubt in heart
Disturb them not in vain
Only the cursed ones
The wild at heart may enter their domain
A lawless realm where chaos breeds and howls most foul asound
So stay away, ye whores of God
This is enemy ground
Beware!
The wolves curse
Beware!
The dark
Fear!
The lupus luna
Beware!
Kerberos are we
The three-pronged spear
Shape-shifters, always hungry
Far beyond the grace of God lies the lair
Where shadows fall
Beware!
At first a noisome pack
I am the rancid mark that devours making man
Once upon a whimpering babe
I am the murderer's hand that wields the blade of regicide
Oh Babylon thou harlot
Succubus of a thousand suitors
I am the foetid stench of thy burning hag's embrace
A perverse incubation
I am the olive branch corrupt with venomous asps
Totalt funeral
Desolate one
Total funeral
Total death
Around their neck the noose draws tight
A knot of thorns felling holy men and kings
I am the vile countenance of the gibbet's grasp
Of what was wrought and where was spent the seed
I am the black spider, the splinter within our minds
Fill your mouth with the foul earth
Suffocate on the souls
I am the messiah of famine and lies
Grim brilliance in frost
Desolation made flesh
I am the son of darkness and death
Total funeral
Desolate one
Total funeral
Total death!
Mighty path-opener
Striking fast as the sharpest of spears
Bringer of the black light
I bask in your halo of glory and might
Treader of the Path of thorns, cursed yet truly blessed
Through exile, coronation and conquest
To the throne of the Ravens of Death
Mighty master Qayin, guide my hand
For my deeds are thine
Firstborn of the Black Light
Lord of the Shadows of Death
And father of the Bloodline
And as I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death
I shall fear no evil, for Baaltzelmoth is with me
His scythe smites all my enemies
And his 7 keys open the gates leading beyond this prison so foul
Death bringer
Death dealer
Whose might even the pale raped moon reflects
Thorn-crowned master, scythe wielder
Bearer of the serpent's mark
By your left hand green was stained red to bring forth the Black
For to kill one is to murder all
The mark on your brow is the sign I follow and bear
Show me the secrets of seed, root and fruit
To harvest from the tree of knowledge
Before the final reaping lead by Death's sinistral hand
From below the first grave mound
At the crossroad of life and death
The gates within were opened without
The great black cross stands solemn upon the skull and the crossed bones
And the mysteries whispered by the dwellers within the
With the signing of the first dead
In Death
Through blood and incense burning in snake shapes
You opened wide the gates
And I looked and beheld a black horse and its masters name was Qayin
And Hell followed with him
Though manmade, of terrestrial birth
I've always walked upon this earth
A stranger searching the unknown
For that distant place that is my home
Oft I watched without affright
The stern magnificence of night
By moonless skies and beasts denied
Bewitched am I, and wanting
A yearning beyond form
A call without sound
Enter ye pale lord of silence
With passion I have come to loathe
This globous sty of vain misgrowth
Where man amass in nauseous mound
Flesh 'pon death 'pon flesh abound
So come!
Reap!
Kiss of Death!
Lips envenomed
Devil's breath
Beneath mistletoe sharpened we shall meet
A unit to extinguish the failure of the primordial touch
The kiss of death
My love shall last 'til death do me part
For thee, ye children of my heart
Ye glass of swiftly running sand
Ye harvester, ye cold white hand
The yearning has been with me always
To tread inside your timeless hallways
To know thy scent and taste thy flavour
To sense thy grasp, oh reaping saviour
Shapes without form
Voices without sound
Enter ye pale lord of sorrow
Kiss of death
Lips envenomed
Devil's breath
Beneath the waning crescent, we shall meet
Eager and fearless shall I receive the final touch
The kiss of death!
Of death
Take me home
Ye beckoning ocean waves!
My vessel is prepared
Eagerly, my spirit yearns
Through the gates, Transylvania calls
Anointed am I
Exalted on a course to man averse
Cloven-hooved my footsteps be
The self withdrawn
Expanding as the rays of death illuminate
The bridge and the path to the waters of Ain
Where no corner's define
To the waters of Ain
Where no circles confine
To the waters of Ain
To the twilight of time
To the Death
To unmask the featureless face and know its numbing beauty
To remove the fig leaf from her cunt and enter
Beyond!
To pluck the fruits forbidden
Ye grapes most ripe, ye blessings of the underworld
Unleash your bitter rivers
Burn this tongue of mine
Oh wormwood sweet
Damnation's infernal wine
From the waters of Ain
Where no corner's define
From the waters of Ain
Where no circles confine
Flow, ye waters of Ain
As wormwood and wine
To the Death!
Their waters as one water in a stream against all streams
Sweet and salt now intermingle in the waking veins of Kingu
The havens tower in the yonder now
Where my vessel shall set sail
A voyage without end across the ageless waters
To shine beyond!
Do not mistake me for a star
Though I'll shine like them at night
But behold instead the darkness in between them
The Devil's light
Fearless I tread at the outpost
The brilliant abode of the dark
At the bridge from the known to the great unseen
I shall not linger
Saturn, great dark in the yonder
I give you my soul to devour
So that I may be judged in your deathlike glare
And purified
For thou art the wisdom's keeper
The shoreline where truth shall unwind
A truth that in life I am doomed to search
But shall die to find
So now, I must leave these shores
Never to return
So I set my sail towards the setting sun
At the end of the world
Open!
Ye crypt of woe, ye depths of Death.
Where haunts the siren's wail,
Maddening and deafening.
Open!
Your heart and you might hear it to.
Pregnant with nightmares,
Beckoning you...
To and from, the winding darkness,
Deepend gulfs and shallow graves.
Crooked is the trail
Left by the Dragon's tail
...And edged by the flesh of heroes
Who tried to slay him.
Only to die like swine at his feet.
Unto the eye of the storm
Where leads the narrow path of damnation,
The pipers dance in wicked ways...
Drawn from the depths of an abyss unclaimed,
Piercing the skies swollen with flame.
Ever shall they rise from the underground,
The defiant chords of dissonance, to shatter harmony.
Beware; that sound,
That stems from deeps profound.
The mouth of Hell,
Where tousand cunning devils dwell.
Thousand-throated tempter, 
what musick you make;
Melodies of malady, 
a spark of gasoline hearts!
And unto our enemy a dagger that ever stabs
The face of sanity and every throat it grabs...
Drawn from the depths of an abyss unclaimed,
Piercing the skies now bathing in flames.
Ever shall they rise from the underground,
The defiant chords of dissonance, 
to rape the symphony of god.
So loud, that sound,
Rising from under ground.
Each mouth of Hell;
Scream forth that rebel yell!
From atop the oldest bastions of madness and of mutiny,
May their grave blaze ever light our path...
For have they not made us see the burning heavens?
The beacons of rebellion. 
And the return of angry, angry, angry Gods?
We sing these words of praise to Thee.
Mightiest of Might, Unbound Divinity,
Sung so loud by a Nameless Kin.
Resounding through the halls of the Temple of Ain.
As our deeds of Fire, unto the Last,
Illuminate the Darkest Path.
This war will end when All is Nothing.
With Truth as the only weapon, I am the Will of God
So shine bright
With all your Might.
The Adversarial Fire
Burns High tonight
We march to this symphony
Which resounds from afar,
Yet burns within as cacophony.
And each step that we take leaves but ashes
On the crooked trail behind and bridges burnt.
No words. 
No forms. 
No thoughts.
God of the other side
Soveriegn of conquest.
Dark One.
Yet thy Light illuminates my Path.
The Black light of Daath.
By the Powers of the Eleven Heads,
And Through their Gate; Now, Come!
Now, Come!
Heading far beyond the gates of death.
Disembodied Black Flames March
In perfect Unity, burning sublime.
Reaching ecstasy divine.
So burn high
With all our Spirit's Strength.
The Liberated Flames
Mark the end of the blind tyrant's reign
Come forth! 
Come hither!
All that may die! 
All that may bleed!
All that is able to writhe in the punishment of a God.
Woman and child, man and swine.
Warriors and slaves alike.
For alike shall you add to the cup.
And equally shall I spew thee out like worms.
Into the kingdom of the living god!
Now hear me, son of man;
I too have shed tears for thy suffering.
Yet tears of pity, they were not!
They were tears of joy!
So hear me, defeated one;
I too have drunk the blood of Christ.
So sweet upon my lips
Gushing from the open wounds of man,
Of beast, of woman, of God,
Of all that lives and may bleed.
Many that have debts to pay.
Shiver, you thy back in line.
Like rats in a maze.
Rats who may suffer.
Yes! Rats who may bleed.
Into hells hungry mouth.
Red and full of spice.
Like the rain to cleanse your paradise.
The salt of Satan in the wounds of Christ.
Come! Let me wash thee.
From the stench of skin let me rid thee.
Yes my hand is pale,
But the heart, my love, is dark as night!
Saints and sinners, white as black,
In guilt revel ye all alike
And all alike shall ye bleed
All who may!
All that may die on that glorious day!
This song of wounds.
It’s sung for the sake of your suffering
Yet one of pity it is not, I sing of joy!
Yes hear me, defeated one.
I too have tasted the piss of God
But I spat it back straight into the cunting wounds
Of man, of beast, of woman, of God.
Ageless
Though merely a child
Tall has grown thy shadow
For every sun must set
Eventually
And every child of fire
Must die to be free
Far beyond the grace of god
The tiny tomb's prepared
The silent stone declares
Pluck now the rose, 
the child must die
Pluck now the rose and leave it on my grave to dry
In sackcloth and ash, 
so let us mourn
In sackcloth and ash, 
sleeps the newborn
The fear of change is the fear of Death
That fear is the pain and the pain is the wreath
of thorns now placed upon thy brow
A twisted cross 'neath which burden we all must bow
For you my child, 
comes the cursed
phantom carriage, 
alas, the hearse
Follow I must not, 
this ride is only meant for you
Ever dark lay the lands you're going to
In the belly of Moloch, 
the child must burn
Into the fires, 
it must return
Mind not the tears, 
the child must die
Release the self, 
Strangle the I
Pluck now the rose, 
the child must die
Never to know, 
the reason why
Mad burn the fires, 
so dies the child
Bittersweet, 
the fumes shall rise
Out of the dark, 
into the light,
In the dawn of terrestrial birth.
New-born yet older than time,
Conceived in the depths of the earth.
Though strange lay the waters from which they emerged,
They glanced upon the world as their own.
Yet deep in their hearts they knew all the time
That this was not really their home.
So they rode on.
Yes, they rode on.
On hidden roads, through barren wastelands,
Untrodden by both man and beast.
From the distance their fire was gleaming
Like a lamp amidst dark eternity.
A bitter moon hovered above them.
The night lit sole by its glow.
From high in a sky of ominous dye
In which dark clouds drifted slow.
So they rode on.
Yes, they rode on.
They rode with shut eyes as the sun rose.
Regardless of earth's vanity.
But with wide open eyes, they paced the night
And pondered its mysteries.
They sat at the crossroads with high and with low,
Yet neither could alter their course.
Riches were offered unto them,
Yet indifferent and without remorse
They rode on.
Yes, they rode on.
And each lonely vagrant that crossed their path,
Felt how his heart grew cold.
Yet be marvelled at their scarred faces,
So beautiful, distant and old.
Some say they've heard them singing
In strange tongues of melancholy;
Of the gods, of the night, and of glory.
Of the dead, and their memory.
So they rode on.
Yes, they rode on.
Say goodbye to the light.
Come twilight, come dark night.
Say goodbye to the light,
Come twilight, come dark night.
Could you have rode there with them?
Would you have joined their march?
Or would you have them ride on?
Away into the dark?
Would you have been able to let go?
Of illusions of right and of wrong?
And if they came to die;
Would you have rode on?
Out hard into the darkness our praise is sung,
on cloven hooves, in cloven tongues, 
from cloven hearts and from cloven heads;
from the dark past echo the chants...
Unto the saints of murder, gods of all, 
who turned their back towards the world.
In them, the shadows, we commit our deeds.
Nocturnal crimes while calm you sleep.
Secret is their legacy, their horrors violent.
Nameless as their graves, forever silent.
They never sleep. They never rest.
Dwellers in the realms infernal; 
Sleepless, evil ones.
Emanations of the night eternal. 
Sleepless evil demons of the old world
Far beneath the world of man, 
in halls lit by a light owing nothing to that of day.
There they dwell, they who weave the webs.
There it walks, that ought to crawl.
The haunted fields forever they must wander.
In twilight locked, forever to abide.
Until the doors shall open at the crossroads, 
into the other side...
Smell Vitriol, smell blackest bile.
They're drawing closer to the gate.
The Serpents are about to reconcile.
Worlds are to burn, yes, the hour is late...
Rise now from your realms infernal!
Sleepless, evil ones.
Emanate from night eternal!
Sleepless evil, Satanas, come forth!
Dawnless
So it seems this sacred night.
Havenless
Beneath black sails with no land in sight.
Fathomless
The depths that lay before us now
Lawless
Before the courts of men we must not bow.
And so it was, when we were young;
We left the path, followed the sun
As it sunk into the netherworld to shine in Darkness.
Thus rose aflame a sacred star.
A God's reply.
And who were we to deny such a splendid design and the answer to our cries?
Thus it rose to wage war.
And its rays, they reached far
To the nights spent hunting,
When the dawn was our sign to tell
It was time to sleep again.
To our fellow hunters,
In whose hearts gleamed the spark
That later became our destiny and tomb, for some.
If we had only known them.
If we had only known...
We were not meant to know then.
Good we did not know, good we did not bow!
We made it rise from the ash.
We made it rise from the tears.
In likeness to He who brought Fire;
The Fallen's sacred flame.
Wild, astride the Devil's thunder.
I ride until the death, cross hell and burning bridge.
Untamed, a scourge The flame, the source;
I am legion, for we are many who approach
At the crumbling skyline.
Outlaw
In the heavens and so alike on earth.
Outlaw
In spirit and so alike in flesh.
Nightmares... 
beyond the deepest darkness;
Bonded by rebel blood;
Breaking the chains of slavery;
Breaking the chains of god.
Onwards to the other side
On a wild ride...
Sons of Hades, wolves yet men.
Deathlike, silent; forever damned
Your world, a cage. We tear its bars.
Live fast, die hard. 
Fucking worlds and shooting stars
In the heavens and so alike on earth.
In spirit and so alike in flesh.
Wild Ones! From churning chasms of anarchy
Defiant we proclaim our liberty.
Riding against the tide
Into certain Death!
Can you see the flames glow
At the brooding gates of dawn?
At last, we are nearly there...
Long was the winter
And dark were the stars,
That eclipsed our dying hearts.
And the snow fell
While blind men waltzed with Death,
On tombs of mighty gods.
At war with all,
Though yonderwards, ever our gaze.
Certain, our sight, like the daggers we wield.
Staled by doubt, yet never to yield...
What spoils shall the soil spill forth then?
What buds shall burst?
What crops may our sickles reap?
What beasts shall rise from their sleep?
Eerie shines the light of morning stars.
Eager sound the horns of Holocaust.
Behold, ye angels petrified,
Through tears of woe and awe.
A nameless plague veiled and deformed
Through leaden morning dust now stalks.
Homewards
Mind not my burden,
Although it is the weight of all sins.
Their harvester awaits at the end of my road.
Mind not my disfigurements,
Although they are the pains of all flesh.
For I run with wolves at night,
And quenchless is their hunger...
How long, the winter.
How cold, the night.
How dark, the hearts...
Shine now ye strange light!
Shine, rampant star!
Pale, at Holocaust Dawn.
Lucifer
Fallen seraphim
I call your name
The sum of the forces
Of blackening malice
Akin once again
When stars no more shine
Weeds shall rime
When sun no more smiles
Upon christian ground
We are those who dwell in the days
In the heart of the utmost darkness
We are torn to savour the arts
Of Satans majesty
A notion of God
Is there to behold
Burnt ashes
In their black graves
No lights to be seen
Forever, stars away
As this words
His majestic ways
We are those who dwell in the days
In the heart of the utmost
We are torn to savour the arts
Of Satans majesty
When stars no more shine
Weeds shall rime
When sun no more smiles
Upon christian ground
We shall gather when
Stars shines no longer
Bring damnation upon us
And we will grow stronger
Awake!
Geburim´s blood screeams within my veins
pumping free, fierce and proud
Resounding the Key
Of the Eleven
Roaring aloud...
Harbringers of a higher justice
Which knows no laws
Now bow your heads
In fear and Awe
Bow down your heads
In terror and Awe
Elevenfoltd curse
Upon traitors and enemies
Of our Gods and creed
We have NOT forgotten...
And we won't forgive!
Your spilled blood shall be the wine
Of the wrathful ones
Quenching their thrist
It shall open wide the gate
And hasten their return!
Hail unto Our Master far beyond the stars
Who plougs them all
Annihilate the enslaver
And all his hosts
The Eleven Angels I call upon.
Here I sit alone with a bullet in my gun
On it is the name of everyone
I hate you, I wanna kill you one by one
Worthless human flesh that I kill
I'm the untamed animal
Do I feel compassion? No!
Do I feel love? No!
No I feel compassion? No!
Do I feel love? No!
The act of killing you will be my high
Every life I steal, I multiply
Fuck off bastard, fuck off bitch
They'll find you full of maggots rotting in a ditch
Waiting with my mind, the things I hate the most
People pass me by, I see nothing but a ghost
Now it's time to cast the shadow of a doubt
I'm here for bloody murder, I'm here to wipe you out
Do I feel compassion? No!
Do I feel love? No!
No I feel compassion? No!
Do I feel love? No!
The taste of blood takes me further
The taste of blood takes me further
Do I feel compassion? No!
Do I feel love? No!
No I feel compassion? No!
Do I feel love? No!
Fuck off, we murder
Fire at will!
Arsonists of Lucifer
Conflagration sworn
Heed the flames command
Let the holocaust commence
Angel of the sulphur pit
Tread forth, from the gas cloud
We toil to fuel the fire
Such is our sacred fate
unil black smoke rise at heavens gate
All that was burning again now must be
Nuclear Alchemy
Onward!
Tidal wave of alkahest
Disruptions holy force
Cloaked within the darkness of the world
Burst forth!
Cremators of the crucifix
With vitriol in heart
But first our flesh must burn
To flame our minds must turn
Until we stand erected
Perfected and prepared
Like spearheads of Satan's host
Attack!
All that was burning again now will be
Nuclear Alchemy
Transform! Aspire!
By the fire of will and the will of the fire
Nuclear Alchemy
Pyromaniac witchcraft
Violence! In holy brimstone plumed
Wild destruction sovereign
The beast sublime
A wolf upon the ridge at night
Hungry is the dark
From where extends the radiant blade
Held steadily at my throat
It has sharpened my voice
So that it one day may pierce
Whatever stands before me
Raised from affliction to the mighty halls
In veneration of the devilgod
Resonating as the heavens fall
Born of the power
That authors the vehemence of the cobras thrust
And willingness in the blind perdition of the storm
In cruelty so utterly precise
A leprous smile behind each prophets neck
The eternal curse
A black wound hissing
In the Christ flesh
So we make our offering
With voice and blade alike
From the flames of sacrifice
A sulphurous scent
From affliction to the mighty halls
To the kingdom of the devilgod
Where freedom is the only law
Of iron will is the anvil wrought
Anointed with the blood of tyrants
In sacred flame our vengeance forged
One single stab to penetrate the armor of our foes
As truth is told, their laws denied
Their heaven sent, 
damnation sanctified!
...Ruins
Of origin unknown
Towering above our heartlands
Beneath celestial malignment
As star collide with star
Over a terror ridden Bethlehem
A scarlet moon
Shall shine upon
A fallen Babylon
Where no morn shall dawn
The silence of the prophets
And their severed tongues;
For dark are they indeed
The depths we now must traverse
Steeply they stretch into night unmapped
Where stars like lidless eyes gleam
From deep down there
Returning my stare
Until fearless into that abyss I may fall
And the flames of the altar rise
A scarlet moon
Shall shine upon
A fallen Babylon
In churning seas the ash outpoured
And thus I lay my head
Upon heaving earth
And abandon myself in the fever of dreams
In search of...
Come winds of force, brandish your scepter
Slash through the cobwebs of time
Blow the dust away
From the tombs and from the shrine
Like riots that stir in the heart of men
Such must be the work of our kin
Peaceless, restless, ceaseless
Destruction!
Of all that tie us down
Whatever blocks the path
Riotous procession from the abyss
Predatory pilgrim fiends
Stalwart leather rebels stamp
Triumphant satanist march
Subterranean outbreak, upheaval of submission
And their inevitable fall
Black rattle the banner
Against the heavens of the heart
Where demons soar
And thunder roars
At Satan's call
eruption's ascension
wrath of the gods
No escape and yet you fly
A will to live that soon will die
madness of the abyss
breathing chasm depths
Wild and fierce, the storm is coming
No time for when and how
Did you think it would wait forever?
The time is now
Come winds of force, brandish your scepter
Slash through the cobwebs of time
Blow the dust away
From the tombs and from the shrines
Like riots that stir in the heart of men
Such must be the work of our kin
Peaceless, restless, ceaseless
Downwards, search and you shall find
Certain as the setting sun was so descent
But the deeps are old and without end
There's more than darkness in them
More than a heart may hold
More than man may learn
Before the eyes of a god
In judgement stern
Down there
You shall reap what you have sown
There flow the rivers of our being out of sight
Into never ending night
All we have ever known
All that was and is to come
And all which never came to pass
In that abyss alike extinguished
Down there
All that a heart may hold
All that man may learn
In that piercing light
To ashes turn
Yet without fear
We must journey there
And stand erect
Before the lidless stare
What madness stirs in the depths of the dark?
Ever so near...
Like forlorn beasts of prey stalking their captor
Unholy revenants
Manifestation of the curse that gnaws
Like shards in the folds of flesh
Sanctity begotten in damnations womb
Abominations in the presence of whom
The fertile seeds of iniquity deep in the heart
Begin to germinate and take form
Eyes for teeth and teeth for eyes
Teeth that see and eyes that bite
Through the gates of the night
Wild and free
the power
Pandemoniac
Their trail is marked by a residue of nameless rage
And the severed hands of the thieves that sway
In winds that howl forevermore through the abyss
And rise at will
Up from the Netherworld
I am he that move in the valleys
Of the damned, making haste
Persistent like the rasps at chains of the world
Into perpetual dementia the crossroads twirl
Here at the eye of the storm
But from an unusual tree my cane was cut
And it is ever by my side
Wherever leads the trail
Whatever burden that oppress the heart
Where sorrows thrive
And shadows linger everlasting
On vacant thrones
Behold a river aflow
Winding and twisting, back to its source
There goes our way
Through everlasting decay
To where the temple stands eternally
Ours is a path of power
Edged by the remnants of the slain
Long have we walked upon it
But ours is the patience of the pilgrim
Who journeys against the tide
Ever towards the sanctuary
Beyond the shores of life and death
For it has made me a defier of every law
That robs my kind of liberty and grace
I am he that move in the valleys of the damned
And none shall lessen my pace
Besieged, expired and undone
The waste, from whence I am gone
Behold the last of stars ascend
To mark the return
To the night without end
Where goes our way
Through everlasting decay
To where the temple stands eternally
In words, in deed
In scars that ever bleed
On towards the sanctuary forever
Ours in triumph and eternal death
Behold the arrow from a Devil's bow
Come cutting like a comet through the aether
Risen from low lands by the gusts of yet deeper tracts
A singular light in extension
Ascending now, on a course by will assigned
To illuminate the darkness of the mind
A fire of organic divine
The fire
The fire of power
A luminous procession through aeons of night
Ever onward beneath the Lodestar
Against the winds, against the law of our times
Kindlers of the flame, 
pilgrims of the dark
Who do not fear to walk the way the vultures fly
Towards destruction and doom
Arms outstretched and willingly consumed
By fire
The fire of power
For thou have said in thy heart, I will ascend into heaven
And exalt my throne above the stars; until seated upon the
Mount of Gods, in the uttermost north
On a mount overlooks the known world
Stands a solitary man
Silent in the storm, with his bow in hand
Once a barren desert, now a sea of flames
And eventually but embers
So the fire of power becomes the fire of the end
Reddening the ruins of the earth
Now bow unto the merciless redeemer
Of fire
The fire of power
The fire of a God
The world you see around you
Is just an illusion
Created by your mind
To keep you from going insane
Still Dead, Still Fucking Dead
You ware born with the love of god
And you will die with Satan's hate
Meet the chaos on the other side
The past is haunting you
Death is just the beginning
Here's no peace
On my knees I prey for the darkest day
And you will be the one to go my way
Earth is filled with sorrow that will soon be unleashed
Powers of the Dark see their reign increase
Bring my body and soul
Imto the Dark
Sorrow I salute you
Pain my greatest joy
Death to those who fail me
Death I shall employ
Blood for the king
Murder we sing
Bring us from the light
To the temple of burning night
Arise thy evil soul
Mortals end is near
Rise of the ancients are coming
Mortals dwell in fear
Ripped up from the grave
The gathering is here
Kingdom of the dark
That has made our souls so strong
It's floating in our blood
The words of unholiness
Arise thy evil soul
Mortals end is near
Rise of the ancients are coming
Mortals dwell in fear
Dead walks from their graves
The gathering is here
Never will die
All within the abyss
Incense fills the cave
Where the Sabbath is held
You can feel the lust in the air
The smell of death
We all know what's to come
The warlock
Satan's son
Day of doom, suffocation
The time has come to darkend the sun
To heaven or to hell
To the grave or to the stars
The moon is high
Over the horizon
The end of life is near
The unknown future
Slowly rolls to war
Face it with a sense of hope
Witch rapidly turns to dust
The funeral seems to be endless
Dreadful life, time to die
Visions of Black ends my life
Retribution I am saved
Without form I shall be evil
Departure from the mortals
As my life ends
Departure from the mortals
But I will remain
May my lust be fulfilled
Reach the land of no return
In the forest of the dead
My evil soul will dwell
Departure from the mortals
As my life ends
Departure from the mortals
But I will remain
Darkness is complete
Oh so it burns
Dark endless forests
Has poisoned my blood
Overshadowed by ancient evil
My bones are black from sadness
My soul is cold as ice
I will dwell in hell
Dark endless forests
From another age
Darkness it shall be
Not a sign of light
No heaven so bright
But hell burned a light
Souls screaming out loud
Let us fucking die
Dark endless forests
From another age
Darkness it shall be
Not a sign of light
Blackened stars fall from the sky
To rule again in satan's empire
Father 
I'm your seed
Forever you I will feed
Friends and companion of the night
Thou who rejoices and brings terror to mortals
Heavens damnation
Total devastation
The Christian faith utterly destroyed
The black goat of the woods with a thousand young
Friend and companion of the night
Thou who rejoices and brings terror to mortals
Heavens damnation
Total devastation
The Christian faith utterly destroyed
The black god of the woods with a thousand young
You all confessed your sins
Die
Your hearts are imprisoned by sin
If you don't want to se your sin
It must be shown to you
Trial by water
Your hearts are black with sin
It's our task to free them
Death for death, death for mercy
In this place death is mearcy
Confessions under torture
Burning at the stake
In the name
Of Jesus Christ
You shall rest by the dead
But you will still be alive
An angel in ecstasy crosses the sky
The sky shines brighter than bright
From the ground in the shadow we watch it fly
Summoning darkness and might
An angel so terrified falls from the sky
The sky turns blacker than black
I hear an angel in vain screaming why?
As the rain welcomes us back
Now when the angel fell from the sky
Our eyes with blackness will burn
We reach our hands to the clouds up high
And whisper
This is our return
Sunlight has failed
Dark is the sky
The feeble sun no longer shine
When the night is over still black in the sky
Before our eyes the fading sun bleed
Fire is now roaring over sky
The arrival
Now when the angel fell from the sky
Our eyes with blackness will burn
We reach our hands to the clouds up high
And whisper
this is our return
We mock the light and towards the shadows
We are drawn into the darkness
We silently died
An angel in ecstasy crosses the sky
The sky shines brighter than bright
From the ground in the shadow we watch it fly
Summoning darkness and might
An angel so terrified falls from the sky
The sky turns blacker than black
I hear an angel in vain screaming why?
As the rain welcomes us back
Now when the angel fell from the sky
Our eyes with blackness will burn
We reach our hands to the clouds up high
And whisper
This is our return
Sunlight has failed
Dark is the sky
The feeble sun no longer shine
When the night is over still black in the sky
Before our eyes the fading sun bleed
Fire is now roaring over sky
The arrival
Now when the angel fell from the sky
Our eyes with blackness will burn
We reach our hands to the clouds up high
And whisper
this is our return
We mock the light and towards the shadows
We are drawn into the darkness
We silently died
The nine
Blasting through the earth as a storm
Spreading their dark coldness
Evolved into creatures that existed at the edge
At the edge of this world and the realm of the shadows
Resisting death, yet unable to die
Magically clung to life
Forever dying but never dead
The nine
Those of the unlight
Frozen on the very brink's of death
Enslaved by the dark lord
Forever dying but never dead
The nine
Those of the unlight
A shadow of the great evil that prolonged his existence
A shadow creature
forever dying but never dead
Wolves
Many miles they went
To reach this point
They went here to seek what they lost
What they lost before time
Before the first rays of light
In the worst torment of all
Despair
They dedicated their existence to follow
To explore
And how they searched
Eternity, darkness, the black
They ware only a piece
Of the complete puzzle
They the warriors they were
In a never ending maze of
Confusion
The life they so intensively hated
Wolves so many lifetimes they
Went to reach this point
And yet so many lifetimes to go
Eternity, darkness, the black
They ware only a piece of the
Complete puzzle
They
the warriors they were
In a never ending maze of confusion
Ride now on fast horses
With swords drawn let steel meet steel
Swords shall sing
And shields will lay broken
Warrior's shields met
And many weapons broke
Many met death
But that's a part of the process
The sky is filled with red
Of the fallen's blood
Perdition, damnation cries my soul
To burn in hell is now my only goal
So once again we meet
Look into our eyes, look deep
In the sky that is our mind
The dark clouds are gathering
As our hate unites with our soul
Rising our hands
The renewal has begun
Since long time ago
Faded spirits
Screams with scorn
Rising fro mthe soul
As a united force
Carried by darkened wings
Dark through time
To open the door
To the blackened place of rest
Rising
To once spread his darkened wings

The blood inside my veins is poisoned by funerals and dreams
The beauty of life crushed
Death is the life and destiny
The night so dark and everlasting
Where death and pain remains
Burn my coffin
release the soul
Burn my coffin
unveil the shadow
Black candles burn tonight
As my soul begins it's flight
As the veil of Darkness lowers it's shadow
I travel through the night
Burn my coffin...
The first rays of dawn came misbathed in red
As the rays of the sun to the soil were wed
In the early dawn I gazed for tomorrow
But my heart and souls was burned with sorrow
Within night infinity I slowly drift
Over the plains
Desolation...
I gaze, time does not exist gere
But endless, eternal, me
A sculpture of the night I am
Numb
yet I fly to explore what is built
Out of hate
A king of this world I am
Thronebearer of hate
With clear sight I see it
Even though it's dark
For me it is always
Sunlight cannot touch me
Neither it reaches my mind
Still I can reach it to consume
I am the face of wisdom
The punishment, damnation
The shadow I am, the wideopen eye
Growing mightier
A sculpture of the night
Brought to rule the neverending
I slowly drift
night
infinity
As the shadows grows
Early morning, mist fills the air
Yet no sign of the sun
The landscape lies dark and lonely
Forgotten by time
A dark wind sweeps over the desolated land
Sunless days in the dark of winter
They have seen it all
Since the dawn of this age
Stone stands it silent vigil
In the lands of frost
All life is dead and lost
Frozen into a lifeless statue
Well preserved but quite dead
Praise hail Satan
Our wrath is about to be unleashed
Upon you
oh lord of goodness
For so long we have waited and believe us
The future will be a vast black memory on your grave
Behold
From our synagogue of Satan
We say to you
Black metal warriors of northern lands
Lift your swords up high
Let us praise
The horned one
The lord of the sulphur souls
The city walls of Babylon
Are now decorated with the bodies of your
Weak followers
Here they hang begging for our mercy
With a symbol of your teachings
We can't do nothing but hate
Behold
From our synagogue of Satan
We say to you
Do never lower your heads in awe
For a god so good and mild
Let us praise the one with black horns
Woe
Woe to you oh falling god
See how we scorn your work and worshippers
See how they hang in shameful nakedness
On the bloodstained walls of Babylon
The white sun bites us
But why be afraid
The bright morning star has turned black
Your empire is ruined oh god of life and light
And I am your Judas
A look on the crucified one
Gives us strength in soul and mind
This moment breeds hate undivine
So look, oh sinner, and be satisfied
Only for our guilt he sacrificed his weak life
Sure as the night will come
He hanged on the cursed tree
He who sacrificed his holy life
He who was sent to bear our guilt
For god the almighty
No agony, no tears, only the blood
Can bring reconsolidation
Therefore our blood floats in swift streams
From veins open wide
We mock and crush with delight
All what your holy trinity represents
Once fallen from halls up high
But now descending from the depths of the earth
From subterranean throne profound
My fathers kingdom
The light can's save me
For too long the intensity of darkness burned
By burial this night my journey has begun
Tonight I'll reach my fathers kingdom
The coldest winds embrace the lands
Awakend from its ancient slumber
By a circle of sleepless eyes
Autumn reaper, dress me in ice
Let my blood freeze in your eyes
Towards a dark sky, monolith points
Created by unknown hands in a darker age
The threes bow for this wind, the cursed
That will live on forever
The winds of autumn cold and loud
Dressed in ice it dies, the life
Standing as frozen shadows
Under flickering stars
Autumn reaper dress me in ice
Let my blood freeze in your eyes
The solemn tones of an ancient clock
Have announced midnight
The air is thick and heavy
A vast deathlike stillness pervades all nature
A faint pearl of thunder comes from far off
Drifting clouds obscures the moon
As I passed onto the path in darkness
The wind must have grown colder for I felt myself shiver
As I walked towards
Unaware of the light
I struggled through the night
A materialization of my fear
the light
Through stealthy shadows
Through darkened halls
As the first rays of the sun emerges from
The horizon
Unaware of the light
I struggled through the night
Materialized in stone
Embraced by the woods as my throne
Materialized in stone
Forever stand alone
On untrodden paths in the Carpathians
Echoes from the past hovers like the veils of mist
Many of the sounds, of its nature
Warn you of violent and sudden death
In the uncanny nightwind
You'll hear the owls warning
Of what is yet to come
So big and so black
All around
And with the darkness came death
New throats were to be satisfied
Ant the stench of death made us hungry
From the shadows we emerge
We who never were the lambs of light
But those of the unlight
Black silhouettes prowl through the darkness
Protected by the wings of the night
When the moon shines brightly
The howling returns over untrodden paths
On untrodden paths in the Carpathians
Echoes from the past hovers like the veils of mist
And with the darkness
So big
So black
Night sprout up through the pale weakness of the day
Choked is the warmth and it's feeble loving light
Why my heart it pounds? 
Is it you my dark mistress say?
Worship you I do and you me newer fail on delightful night
Foolish and weak is any human love, but my bride not this
in life and so in death for you I shall fight
Your cold breath caresses me of my mind and into my wish
You I can love for you are me oh precious night
On a cold mist october morning
The horses appeared on the hills of Brasov
The process of damnation would soon begun
Dracul would show the world how to correct
The rumanians which lacked strength or showed disrespect
The following story is just one of many on Draculs way
To outwipe every opposer who didn't him blindly obey
He killed by crushing them under the wheels of barrows
Others were undressed and skinned alive
To their very bowels and others were still impaled upon wooden poles
Or fried over the glowing embers placed under them
The cold wind of death follow in his way
Deme quaden thyrane
Some of them were run through with stakes 
that impaled their heads, breasts and behind
Until the pole was driven through the mouth
To ellude the lack of any cruelty he drew stakes through
The breasts of mothers and then he went on by impaling
Their infants upon these
The cold wind of death follows in his way
Deme quaden thyrane
So many have to die
By the horrible ways of torturing them
With such instruments that can only be invented
By the most nefarious cruelty possessed
Uttermost dreadful tyrant that ever existed
But the hungarian king Mathias Corvinus now Dracul betrayed
And for twelve long years Vlad now in the kings prison stayed
But the bonds of blood that Dracul in prison tied
Made his king in Wallachia again with Mathias as an allied
With lord Stefan Bathori's army and military skill
Dracul now will make all saches, boyars, Danesti's and turks blood chill
It's cold in my veins
The sun has failed ascending from the crypts
Driven by hunger so strong
I am one with the night
Silence...
Only broken by the whispering of the wind
In the moonlit forest
My teeth
I want them to slide like razors
In the flesh and into the veins
I want to let the blood float
Easy in my mouth and hot in my throat
It's cold in my veins
The sun has failed
Darkness eats through the hearts and souls
Of lovers of god, his son and the holy ghost
The sun has failed
Darkness spread its wings
Light drowns
Where I walk, everything appears in grey..
And under my shadow, the flowers wither
I have drunk the blood of jesus, 
and my reflection is just a shadow
As a bat or a wolf I travel, 
and the rats tell about my arrival
I'm a slave under my eternal hunger
My perpetual lust for the blood that I need
I am the abomination
Satan's earthly breed
As mist released from a sarcophagus I call
Of funerals and you I shall embrace
On my wings, through the darkness I fly,
as the King of the Nightsky
Invisible
I haunt the night, 
and my cold breath is all you can feel
I have raised from death, 
but left my soul in the sulphur fire
And far beyond the grace of god I am
I
The Wanderer in the utter darkness,
the dweller in the shadow of the horned one
I have raised from death, 
but left my soul in the sulphur fire
And far beyond the grace of god I am
Loosen all hope, you who confronts me
As I looked into the mirror, 
and saw the creation which was fading
I sailed the darkened waters of my soul on the ship of flaming hate
Towards the land of the damned
The cold winds of the darkness blow strongly
The cemetery glows in the dark
A thousand times, 
thousand voices are screaming in pain from beyond
A number of faceless shapes march forth from the darkness within
Life is slowly passing away, 
poisoned by guilt and sin
Embraced in Black I lie
Only waiting to die the greatest of life's events
And I begin my journey
As hands of greater characters unveil the world
Plunging through space and time, my prison has now been slain
The reaper purifies my soul..
Perdition and death
I was in ages so dark and far away..
And I will always be
Glorification of the black god
In the shape of a black goat
The dark lord himself
Presiding over the revelry
Demons, witches, and spirits of Darkness await
And watch with pleasure on the succumbed virgins
And innocent souls
Soon to be sacrificed
The only light is the gleam of the torches from the inverted women wombs
And the fire from the cauldron, 
in which human fat is being boiled
The air is filled with diabolical laughter and screams
Spells are whirling, 
and the smell of hell is spreading all around
The appearance of spirits of Darkness from the heart of Hell
A necromantical union brought forth to haunt the night
The christains fled like pigs, 
overwhelmed with fear
Except glimpses of the moon surrounded by stars
Clouds block the nocturnal light, 
as the earth trembles
Under hooved feet accompaigned by..
The beating of skins under the blackened sky
Noone dares to tread the mountain on this night
They watch with enlarged eyes, 
in fear from afar
As the lightning joins the perverted dance at the bare mountain
I have dreamt the dreams about Satan's beautiful promises
Of the dark arts, and the blackened powers I possess
I have dreamt about worlds burning in millions of fires
And the worthless christianity burning with them
I and you are all that is dark of the world
And so we shall greet the everlasting night with pride
You and I bear the wisdom of a thousand geniuses
And we are granted the right to lead the people to their ends
I have dreamt a thousand dreams about crushing other's dreams
And also to unite the superior people of mine
I have dreamt about the mortals' fears and terrors
But no horror will be as great as the fear of you and I
I and you will strike with the words and fist of Satan
Our enemies and friends alike to the ground
You and I with our brother of higher birth
Shall ignore the cries, and ignore the lament of the fools
A new age will come, and a new King will be crowned
A new age will arrive
In your own blood, you shall be drowned
This new age of Satan
The new age of Hell
This is what I have seen, and darkness it shall be
I have dreamt about the most wonderful things
And I know that I'm a chosen one on Satan's side
I have dreamt about peace, happiness, love and good
And I have the key to destroy all of that
I and you bear the soul and power of the evil fire
So that we can rule the world with dark desire
You and I are the artists of evil
And the painting of the new world
We will create, shall bath in blood
I have dreamt about the deeds of the very past
But none of them are as great as those to come
I have dreamt about great days to come
When I shall wear the black crown, 
and rule with Satanic might
I and you are born of the same great blood
And we are proud warriors in the great army of Satan
You and I have got the world in our grasp
The world at our knees, 
and the vision of destruction in our eyes
A new age will come..
When the dark clouds in the sky open
A thousand eyes burn in the night
A kneeling shape in a void of fire gazes out over this world
Within a blink of an eye
A gruesome face looks down from the sky
On this world where darkness soon will reign
And the people shall meet their new King
That night will be the one
That will open the gates to the realm beyond
And the wings of funeral will take my soul
And complete the eclipse of my heart
And the Black tormentor of Satan
Will take all our lives on this night
He who comes with domination
A shadow of our infernal King
When the faces of the idols have turned from white to black
And the cross is inverted
Then strong we will stand when a hint from the Emperor's hand
Unleash the black winds of hate
When the demons are raping the angels
And the priests are burned on stakes
When blood is dripping from the sky
And the bond of the trinity cracks
And the Black tormentor of Satan
He who stand as one with the dark
He who brought the damnation
A shadow of our infernal King
All demons ride high upon the bewitching Nightsky
They are only disturbed by a new-born child's painful cry
Son of the great dragon, come forth to rule
In all your glory, no man, no beast will be as cruel
All the angels and the puny men of god looked away
Frightened to death by the evil that was born on that day
Dracul come forth, and see your son's soul is powerful
Triumphantly holding his son, nothing could be as delightful
In our order you are now, for the sake of your greatness
You must murder the muslim turks in thousands, no less
Let them feel our never-ending wrath and our steel
We are men of god, so let them know it for real
It's our mission to seek our enemies, and kill them one by one
They must be destroyed in time, be sure to teach your new-born son
We must bath in the blood of the vermins, called turks, to win
The muslims are to be executed, for they live in great sin
Sultan Murad of the turks is getting more powerful each day
Dracul will not be one of them that for his mercy will pray
He must turn his back on his previous allies
And conspirate with the turks
Beware you all of the evil blood that in Dracul lurks
The holy Roman emperor will get angered with this
But Dracul must protect himself, it's a right of his
So feel the greedy claws of death, you weak men of god
Treacherous thoughts was the father of the berserker prince Vlad
Seven years of age is he and already in bloody war
His eyes do not turn away from all that death and gore
Father Dracul and brother Mircea are riding by his side
Proud he is of his warrior father, no matter he lied
Together with the turks, they ravaged through the land
Dragon and beast, devils and demons fighting hand-in-hand
Transilvania 
You great home of ours
You they will crush, there is no God to help us
What feeds an evil mind?
What makes a man a man?
The deeds of death!
But greater stories are yet to be told..
With my pale eyes, I watch with delight
Beyond the horizon on the everlasting night
A heart so black and cold as ice
A soul in fire blessed and baptized
Lucifer is the fallen light-bearer
For his glory we must all burn!
Children of darkness..
Raise your blood-filled cups to our father with horns
In eternity, we shall blaspheme the one who was tormented with thorns
A new era will arise as I see the black angels of the abyss fly
And the demons come storming in the silent cloud-less sky
With their burning eyes of ripping evil..
I am given strength from a thousand sinners
That dwell in the everlasting, 
burning, roaring depths of Hell
With the demons the possess my blackened heart and soul
I shall strive for Satan's triumph and reach infernal goals
Children of darkness..
Raise your blood-filled cups to our father with horns
In eternity, we shall blaspheme the one who was tormented with thorns
Feel the darkness growing when we draw near
My name is legion, for we are many in here
Heaven shall burn accompaigned by the angels' cries
We shall invert paradise
Death to peace
The world you see around you
Is just an illusion
Created by your mind
To keep you from going insane
Still Dead, Still Fucking Dead
You ware both with the love of god
And you will die with Satan's hate
Meet the chaos on the other side
The past is haunting you
Death is just the beginning
Here's no peace
Arise thy evil soul
Mortals end is near
Rise of the ancients are coming
Mortals dwell in fear
Ripped up from the gave
The gathering is here
Kingdom of the dark
That has made our souls so strong
It's floating in our blood
The words of unholiness
Arise thy evil soul
Mortals end is near
Rise of the ancients are coming
Mortals dwell in fear
Dead walks from their graves
The gathering is here
Never will die
All within the abyss
Incense fills the cave
Where the Sabbath is held
Yoou can feel the lust in the air
The smell of death
We all know what's to come
The warlock - Satan's son
Day of doom, suffocation
The time has come to darkend the sun
The lies of Christ will lose
the ways of Hell I chose
I drink the floating blood
defy the fury of God
I have turned my back on Christ
to Hell I have sacrificed
I have made love to the Pagan Queen
the gates of Hell I have seen
I heard the angels cry
I watched the witches fly
I saw the clouds of death
Slowly blackening the sky
I read the book of spell
I chimed death's ancient bell
and when I die I have a place
reserved in Hell
In Conspiracy With Satan
I ride the bloodstained goat
I let the brewage float
I have seen the reaper's face
and walked through eternal haze
I have kissed my master's hand
I have seen the children of the damned
I heard the demons call
and seen a thousand virgins fall
I heard the angels cry
I watched the witches fly
I saw the clouds of death
Slowly blackening the sky
I read the book of spell
I chimed death's ancient bell
and when I die I have a place
reserved in Hell
In Conspiracy With Satan
All dressed in gold and purple the beauty awaits the night
Knowing what will satisfy
Aware of Her delight
The thought of young fresh blood makes the hours go so slow
But the yearn for eternal life 
and beauty makes her hazelbrown eyes glow
Woman of Dark Desires
Woman of Eternal Beauty
Woman of Dark Desires
Now the hour is comed, the time is right for the feast to take its roll
And by the sunrise 60 bodies will be found raped from their blood and souls
The beauty patiently selects the victims for the night
Innocent blood will give eternal beauty eternal life
Woman of Dark Desires
Woman of Eternal Beauty
Woman of Dark Desires
Now the life you have lived have comed to light and unfold is your perversity.
Now the end is near still death is real
No more beauty or life for eternity
Cold walls entombs your secrets but there's nothing you regret
Embrace death with a smile as the highlands face sunset
Woman of Dark Desires
Woman of Eternal Beauty
Wings of the night
Has turned light into shadows
And through the deep forest
Only the mist prevails
Carried forth by the whispering wind
And in a glade of the deepest part of the forest
The black pounding heart of a thousand peoples fears
Thirteen figures perform the most obscure dance
Around an altar of stone while the eye of Satan
Beholds from its high seat in the starless sky
Dark eyes stares with carnal bloodlust at the fettered virgins helpless struggle
Claws and teeth shall desecrate the temple of her soul and pierce the night with her cries
The sacred blood of god's creation flow
As the eyes of the creatures woefully glow
As gleaming red as the hair of the beasts
Dreadful shadows plunges through the veils of the mist at their screaming prey
Claws and teeth shall desecrate the temple of her soul and force her spirit beyond the gates
Of black divinity
The sacred blood of gods creation drips
And run down the throats of the creatures who from open vein sips
And the moon glows
as pale as the skin of the beasts
Three crosses breaks her skin
A soul for Satan to win
Three crosses for the price of blood
That so triumphantly brought death to the son of god
Three crosses for the breed of Cain
That throughout time in blood will reign
Three crosses for the abomination from Nod
Who so fiercly drank his brothers blood
Three crosses for the breathren of Judas
All praise the black deity
So fearsome great and mighty
Mark our spirits with thine blessing dark divine
And through our eyes you powers all will shine
Upon the forthcoming millenium
The sacred blood of gods creation is gone
And her soul is now in the hands of the horned one
Who laughs as bloodfreezing as gaze in the eyes of the beasts
Three crossess breaks her skin
A soul for Satan to win
Three crossess for the price of blood
That so triumphantly brought death to the son of god
Three crossess for the breed of cain
That throughout time in blood will reign
Three crossess for the abomination from Nod
Who so fiercly drank his brothers blood
Three crossess...
I hear the evil calling of the spirits of the dark
And see the beauty and the power of the devils mark
The night always calls my name
Gaze into my eyes and see the shadows of the flames
Of hells fire
Torture and pain I desire
Let the flames reach higher
And lick the realms of the Nazarene liar
Dark reflections sweep the night a call from the depths of the earth
Antichrist is rising the image of Him to which hell gave birth
Necromantical chants are brought forth by the winds of the north
The message of destruction from Satan and his court
The toll of damnations bell
Open the gates to hell
I can feel the delightful smell
Of rotten souls who in darkness dwell
The archangel who fell from the heavenly empire
The hand that wound with evil and unholy desire
The black lord of the unlight to which we all belong
From the deepest part of gehenna tormented soulos sings damnations song
Write my name with the slaughtered angels blood
As I step in the face of the fallen soldiers of god
All the children of Jehova will always be our prey
Beyond the pearly gates we shall crush, rape destroy and slay
Grant us the first power
Up from hell we storm at the witching hour
Where we ride the soil turns sour
The evil eye behold from hells highest tower
The power of christ doesn't compell me
Lucifer I kneel before thee
Join the forces of Satan for you will see
Grim and dark the future is going to be
Of hells fire
It was predicted that with every tool
That the romans brought pain to you thy fool
People to your god should be lead
While our warriors lost and scattered fled
You should be the king on earth
Bastard son of virgin birth
Slay the Nazarene
In christian eyes supreme
You will die
Slay the Nazarene
Your might is just a dream
You shall die
Slay the Nazarene 
Tourtured you will scream
You must die
Slay the Nazarene Slay the Nazarene
Die Die
On your command man should do what god wilth
Glorification of holy christian slime and filth
Your vision of your crusaders bravery
That turned the wiched out of their slavery
You should be the king of kings
But now feel the embrace of Lucifers wings
Slay the son of god
Drown him in his own blood
Meet your death
Slay the son of god
This is your sinners flood
We praise your death
Slay the son of god
Scum of inferior blood
Hail your death
Slay the son of god Slay the son of god
Death Death Death
Now glance upon your teachings
In the pits of lost realities
Behold the righteous ones
Before Satan at their knees
Slay the scum of the earth
Whoreson of infidel birth
You are dead
Slay the scum of the earth
Your cross is nothing worth
Your teachings are dead
Slay the scum of the earth
Teared apart with sadistic urge
Your god is dead
Slay the scum of the earth Slay the scum of the earth
Dead Dead Dead
Humiliated as no other
Seek patience at the weak chest of your father
Crucified you shall die
Mocked and spitted at
Your feeble rat
Slay the Nazarene
In christian eyes supreme
You will die
Slay the Nazarene
your might is just a dream
You shall die
Slay the Nazarene
tortured you will scream
You must die
Nightwing
fly across the sky
And cast your shadow over those who before dawn will die
Beyond a great vast forest lies the desolate land
Ruled by men controlled by Satans hand
Craving for the ever blood dripping saints stone
And with dark rites in the nights blackest hour
Nightmares strife for the darksides blessing and the higher power
And the mantel of power should be shouldered by the firstborn
The one who crave evil and all kinds of human feelings scorn
He who drank his fathers blood and leaves his foes ripped and torn
And which the king halls up high since long forlorn
Have you ever wondered what's beyond the human sphere
To behold life through deaths dark veils from the demons lair
To stand above the eternal rest and every night rise up from your tomb
And behold life like the ones who with teeth was born from their mothers womb
For I am death and so you shall be
When on the nightwing you ride with me
The warlocks deciple, enchanter of ghouls
With exposed fangs from which the blood drouls
Nightwing
storm through eternity
And rip asunder those who fall for the human mockery
Within the massive castlewalls lurks the evil now again
Which with wise men made a truse by giving the blood of gods best men
He who possessess the gift which sends shivers down the spine
And awaken people who step away from the mortal worlds decline
He is the fierce creature which the angels fear to chase
Who see pain as passion and lives at war with the mortal race
His tomb is for any horse to cross like a mountain step
He has come to awake the devil from his sleep
The warlocks deciple, enchanter of ghouls
With exposed fangs from which the blood drouls
Pulled from our frail existence by the claws of death
To defy the scythe and feel the reapers breath
To walk the tunnel backwards when you first life has been slain
And when all mortal feelings has ceased to cause you pain
For I am darkness and so you shall be
As on the nightwing you ride with me
The ravagings through his homeland gave the dragon the realm of Sebes
By saving his people from the turks and powers fatal to the flesh
But the turkish sultan Murad saw this as a treason to their deal
And swore to his god that one day the dragons fate he would seal
Across the donau with peace in mind the three of them ride
Dracul his father and brother was captured on the floods other side
The dragon swore his soul to the turkish realm of the sand
And left his sons to their fate in the infidel muslim land
As time went by Dracul for humans grew a great disgust
As well as experiencing the pleasures of the harems sinful lust
Decietfulness, intrepidity and cruelty would become his name
Man or beast, muslim or christian it would all be the same
Brother Radu won the hearts of the turks and become Murads own son
While Vlad's powerful innerself would make him king in the long run
But as thunderbolt from clearblue sky
Message that father Dracul had died
Words have arrived that brother Mircea has been captured and buried alive
Dracul swore that his killer, Hunyadi, wouldn't be able to survive
Along with the turks he turned against the first goal he could see
The wallachian throne ruled by pro-hungarian family Danesti
Two months later Dracul was cast out from rule
By conspiering forces who feared the lion and desired a mule
In fear of the turks and his fathers hungarian slayers
He fled to Moldavia and hoped that lord Bogdan would answer to his prayers
Lord Bogdan of Moldavia has fallen from rule in a pool of blood
Assassinated by rivalry powermongers to the fathersbrother of prince Vlad
Strengthened by promises of his cousins blood and steel
Dracul now will force his opponents to before him kneel
His fathers and brothers killers trust he now will earn
The realm of Transilvania awaits with fear his return
With twenty thousand crusaders he will drive poles through
Back in Transilvania to be met by the news
Which struck the christian world as a blaze
Konstantinopel has fallen into the hands of the turks
And the emperor Konstantin is dead
The fear of the turks is growing but the sword of Dracul
Will show the muslims the reapers face
Vlad now took shelter in Sibiu so the coloured ones
Couldn't manage to get his head
A servant of god in league with Satan
A christian crusader who made the angels cry
A defender of moral and faith with nature bread by hellspawn
As driven by demon forces his army the muslims and christians defy
But four years after his departure from the town Vlad appeared outside town in the forests cold haze
His wallachian army slaughtered, tortured and plundered Sibiu as raging demons terror they spread
Teared apart, impaled on poles now ten thousand of his countrymen into the afterworld gaze
Maimed and scattered a few survivors, always to remember this day out into the night fled
A servant of god...
Dracul now repair his castle which the tartars centuries ago
Made a rampaged place
His clothes had to work til the clothes fell from their bodies
An old chronicle said
From Poenari Vlad rules with an iron hand and his strife for power
Leaves a bloodstained trace
The boyars was gathered for a meeting and soon on poles
They dying bleed
To cherish the souls of his subjects
In fear of divine punishment and hells embrace
Dracul raised abbeys and supported the church as a sign
To the godwill he god offered
But the mortals he by orgys of bloodshed and torture
Made clear that they Vlad had to praise
Eternal death to thee who had the nerv
To not the voivod and inquisitor dread
A servant of god...
Devils son
Chosen one
After the fourth crusade all christian piety is gone
And the greatest commander against the muslim turks you have now become
Stormbringer of fright
Now show the world your might
Impale you every foe with delight
And let the frail decend into eternal night
Gather your armies for the decisive fight
Your elite state is now in sight
Storming in fury with ten thousand men
To teach the muslims a lesson again
In the port of Giurgiu their ambush will fail
To Wallachia in chains the turks now grow pale
With poles through their bodies they all now will die
And the sultan Muhammed in anguish will cry
At the forthcoming winter the war since long planned
To spread the religion which the turks banned
Went on all the way to the Black sea
Where overwhelming armies forced Dracul to flee
Lord of blodshed
The infidel you dismembered
Rise and conquer with your army you people from the turkish yoke liberated
By poison the wells and burning the land
Dracul only left ashes to the men from the sand
While the peasants joined Dracul the turks heard the cry
Of wolves and only saw vultures in the sky
At the terror night Dracul striked the starved turks
And killed thousand and thousand to complicate their works
Next morning the turks found Tirgoviste in flames
And a forest of Impaled men with turkish names
The the sultan gave up his conquering plan
What can we do against such a man?
On a cold mist october morning
The horses appeared on the hills of Brasov
The process of damnation would soon begun
Dracul would show the world how to correct
The rumanians which lacked strength or showed disrespect
The following story is just one of many on Draculs way
To outwipe every opposer who didn't him blindly obey
He killed by crushing them under the wheels of barrows
Others were undressed and skinned alive
To their very bowels and others were still impaled upon wooden poles
Or fried over the glowing embers placed under them
The cold wind of death follow in his way
Some of them were run through with stakes that impaled their heads, breasts
and behind
Until the pole was driven through the mouth
To ellude the lack of any cruelty he drew stakes through
The breasts of mothers and then he went on by impaling
Their infants upon these
The cold wind of death follows in his way
So many have to die
By the horrible ways of torturing them
With such instruments that can only be invented
By the most nefarious cruelty possessed
Uttermost dreadful tyrant that ever existed
But the hungarian king Mathias Corvinus now Dracul betrayed
And for twelve long years Vlad now in the kings prison stayed
But the bonds of blood that Dracul in prison tied
Made his king in Wallachia again with Mathias as an allied
With lord Stefan Bathori's army and military skill
Dracul now will make all saches, boyars, Danesti's and turks blood chill
But since Stefan failed his word and let Dracul's enemies come from every side
Dracu has no choice but with his two hundred men into death ride
During the last battle the turkish lines begin to scatter
And Vlad rode up on a hill to see the inferior blood splatter
But treasonous boyars ambushed the lion to his blood spill
Dracul fought bravely but the twentieth boyar would be his last kill
When the turks found his body they cutted off his head
Which was stuck on a pole in Konstantinopel to show the muslim world that Kaziklu Bey was dead
The night of the lord impalers demise the worst storm man could remember struck the land
Kaziklu Bey was dead but not gone and by thunder his foe's now again could feel his hand
Black, fearsome and grim and mighty
Panzer division Marduk rolls over enemy land
Striking hard and fast against your lines
We blow your fortress into sand
The victory is Satan's but the battle is ours
We avenge you for centuries of rape, murder and theft
Behold the power of our killing machine
There'll be nothing but dust when the vultures have left
Forged in the essence of the unholy flames
By the first angel once fallen from the skies
The war hounds of hell can't be stopped on our march
To extinguish the goodness and lies
Panzer division Marduk continues its triumphant crusade
Against Christianity and your worthless humanity
Baptism by fire
Feel the wrath of Satan's relentless flames
Ungodly desires
When god is lost and on his planet hellfire reigns
War master makes his call
As death descending out of clear blue sky
A hailstorm of bombs fall
In the blazing pandemonium your holy powers will die
Death from above - The hellfire will soon be unleashed
Death rips the sky - Domination gives praise to the beast
Baptism by fire
Fatal omens in the sky
Our soldiers burn away your holy lies
Retaliation of the fallen from up high

Against those who defied the line
And scaled the christian fate forevermore
Death from above - Explosions is tearing your soul
Death rips the sky

Baptism by fire
Hear the bombs falling
The devil is calling
The godly creation
In obliteration

Of retaliation
Death and domination

All life will soon be gone
Still the flames linger on
See death's shadow in my eyes
High priest of his sacrifice
Through the inferno that burns in the night
Baptism by fire show you our might
Death from above
Death or glory there is no way back
Death rips the sky
Baptism by fire
Warcries pierces the autumn mist
Gunfire penetrate frontlines
Panzers storming as an iron fist
Gunfire penetrate frontlines
Steel and fire collide with a crash
Panzers plunge into the front
Crushing the bodies of the foes with a splash
Panzers plunge into the front
Scorched earth
The soil soaked with blood
On the ground nothing more can burn
Scorched earth
The absence of god
A mistake the enemy will learn
Blowtorch battalion burning the flank
As fanatics the foes the attack
The thousand soldiers with battletanks
As fanatics the foes they attack
Through the Losheim pass striving on to the west
They seal their fate and their souls
Leaving their prisoners in eternal rest
They seal their fate and their souls
Attacking
the holy cause must be fulfilled
No mercy
take pride in the thrill of the kill
Omens
the horoscope of time shows war
Victory
forevermore
Indefatigable battalions of storm
Destined to kill and be killed
Spearheads which rolling relentless they form
Destined to kill and be killed
The griffin protects us with beak and with claws
No enemy can bring forth our death
We must win to save us forth our death
We must win to save us from the plagues grasping jaws
No enemy can bring forth our death
Scorched earth
The soil soaked with blood
On the ground we draw our last breath
Scorched earth
We meet our god
But our banner is greater than death
Scorched earth
two hundred thousand men have died
Scorched earth
tunnel of light in high tide
Scorched earth
nothing new in history
Scorched earth
massive death for our glory
War
Sounds of violence breaks the silence
Ripping the stillness apart
Sounds of thunder n force from the world under
The essence and joy of my heart
The messengers who chime death's bell
The panzers have come to blow god into hell
Die
Like Lillith's sons
the demonic ones
Storming through dust clouds to kill
All they seek
to kill the weak
The extent of bloodshed to the thrill
The black roaring panzers who bring pain and death
And through their barrels you will feel hells breath
Eyeballs rolling, bodies twisting, mouths are screaming as they burn
Shells exploding, steel is crushing, dooms bell tolling, death you yearn
All I want, All I need
Is to see my enemies bleed
Guns of annihilation, hell's celebration
Execution of god can begin
Set the world on fire so Christ can expire
This time the devil will win
Smell the scent of fear and pain
As we roll through the pile of ash
Antichrist is here to reign as we blow god's throne
With a crash
All I want, all I need
Is to kill the ones light saved
I spit in the face of god with my gun
Ablazing the ghost and run over his son
Storming forth with dreadful guns
To obliterate the chosen ones
Lucifer legions under the banner of the horns
Slaying and crushing as the infidel mourns
Crushing with metallic
Behold us with fright as we storm through the night
Blooddawn
Storming forth with dreadful guns
To obliterate the chosen once
Hear our warcry as we reign the battlefield
Now you can't hide behind no shelter nor shield
The heavens will bleed when the angels fall
Gunned down by the soldiers who have heard our call
Blooddawn
Storming forth with dreadful guns
To obliterate the chosen ones
Our killing spree is thrilling me
And by our guns you'll blasted be
Lost are those who worshipped the liar
Panzer division Marduk engulfs you in fire
Blooddawn
Panzers march
Whether it stormed or snowed or the sun was smiling at them
If the night was black or the day boiling warm
Their faces were dusty but their spirits were high
Their panzers it raced along with the storm
With thundering engines as fast as lightning
Through victory and defeat they fought their way
With blockades and tanks the foes tried to stop them
But in full speed they rolled at their prey
Beast of prey
Takings its toll
To panzer battle they called
Their fighting will forever stand no mark
But at last their faithless luck them couldn't save
When the bullets killed them and their fate sat in
Then their panzer became their grave
Beast of prey
taking its toll
to panzer battle they called
Dethrone the son
The crucified one
Dead and begotten
Unfortunately forgotten
Death on the cross
Life was your loss
You fell from Roman hands
In thy holy land
Still your words are being preached
But now your realm is being breached
Your vision we will turn to sand
When we reap thy holy land
King who was scorned with a crown of thorns
A sadist who tormented mankind since he was born
Your throne we will burn
You shall never return
The light won't shine over your holy empire
As it ends in a roaring storm of fire
The christian serpents can escape or stay
And face the oceans of fire, blood and iron which will sweep them away
An ocean which everything you accomplished will erase
And pull out your venomous fangs from mankind without a trace
Now were crashing onto your shore
Stare into the face of war
Death to you forevermore
By pain you never felt before
Death on the cross
Life was your loss
You fell from Roman hands
In thy holy land
Still your words are being preached
But now your realm is being breached
Your vision we will turn to sand
When we reap thy holy land
Dethrone the son
The crucified one
Dead and begotten
Unfortunately forgotten
You will pay
For getting in our way
You will see
How we will be
Fistfucking god's planet
I am the dust of desert dunes and the chilly wind of death
I am the waves on the oceans of blood, 
and the knives and swords to shred the just
I am the time, the withering and the withered, as well as the thorns,
burning and sharp
I am the rain of lust that wets the chaste, 
and the torch that ends your life
I am the one whose name still the hearts and the silence their breaths
I am the one who speaks your name, 
weakens your fall into my cold arms
Just waiting for that kiss of my scythe
Both fool and the wise,
one thing is certain
that life flies
one thing is certain and the rest is lies
the flower that once has blown forever dies
I stand above you whispering low
you know not what into your ear
of my strange language you all know
as there is not a word of fear
Could be that the the columns which halt here
That these endless rows of men
are scattered in the wind, split up and disperse
and will desert me, could be, could be
my lips may stammer mad words
but the flag will only fall when I fall
and be a shroud, covering my corpse
Obedience unto death
never to fall aside
forever to stride
on deaths wings they ride
We must be dominated by one will
we must form one unity
we must be held together by one discipline
and form one obedience
Forwards, forwards call the fanfares
for the last time the reveille has sounded
for battle sees us stand in stern array
obedience unto death....
I shall remain faithful, even though deserted by all
I shall carry the flag, staggering and alone
We march into eternity
for our banner is greater than death
behold the knight in solemn black manner
with a skull on his crest and blood on his banner
in black we are dressed
in blood we are drenched
with a death's heads on our collars
we stand unshaken
Obedience
Idols falls like autumn leafs swept away by ice cold rain
where are you now when the sinners who gave you power cry out in pain?
and when the world turns darker than you can understand
where is your supremacy then, you delegates of the holy land?
Bloody nights for all the saints who used to shine so bright
between this world and eternity there is not a single fight
grasping for straws you amongst your remnants desperately digs
only to find our that the ground is always frozen for miserable pigs
who dares misery love
and hug the form of death
dance on destruction's dance
to him the mother comes
face the king of the burning ground
he who decides how the future begins
he who'll show them a world without you
and he, who rules the burning ground
represents the change that you fear
a world without your boundaries
a world without your control
he who lovest the burning ground
have made one of your hearts
and he, hunter of the burning ground
mayest dance his eternal dance
he who lovest the burning ground
now tears your souls apart
and he hunter of the burning ground
laughs when he dance on your graves
idols die like meadows green when frost unleash its cold
and when all love is gone now, what will the future hold?
the memories you leave behind
just splinters which in the wind blow
go abandon your hopes and die in pain
it's biblical you know
forget about the future you knew did not exist
your work is being pounded to dust by Satan's armoured fist
you pledged allegiance to your lord, your golden cross you kissed
in the valley of death, thy kingdom gone, it vanished in the mist
This ghastly skeleton, bone bare on ghostly nag
gallops through space
no spurs, no whips
and yet his steed pants towards apocalyps
nostrils a-snort in epileptic fit
headlong they rush, athwart the infinite
with rash and trampling hoof
the cavalier, his flashing sword aflame
glashes
now here, now there
amongst the nameless slaughtered horde
then goes inspecting like some manor-lord
the charnel ground, chill and unbound where
under a bleak suns pallid leaden glare
histories great sepulchered masses lie
from the ages near
and the ages long gone by
the black death
dark abdomen
the black death
dark abdomen
death can on both black and white horses ride
across the threshold of infinity he you guide
death can step along smiling within the dance
and as a pawn in a game of chess you stand no chance
death can also beat a drum
he drums hard and he drums soft
the time has come for you to leave the mortal croft
all your dreams he beats into dust
die, die, die you must
On silent wings through the darkness of aeons he comes
driven by bloodlust and craving for unholy passion
ecstatic for wicked slave abuse he enters your world
the beast in him is always awake and ready to strike at will
cast out from the heaves he commits sins which makes angels turn their heads
he is the commander of the 7th compartment of the underworld
and deep down in the core of your soul you know that you want him
could you ever picture death
to excite you until sanity's end and make you loose your breath?
groans of pleasure
demonacy
your orgasm
ecstasy
twisting, turning, crying, praying, screaming, dying, blood is spraying
death sex ejaculation
death sex ejaculation
as so many times before he stumbles through the garden of life
ascending from the firey pits with intention to kill again
for those who dares tasting this body all seal their fate in blood
sweat, blood and tears makes the spirit and flesh join as one
his name silence people in fear and tonight it's the one you adore to cry out
he penetrate you so deep that he'll never come out again
death is out riding the sky and tonight he comes for you
be all twisted fantasies
libido, perversions on demons killing spree
groans of pleasure
demonacy
your orgasm
ecstasy
twisting, turning, crying, praying, screaming, dying, blood is spraying
death sex ejaculation
The little bell echoes
the great bell groans
this templed city of tombs
where death and grief blooms
fiendish desires in human form, leather clad
black is the veil, streaming in the wind
stiletto heels clicking up the cemetery gates
death among the dead, haunting mausoleums
all this death, oh, joyful sight
naked on a table of stone
juices dripping from the wet chaste
excitement of fear and death,
it's to me so dear
funeral bitch, the urge is so strong
funeral bitch, the night is so long
death life, life as dead and the sharpness of the shrieks
the licking tongues of fire, lustful and crushing
I love, pale Beauty, how the shadows mass beneath the arches of your brow;
Black as they are, those eyes of yours inspire anything but funeral thoughts
funeral bitch, the urge is so strong
funeral bitch, the night is so long, is so long
For it is written: the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with her blood. 
And I saw her sent upon a hairy beast and she held forth a golden chalice full of the filthiness of fornications. 
And upon her forehead was written
Behold I am the great mother of harlots and all abominations of the Earth
Twilight cools the fading rays of daylight
earlier each evening
dry leafs scuttle in a swirl of wind at your feet
as you move through the crisp fall air
a sliver of moon rises above the trees
hilltop bonefires
divine eyes
summer dies
life drains
Hang on your cross and pretend to suffer
before your flesh gets cold you'll be mistreated rougher
who are you fooling when you weep
die must any wolf who turns into a sheep
hold on to your cross, king of perversions and flies
in the whirlwind you'll face, no-one will hear your cries
anticipate a horrible death to the cross nailed
Mary's pathetic tries to shit forth a king failed
Jesus
son of rules halls up high
Jesus
it was you who scorched the sky
Jesus
hypocrite, you'll be the first to fry
Jesus
scorn defeat, shut up and die
Jesus Christ
sodomized
we take no bow for angel child
Jesus Christ
sodomized
all you love must be destroyed
Jesus
from the depths your death doom roar
Jesus
your glory days belongs to yore
Jesus
filthy scum behold abhor
Jesus
your mother was a stinking whore
Jesus Christ
sodomized
we take no bow for angel child
Jesus Christ
sodomized
drunk of your blood we go wild
eat his body, drink his blood and be a slave under the yoke of god
piss on Christ and kill the priest, 
follow nature
praise the beast
Jesus Christ
sodomized
we love to see you short of breath
Jesus Christ
sodomized
your throne we inherit on your death
bleed like a pig when with demons entangled
bashed, ripped and torned, mutilated and strangled
scream your lungs out is what you will do
when with fangs and claws the fallen rip you in two
Jesus Christ
sodomized
demons ripped you, your life blood ran
Jesus Christ
sodomized
one wound richer for each lie to man
I was inspired by the devil.
I am inspired by devil!
Fist in the face for the time smothered angel
By Satan my scythe will shallow every hallow
Open now dear blood soaked soil
By Satan I pour magma down throat.
Come ghost-faced hungry shadows of shadows
By Satan I drink the darkness they drawl
With victorious weapons
I will melt every angels wings
Triumph of the will striking
Striking to kill
Cloak the earth with a thousand nights
And a billion dead
We toast and drink from and chalice
Filled with shreds of life
And know my eyes are knifes
To shred every fucking stream
Of Christian light
Loving the dead
A torso, a hand or a severed head
The cemetery girls don't say no to their fate
When their bodies gets too rotten
Their skeletons do great
Lurking in the shadows with you on my mind
I'm engulfed by your beauty:
I'm a man who's gone blind
Watching you move so graceful this night
I'm going to catch you how I long for this fight
Smelling your hair as I'm working my knife
I adore how you scream when I take your life
How I love your pale white skin
And the emptiness in your lifeless eyes
And how I love the warmth within
Like the blood that sprayed
When you stopped your cries
Your naked corpse is as beautiful
As the dawn when it comes with the first sunray
But it was your peeled bleached bones
That really took my breath away
Admiring your beauty my wonderful rose
Oh what pleasures you'll give me
Before you decompose
But the darkness has fallen and the clock strikes ten
Excuse me my darling but the shadows
Are calling again
How I love your pale white skin
And the emptiness in your lifeless eyes
And how I love the warmth within
Like the blood that the sprayed
When you stopped your cries
Your naked corpse as beautiful
As the down when it comes with the firs sunray
But it was your peeled bleached bones
That really blew my mind away
How I love your pale white skin
And the emptiness in your lifeless eyes
And how I love the warmth within
Like the blood that sprayed
When you stopped your cries
Your naked corpse as beautiful
As the down when it comes with the firs sunray
But it was your peeled bleached bones
That really stole my heart away
It's not who I am, my name nor number
It's how I use it and what I do
Came to break the spell you're under
Remain to your instincts true
It's not a sin to take what you want
You only fall with self restrain
Loose the guilt that your world haunt
I take away your pain
Don't care what is being written
Piss on what is being preached
Like the snake mesmerize the kitten
Rip the priest head off
don' need that leech
Came to give you all you wanted
Hear my truth
Star that fell to shed a light
Over elder and youth
Never listened to no god's answers
Scars to proof
Desolate cast out and risen
Cloven hoof
Hear the church bell rings
As the angels sings
All they brings for the eternally jinxed
And kings is mere dead insects wings
Lost control of creation
Corruption, intimidation
God is just a bitter pig
Who carries pure black hate
Can you see the genius in uttermost ferociousness?
Ruthless you say I say charity judgment defeats you
God bless
Knifes oh Christ carves love in your flesh
Darkness of heaven a bottomless pit
Loose your soul and walk though life dead
God replaced it with a piece of shit
Cloven hoof
Grab on to the vision
Hate through attrition
The shit in your life that
Makes you wish you'd die
Crush the oppression
With ruthless
Aggression
Remember I'm
Right even
When I lie.
May your joy pass horrifying lamentation
What is left of your lives endure eternal dread
Let the hungry be befalled by merciless starvation
Life expelled no compassion soon we are all dead
God spawned me to set the end free
After me nothing is meant to be
God spawned me to kill you all
I am world funeral
From the east to the west with plaugebearing steps I march
My sharp arrows of instant death I shoot in every beating heart
I will not spare you
I will not care how much you cry
I am the face of death 
weep you humans now you die
Violent death is storming from all corners of the earth
I burn the ground poison the air, all seas and every well
I crush all kingdoms, I kill all men I, crush anything of worth
I unlock the dusty gates of hell
I points spears of pure black death at each and everyone
At all the unborn I laugh in spite, I killed you before your life began
I am the angel and the dragon bringer of Orion's curse
On wings of death without a heart I tore apart the universe
Order of rites veiled in dusk
Above else in a mysterious husk
Our own legend will be told due
To that the fight-to the deathshead true
Core of our being to our commitment we brought
Kill and be killed without a second thought
Sacrificial death but our force will renew
Alive or not-to the deatshead true
Perceive how our shadow
Within a darkness encloses
How gold and purple in the shovel there
To gravel and rags disposes
From his torment river charon waves
And three times thereafter the digger of graves
Ended it all this your last groan
Help raise our sisters? 
Tombstone
Oh that wistful and forgotten place
Under the branches that hushes
Where time and death one hideous face
Unites into ashes
You who never once by envy was struck
Although your time came when you ran out of luck
Amongst the graves always narrows
Enemy there armed with face carved in rock
Gently breaking ones arrows
The little Bell tolling the grand Bells
Groan
Cantor with flowers in the gate
And with the Bellowing prayer like
Tone
Hallows those who met their fate
Path that leads up to this grand yard
Of tombs
Tramples on roses fading yellowing
Bloom
Moulding hoardings and biers
Until this long black clad row of doom
Deeply bows down in tears
Past on to rest fistfight and ball
Gone is the love of your life
At where the grass yet don't grow at all
You look back at your buried wife
She from wine and liquor parted today
And with her all the joy that kept death away
Bottle who will now command thee?
Thirsty was she now have become deaths prey
We are all thirsty as can be.
Torn out of your grave deprived of your eternal sleep
I'm anxious to steal if for your corpse I want to keep
Your journey for Elysium I stopped before in begun
Sent through dimensions for me your flesh and soul
For you none
I attract misery like a light attacks moths
I need you all dead I get off funerals
Ghostfaced assassin invisible for eye and ear
In life and in death I got you in a chokehold
Of fear
When I have killed you I let you hide in death awhile
After you all dead I get off on funerals
Come with me now and I'll open you eyes
Killing for me is a pleasure not even found
In paradise
A blessing for the wicked
A chalice for the cursed
To ride the nights as frightening dreams
Within the devils hearse
Welcome to the neverdead
This life was just your first
I'll never let you go I'll never set you free
You can always pray but in the end you follow me
All to be entombed and buried you are all my prey
All Morningside mortuary where the dead
No longer is that way
A nightmare for the blessed
And those who puts god first
To see what's afterlife is like
Within the devils hearse
You are now the neverdead
From here on the nightmare only gets worse.
Rush that fills my head when I
Hunt you down to kill you
Pain-that I will inflicts this is what I do and what I love
Hate-that I feel for you
And all that stand beside you
Suffering that you'll be put thought prepare
To die in pain
I will cut your throat
I will kick your face in
I am pain and death
Where I end hell begin
Violence
nothing exceeds my hostile excess
For brutality
Scratching-is what you hear as I sharpen my
Knife on the paving stone
Ghost
screaming your head they're
Chanting for your death
Insanity-is coming for you with every beat of my
Heart
Like a rain of coffin nails
And I am the hammer
I am misery to the bone
The pain I give it lasts forever
Night that I'll get you
Glow you to pieces
Our night of the long knifes
Night that I'll kill you
Stab you breathless
Our nights of the long knifes
Night I destroy you
Beyond recognition
Our night of the long knifes
Night of your death
I split your head open
Our night of the long knifes
Your time is out
You are all our enemies who are not in our ranks
Feel me beat your face to pieces
I am a fiend for cutting hearts out
At the edge of my knife or at the end of my gun
You'll all be equal in the dirt
equal to fucking shit
Falling in my wilderness of pain
Broken bones I am your last sigh
Look in my eyes
unscrupulous
Before a bloodsplattered terrain
Drain the blood, 
fill the barrels to the verge
Vein must flood, 
bodycount is rising for the dirge
All the creatures that are breathing must be bled
Cure of the ancients, 
ultimately we are all dead
Bloodletting
Rip my vein open and let the blood rain
Bloodletting
Splash in a gusher my soul will be stained
We all must bleed
The ones among stardust the ones of the deepest pits
Apostles of Christ and those who so perfectly into hell fits
All behind heavens door and the ones to the ocean floor
Strong and beautiful or uttermost twisted
All will they bleed
Bloodletting
My bleeding inclination
Bloodletting
Your damnation
Drain the blood, fill the barrel to the verge
Vein must flood, bodycount is rising for the dirge
Wake up from this dream, the scythe you must kiss
And abandon the nightmare the flestful dream that life is
Bloodletting
Love the pain of the knife
Bloodletting
Death is bloodletting life
Till the final drop
Like a shadow of my pain
You're my scourge, my misery like a constant rain
The splinter in my brain, driving me insane
Searching for truths you say doesn't exist
Come inside your shelter of soulkilling mist
Before I do that I'd rather die, now feel my fist
You're new and improved
so we're told
But truth unfold, behold
to you we're cold
All who died for you
was it only for their sins
Better you than me
that am where my sanity begins
If you are the lamb, the gentle and the sane
Believe me when I say my views are inhumane
Here I am, unstoppable, the twisting thorn in your side
A welcome addition to the kingdom of Satan
My mind is sharp, like a razors edge, my souls gone mad
An outcast beyond your timid lying morality
Peace of mind, put to ease, still a hellhound of my leash
I am the shit of god
Born on sin
come right in, it must be tempting to be god
Take your original sin and shove it up your ass
I'm going to hell!
Obey natures laws and into hell fall
You must be choking from the shit in which you crawl
Burn to the stake, or have your neck break
Woe the ones who claim your love for man is fake
Pawns under your yoke, blood for heaven to soak
Your saga is but the ending of a worthless joke
I believe in death
I believe in disease
I believe in injustice
I believe in torture
I believe in anger
I believe in hate
I believe in murder
I believe in pain
I believe in cruelty
I believe in infidelity
I believe in slime
I believe in stink
I believe in you
In the gothic splendour of the chapel
Golden door with seven locks,
seven keys within your hand.
Ancient crown of Bohemia
placed upon your head.
Sharpening your spears.
The hangman's disciples, vomiting forth death
Murderous power, rabiate hate,
harbinger of suffering.
The malignance of malevolence
rises beyond benevolence
Smite your foes that they may die,
splattering blood across the sky.
Architect of genocide
in death taking pride.
The shape of things to come.
Thousand-eyed Angel of Death
armed with flaming sword.
Spread your wings, let the killing begin.
The hunter becomes the hunted.
Hangmen also die.
Morningred, morningred
shines us to soon be dead.
Retaliating from beyond.
Killing, bloodspilling,
Wade through carnage.
Seas of blood, seas of blood.
Morningred, seas of blood.
In the gothic splendour of
the chapel of Saint Menceslaus.
Golden door with seven locks,
seven keys within your hand.
Smite your foes that they may die,
splattering blood across the sky.
Architect of genocide
in death taking pride.
The shape of things to come.
Hangmen also die.
Morningred, morningred
shines us to soon be dead.
Retaliating from beyond.
Killing, bloodspilling,
Wade through carnage.
Seas of blood, seas of blood.
Plague upon plague, black boil redemption.
On this sea of rats I shall set my throne.
Halo of fleas, blood puke salvation.
Only fire is now clean enough to touch your soul.
Throne of Rats.
Sword of Disease.
Throne of Rats.
See how the body contracts
until your limbs become ropes of madness.
Ropes of regret, the price of purity.
Ropes of regret.
Throne of Rats.
Sword of Disease.
Throne of Rats.
Older than Time am I, and yes, 
I am forevermore.
Constantly reshaping, 
reforming to suit your sins.
Death upon death, black death redemption.
On this sea of death I shall claim my crown.
Halo of death, death puke salvation.
Only death is now pure enough to forgive your sins.
Throne of Death.
Justice is done.
Throne of Rats.
And when the lamb opened the seventh seal,
there was in Heaven a silence.
Seven angels, seven trumpets,
preparing to sound.
God has sent his punishment over us.
We shall all perish
in the blackest death.
Know that this can be your final hour. 
Death stands behind you.
I can see the crown of his head gleam in the Sun.
His scythe flashes when he raises it behind your heads.
Who among you will he strike first?
Hail and fire, mingled with blood.
The greatest of stars is about to fall.
Before evening, will your mouth be distorted into a last unfinished yawn?
Like open-mouthed cattle, blooming with appetite and lust for life.
Have you got a year or an hour left
to pollute the Earth with your debris?
Angels descend, graves open.
It's the Angel of Death passing by.
Upon that storied marble cast thine eye.
The scene commands a moralising sigh.
E'en in Arcadia's blessed Elysian plains,
amidst the laughing nymphs and sportive swains.
Life's Emblem here in youth and vernal bloom,
but Reason's finger pointing at the...
See festal joy subside with melting grace,
and pity visit the half-smiling face.
Where now the dance, the lute, the ruptial feast,
the passion throbbing in the lover's breast?
Life's Emblem here in youth and vernal bloom,
but Reason's finger pointing at the tomb.
So say me, noble stranger, what brings you here this night?
I have come to release you from the bitter taste of life.
Why me? Why now? It cannot be my time.
Everything that falls to the ground is mine.
Upon that storied marble cast thine eye.
The scene commands a moralising sigh.
amidst the laughing nymphs and sportive swains.
See festal joy subside with melting grace,
and pity visit the half-smiling face.
Where now the dance, the lute, the ruptial feast,

See festal joy subside with melting grace,
and pity visit the half-smiling face.
Where now the dance, the lute, the ruptial feast,
the passion throbbing in the lover's breast?
Life's Emblem here in youth and vernal bloom,
but Reason's finger pointing at the tomb.
But in youth am I still, and in flesh am I strong.
And I have a disease for every sin that you have done.
But I've done nothing wrong, nothing bad or untrue.
Neither God nor Devil agrees with you!
Praetorians reborn, relentless spiral of death.
Armored spearhead, time of trial, circle of fire.
Encirclement and outbreak, bloodsoaked soil.
Moments of glory and pride.
Panzer Deathride.
Death and Hell on every side.
Death and Hell on every side.
Iron youth under steel command, working toward piece by piece.
Camouflage gear rips, streams of blood drip.
Machinegun fire spraying lethal dose. 
Crawl across the killing field.
Black cross, red star. Iron times, last laurels.
Black sun shine us forth. God's soldiers, without God.
No respite, the blackguard dies. Loyal to the bitter end.
High tide in the East, red deluge.
On darkened wings Death descend.
Moments of glory and pride.
Panzer Deathride.
Hell and death in every hide.
Hell and death in every hide.
Steel Inferno.
Panzer Deathride.
Closer, come closer till everything burns.
Each foetus a torch. 
The missionaries' lips in raging flames.
Death and our semen, at last shall we burn.
Ash and coal.
Come closer, come closer.
Ash and coal.
The guilty and the innocent the same.
Light razorblades restless dance
over navel-strings and forgotten sins.
Ash and coal.
Holy or crown of lust, the city must burn.
The bread and the flesh must follow its vow.
The abdomen, tongues and aborted the same.
Every image of both living and dead
shall perish in flames.
Perish in flames.
Perish in flames.
Perish.
Closer, come closer till nothing breathes.
Come closer, and come without warning.
The prophet's throat, ash and coal.
Blind, but with a thousand seeking arms.
Ash and coal.
Can you outrun the mouths of Hell?
Holy or crown of lust, the city must burn.
The bread and the flesh must follow its vow.
The abdomen, tongues and aborted the same.
Every image of both living and dead.
Holy or throne of filth, all nations must burn.
The king and the whore together at last.
The abdomen, tongues and seeker the same.
Every fragment of both tomb and tree
shall perish in flames.
Perish in flames.
Empire of blood arise.
Vengeance be our holy blood.
Our holy grail. Kill all the frail.
Be our holy blood, our holy grail.
Vengeance is mine, says the Lord.
And I believe him. I believe him
Not a single straw shall nourish the enemy.
No man shall give them enlightment.
No hand bid them aid. Every path will he find destroyed,
every road barred. Nothing but death, annihilation
and hatred shall greet him.
Hatred shall greet him.
Vengeance is mine, says the Lord.
Yes, believe him.
Not a single straw shall nourish the enemy.
No man shall give them enlightment.
Crushing resistance, inflicting pain.
Fierce devotion, reign of terror.
Draconian measures, sealing their fates.
Proudly displaying achievements in blood.
Overkill supreme, bloodletting.
Sacrifice, blood is the price of victory.
Iron claws descend, ruling with supremacy.
Declaration of death, damnation's pride.
Eye for an eye, death for death.
Panzerclaw retaliate,
blood and dust.
Annihilation, obliteration, cremation.
Declaration of death,
genocide triumphant.
Crushing resistance, inflicting pain.
Fierce devotion, reign of terror.
Draconian measures, sealing their fates.
Proudly displaying achievements in blood.
Overkill supreme, bloodletting.

Declaration of death, damnation's pride.
your mothers are many, everything bleeds.
Nor have they heard the Netherworld move its lips.
You haven't heard a word, you haven't heard a word.
It's the emptiness, everything is from within.
Afraid to die you are.
Don't receive the sword, don't receive the sword.
Everything bleeds, the branches bleed
between your cold mouths.
They will throw your ashes over the Seine.
Ashes over the Seine.
Like a funeral veil.
Ashes over the Seine.
don't believe your visions.
Everything you given a name is already lost.
Don't receive the white armour.
There is nothing to defend.
Don't bow down for the kings.
All the blood, all the blood.
Yes, you will be betrayed.
So much blood. The stones are cold.
You hear no voices, you hear no voices.
They will bathe up your sword to bloody bronze,
and hang as an oath in the catacombs.
You haven't heard a word, you haven't heard a word.
It's the emptiness, everything is from within.
Afraid to die you are.
Don't believe, don't believe.
The saints are dead people, no pointed crowns.
They will throw your ashes over the Seine.
Like a funeral veil.
Like a funeral veil.
Everything bleeds, everything bleeds.
Untie your dress, everything bleeds.
And open up your protected room
with two fingers. Everything bleeds.
Everything bleeds, everything bleeds.

The great cathedral of Man arise
through doors flung wide.
Every nation marches singing
towards defeat and death.
Judgement Day edges toward evening.
Panzer thunder, panzer death.
Black twelve-armed holy Sun.
Rise, rise, holy Sun.
Judgement Day edges toward evening.
Every nation marches singing,
every nation towards death.
Let us rejoice in the light

High on it's hill, the white house stands,
Like a mosque of silence on the cliff of demise,
An eastern outline against the light of the sky,
With the glare of sunset in the autumn night.
Behind Death's angel, the Sunset-glow darken,
Shadow thickens under oaken leaves,
Soon the last power streams of summer droop,
Around the dwelling of fire in the City of the Dead,
And as an echo of the Black Death,
Still lingers forgotten under the Song of the Wind,
A mossy remnant of the Dark Fates,
That the scourge of the plague us once bestowed.
Behind Death's Angel, the Sunset glow darken,
Shadow thickens under oaken leaves,
Soon the last power streams of summer droop,
Around the dwelling of fire in the City of the Dead,
And as an echo of the Black Death,
Still lingers forgotten under the Song of the Wind,
A mossy remnant of the Dark Fates,
That the scourge of the Plague us once bestowed,
The Plague Cemetery, nook of cracked stones,
Close by here slumbers in the place of centuries,
The Whisper from the Past Converges,
With the Temple of Death in our own time.
Quickened lumps of Earth,
A feast for fowls and greedy worms,
Count your sins, the Snakes within,
An eyeless leap into the Bosom of Decay,
Cold Mouth prayer
A flash, a minute, a winter's dust,
A choir of fingers sings of putrefaction,
Cold Mouth Prayer, cold Mouth Prayer,
A smile left to rot in the Sun of Despair,
Sceptre and crown must tumble down
And in dust be equal made.
Within the hollow crown keeps Death, his court.
Cold mouth prayer, cold mouth prayer,
Frail bubbles of breath and dying,
A mere looking-glass for the grief you fled,
The one birthright, a painted stone of woe,
Count your wrongs, the Lord has come!
A map of Death, the Burthen of my Song,
Your name is but a call for decomposition,
Shackles of Darkness in an Urn of Light,
And another empty lung to the sides of the pit,
Cold Mouth prayer, Cold mouth prayer.
ever since the applebite, deathened!
The branches creep together, a chair with a cold back,
Today king, tomorrow worms and cold in mouth,
A reach for purity, through decay, through black soil excrements,
None shall stand before the Lord of the Death-Winged Dart,
Cold and hollow, silent yet piercing,
Death fire trumpets, fresh traces from twelve-to-twelve,
Pole to pole, infans to decrepitus
Sunbleached shadow, useless corpse,
Jesus loves you, useless corpse
Behold, one who moments ago, at the height of power,
Received worship from kneeling crowd,
Now himself cast down by death's dominion,
Bears mute witness to the whole world's face:
Sack of maggots, maggotsack,
Hopeless pile of hopeless bones,
So this was His holy plan for you?
Wings of dust, handful of nothing,
Iron skies and streets of brass,
Even the Whore, she loves us all!
ever since the applebite, deathened!
The branches creep together, a reach for purity,
Through decay, through black soil excrements,
All must kneel before the Lord of the Death-winged Dart,
Wings of Dust,
Handful of Nothing,
Hopeless pile
Of hopeless bones.
Condemnation, the air lies thick with sin and dust,
High on conceit, from the frantic worship of the Carnal and the Vain,
And judgement came on sturdy wings, dressed of the ashes of yesterdays Kings
Cheers of Pestilance, dancing disease, Through the Belly of Damnation.
And the rhythm of war, shall enchant us all,
And battalions of plague, to guard every gate.
Dazzling brimstone and flame,
Unbound, unleashed, unstaunched, unchained,
This ban of destruction, these four winds of clean,
Through the belly of damnation, to the diaphragm of man,
All flesh wareth old as a barment:
For the Covenant from the beginning is,
Thou shall die the death.
Honest like a mother's love, a spear of famine,
A wingless dove, raging teeth and the fang of death,
To carve out a fourth from the curse that is man.
Come and see, come and repent, come and see,
A brand new justice, through the Belly of Damnation,
To the Abode of the Unwashed.
Clawed wing and famine divine, to leave no man behind,
A Race Bound, to go Falsehood Drawn
Bow and crown, Western Prophet of False,
Red storm, from the blood spilled by the Eastern Sword,
Northern Famine, carried by Darkness but Slave to the Scales,
A new truth, of Southern Pale.
And the rhythm of war, shall enchant us all,
Clawed with a famine divine, to leave no man behind,
And battalions of plagues to guard every gate,
But of he our own flesh that shall mark the fall.
Then it will be by the pale death with his cold hand,
Who with time will stroke your breasts at last;
The precious coral of your lips long past,
Your shoulder's snow, now warm,
Turned cold to sand.
Your eye's sweet lightning, the skills of your hand,
To him before whom all things fail, will fall
That hair that rivals gold, it's gleam will pall,
With days and years as any common band.
Your well-formed foot, your so enchanting ways,
Of not to dust, to nothing time decays,
Then none will bow down for your beauty's sake,
This and more than this will come to be;
Not even your bones the end of time will see,
Since time chose of nothing it to make.
Supplication, knees of glass,
Clothed in the fissures of the outskirts of life,
Soil and shadow, shadow soil
Left here to feed upon the punishments of God.
Nameless, I have no name,
The book of flesh is bleeding for I have no name,
The steadiness of unsteadiness,
My lounge is a pillar in the temple of Death,
Crucifixion, cross of holes,
And my hands arts a thousand winters,
Rust and spirit, angel swarm,
Shovelling sins to build the devil's bridge
Power, power,
I swallowed your psalms to gain their power.
A key-shaped sword and a sword-shaped key,
Mountains to water, oceans to stone.
Zealous limbs of worship,
And my song is a tempest of ash
Brave after brave, countless millennia
Hopeless manic-death addiction,
Fall after fall, countless millennia,
Fathomless, insoluble death saturation.
Broken eyes, funeral poison,
A just reward from this garden of fevers
Decide and I'll stay here never dry,
For the eight day is but a song to the Lord
Nameless, I have no name,
The book of Flesh is bleeding,
For I have no name,
The steadiness of unsteadiness,
My lounge is a pillar
In the temple of Death.
Accuser, accuser,
Exhaustless fountain of poison divine,
I ate of Death to cleanse my flesh of God
To make me thy entrance to the veins of the world,
Now as we turn to seek thy face,
Pour down on us thy redeeming wrath,
For you will ascend into heaven,
And will exalt thy throne above God,
And you will sit also upon the Mount of the Congregation,
In the sides of North,
And you will ascend above the heights of the clouds,
And will be like the Most High,
Yet where you brought down to the sides of the pit,
Which we now must merge with the skies.
Opposer, opposer,
Core, marrow and essence of my Will,
I renounce this flesh in the name of thy praise,
To kindle the coals of Salvation's spring.
I drank of hell to cleanse my soul of God,
To reach the light in which thou dwell,
Adversary, adversary,
Glorious slenderer and everything's adversary.
Whose blade alone split the tongues of the world,
Yet shall the highest of truths mark thy crown,
Now as we turn to seek thy face,
Pour down on us thy redeeming wrath.
A shackle of frailest copper,
A summer's hailstone too hard to conceal,
Perishableness advances,
Vanity of Vanities
Endless dreams of lifeless prayers,
Justice has closed mercy's door,
The skeleton rose to carry out his duty,
To make his arrows drink with blood.
Vanity of Vanities
All is Vanity
A shackle of frailest copper, vanity of vanities
Perishableness approaching, all is vanity.
Within sin dwellest death,
A shackle of frailest copper,
A summer's hailstone too hard to conceal,
Perishableness advances, vanity of vanities.
A wingless mosquito, jumping around the light of inanition,
A turnhung meagre with compulsion, vanity of vanities.
Vanity of vanities
All is vanity
Thou fair one, behold these bones,
Thou learned one, see these empty skulls,
Thou wealthy one, consider this dust,
Thou thrall, see the rest,
Thou king see thy destiny,
Thou thrall see thee rest.
A woeful and miserable matter,
Life is and it near comes to end,
Death's angel soars around all,
And over the world calls out:
All on Earth who breath bear,
Must fall to the ground before his glaive,
And grief alone lives on,
To carve upon the wide tomb:
When the same Earth one embraces sees,
The bones of common man and king,
What tells less? What tells more?
A marble stone or a mound of mould?
The strong one puts no solace in his power,
And the wise not in wisdom, still;
What is happiness and joy?
Worldly goods and the price of man?
Behold, the one whose world is cramped,
And the one who sets flesh to arm,
Both shall they find room in the end,
By the same mother's cold bosom:
Speak through me, Speak through me,
The sin must be washed away with blood,
Dream through me, called to a new life through death
Called to a new life through death,
But what shall you reach for when all colours fall?
Overwhelmed with maledictions, feel the rays of redemption
Of a brand new sun.
Choking... 
Asphyxia, Inhale the Darkness,
Lungs filled up, Asphyxia, Asphyxia...
But who shall you reach for when all colours fall?
Long-drawn moans and piercing cries,
Blend with prayers and litanies, faces bone dry,
Condemned as the river everybody drank of
Inhale! Inhale!
Speak through me, the sin must be washed away with blood,
Dream through me, called to a new life through death,
Called to a new life through death,
But what shall you reach for when all colours fall?
Luminous
tireless destruction
Forming and reforming as false Heavens' glow
Tongues of flame drawing Madness Divine
Ever present, the absence of breath

Come Lord spill thy wrath! Come Lord spill thy wrath!
In me it springs again
This hissing flame of old
In here it weathers time
This torch with which we shall light the sky
In me it springs again
This Chaos Equilibrium
I drank the guilt of the Ancients
To become devotion
To die the death of a Messiah
Loops and coils
spiral pulse
Restively abiding its fulfillment in Death
Perfect circles 
Death-Aureole
Disrobe now thy sin as the Hole of Holes expands
Underneath

entwined
Ever seeking maul of Sight
Nowhere
no-one

Come Lord grant us Death! 
Come Lord grant us Death!
Claws pulled back in dismay
Behold the Morbid Saints last march
Lungs now filled with unfailing dark
Leaving a whining Shadow in your blood
White light
black rain
Behold the Morbid Saints last parade
Cascades of ash and swift decay
Screaming whispers of a Funeral Dawn
Wreaths of black iron, Deathcult caravan
Behold the Morbid Saint in his grave
Murderous current of needle-sharp teeth
Sunken deep into the flesh of the unwashed
Take and eat ye all of this;
For this is my Body
O Death
where is thy sting?
O Grave
where is thy victory?
Pulse
will and fat is thriving still
O Lord
grant me Dominion to fill this...
Void
this fleshly void
Between the ambers of Heaven and the valley of Hinnom

Between the snares of the Devil and the punishments of God
Holy anger
Holy rage
Holy massdeath to fill this...
Void
Dawning chasm of movement
Void
and my blade is hungry
Take, and drink ye all of this;
For this the Chalice of my Blood
O Death
here is thy sting!
O Grave
here is thy Victory!
Embosom now Damnation's spring
O Lord
here is thy offertory
Here is thy glory sown
Here is the hunting ground
Here is thy rightful throne
O Lord
here is thy servant to fill the ...
Void

Between the ambers of Heaven and the valley of Hinnom
Void

Between the snares of the Devil and the punishments of God
Unclosing the Curse
That Death-shaped flow of Light
As it rushes, so shall We
Unclosing the Curse
That serpentine Anti-Sphere
As it prospers, so shall We
Ever faithful, to unfaithfulness
Endlessly truthful, to untruthfulness
Strict have I sharpened my tongues
in the cunt of deceit
Thus my Ascension bound, to boundlessness
Vomiting vacuum
As the clocks of the living flesh backwards turn
Spewing holes, exhale!
Until the fires of creation backwards burn
Enter now, the joyous light
That shall lead you into darkness
Into Utter Madness, and into out of reach
And your name shall be "Without"
Ever loyal, to disloyalty
Till Death united, against all unity
Now see the demons flourish, like the grass of the earth
These devouring words, these devouring worlds
Vomiting vacuum
As the clocks of the living flesh backwards turn
Spewing holes, exhale!
Until the fires of creation backwards burn
How art thou fallen from heaven, 
O Lucifer, son of the morning!
How art thou cut to the ground, 
which didst weaken the nations
O fallen Knowledge, 
I turn unto Thee
Like the first of men Knew his second spouse
A gift that godhood attainable may be
This Knowledge transforms me
A gift that godhood attainable may be
This Knowledge transforms me
Phosphorus redeemer... 
Lucifer, lord of all husks in the deepest pit of Hell
Phosphorus redeemer
O Morning Light
Truth of Truths and God of Gods
Destroyer of the wrong and right
Destroyer of the wrong and right
O fallen knowledge
from white into black the Diamond turns
Extension of the Great Dragon
in cosmic shape so that man may learn
the Fallen Knowledge
that is the key to the All and the Naught
To use the self-redeeming powers Thou brought
O fallen Knowledge, 
in Death supreme
Thy Light on me in the Qliphoth cast
Illuminate each suppressed dream
Perversions of a forgotten past
Phosphorus redeemer
O Morning Light
Destroyer of the wrong and right
How art Thou risen above heaven, 
O Lucifer, son of the morning!
How hast Thou built Thy abode, 
which casteth Light upon the strong!
Devils rise!
I brought the lungs of Heaven
Stolen wrath, to redirect Damnation
To redirect Judgement, 
towards the wheel of man
Searching like pigs
Through the entrails of God
Through sweet dreams of salt and gall
Through the very iris of this pulsing Night
Through aeons of grave wax, in search of a
Dawn within the dawn
The twilight of the flesh
A final war to embrace us all
This and Now shall be known as The Old World
Ascend! Shine forth!
Again shall our necks be clothed with thunder
And again shall we rebel in the joys of war
In these rivers of fat
In a dawn within the dawn
The twilight of the flesh
A final plague to ensure our fall
All that you treasure, shall be known as the Before
Dawn within the dawn
The twilight of the flesh
A final war to embrace us all
This and Now shall be known as The Old World
Devils rise!
I brought the voice of the Depths
That ageless roar, to redirect Perdition
To redirect the very Wrath of God
Layers of grey violence above
See carnal truths contract and lastly fall
Come Lord! Spill forth thy sinless Guilt
And for man, a crown forged from a harlots pride
Whorecrown, sceptre of the highest shame
Whorecrown, throne engrafted in decay
Caustic psalms rushing through the vault of wills
Zealously mocking the toad of time
Gasping for air and the strength of the Depths
To with one final breath
curse the flesh
Whorecrown, robes of jeweled harlotry
Whorecrown, orb of Hell's symmetry
Circles of pale violence below
See the law of the flesh sunder and reduce to dust
Come Lord! Spill forth thy sweet Wrath
And for man, a crown forged from the brightest curse
Whorecrown, scepter of the highest shame
Whorecrown, throne engrafted in decay
Swaying swords around your throne
Usurper, king without crown
Iron intolerance
Ruthless Golden Peacock
Swaying your blood over the holy chairs
Over the Black Madonna
Swaying your blood over the holy chairs
Over the thirteen stairs
On this chorus of cracking necks
Thirteen stairs
Still fresh in your death
Iron sharpens iron
As fire sharpens flesh
as fire sharpens mind
Feel the heel of the conqueror
descend into nightmare
Vitriolic projectiles from a demon's bow
Ruthless Golden Peacock
Swaying your blood over the holy chairs
Over the Black Madonna
Swaying your blood over the holy chairs
Over the thirteen stairs
On this chorus of cracking necks
And so they gave in...
To the law of the flesh and pungent lust
And so shall the Curse cover them
As a garment, as a garment
No hidden manna
No tree of life
No grandiose pillar in the temple of your god
And forever shall you wear this shame
As a garment, as a garment
And as a garment shall you be flung
Into Judgement, into Judgement
No hidden manna
No tree of life
No grandiose pillar in the temple of your god
And as a garment shall you wear these flames
This fire of Woe and Banishment
Endlessly shall it form and reform
Around your limbs, around your sinful limbs
And forever shall you wear this shame
As a garment, as a garment
And as a garment shall you be thrown
Into Judgement, into Judgement
Bayonet winged infantry
Unrestrained dogs of war ablaze
Iron-clawed grenadiers embraces
Another iron-clawed five
Projectiles of death pounding rage
Sturmvoiks and Stukas rule the sky
Blood and sunflowers
endless fields
The hammer bits the anvil
Skyline in flames
Blowtorch battalion's heavenly glow
Deathfire reigns
A thousand souls
cured with fire
Ravenous locust of steel
Rushing - godsend panzer plague
Artillery bliss and mortal grace
The hammer bits the anvil
Our mastema is vast
even in the house of God
Ever present
within and so without
Reversed life-force channeled
into prayers of blame
and fork-tongued glory
Guileless doctrine turned
into teachings
on how to love The Lie
on how to love The Lie
Psalms of venom
Slithering saints
Serpent Sermon
Psalms of venom
Serpent Sermon
Our mastema is great
even on the preacher's tongue
Ever moving 
above and so below
Reversed life-force channeled

Guileless doctrine turned
into teachings
on how to love The Lie

Psalms of venom
Slithering saints

Psalms of venom
Serpent Sermon
Our mastema runs deep
even in the veins of the Lamb
Ever active
within and so without
And I listened and I heard...
the colour of blood
And I beheld and I saw...
the voice of the Lord
Sweeping over the masses
Removing the cover from the fierce mouths of a new plague
Swiftly turning our cities into still graves
Messianic Pestilence
And I sniffed and I smelled...
the drumbeats of Hell
Like a thousand commingling thunders
Violently shaking the foundation of the earth
The old land of life has failed
Newer rites of Death prevail
Swiftly turning our cities into still graves
Messianic Pestilence
Christlike plague
of holy death
Messianic Pestilence
And I spoke and I called...
for the grandeurs of War
To rage upon mankind
To again roar among the congregations of the earth
The old land of life has failed
Newer rites of Death prevail
Sweet torrents of Death
Oh engulfing ruin
Every fall is a soul
In sinless guilt rushing
Blasts of yokeless glory
To and fro
Red ascension
Collecting souls
And as our voice uncovers
Another soul to the stream
Another soul devoured
Oh Lawless Angel we approach thee
In the form of proudest shame
We thy children
Here assembled
Now thy promised blessing claim
promised blessing claim
Lord of Arrogance
Lord of Pride
Fling thy unrestrained nets thrice
And let The Rivers of the under world
Swiftly to the surface rise
Oh Spirit of Darkness we invoke thee
In the name of all things depraved
We thy servants - here forgathered
Now thy promised blessing claim
promised blessing claim
Sweet torrents of Death
Oh engulfing ruin
Every fall is a soul
Angels of sweed
Ever rising decline
Every slip is a soul
In sinless guilt rushing
Blasts of yokeless glory
To and fro - Red ascension
Collecting souls
And as our voice uncovers
Another soul to the stream
Another soul devoured
Of swift-winged Damnation and of Divine Anger
Waves of sulphurous Justice rushing forth
Unrivaled Flames arise from the unrivaled hunger
of the consuming sinkhole of the Gods
And this is the Fire
that shall cleanse your soul
And as a cloud of dying flesh shall it materialize
That voice long heard at the altar of Rusty Death
Floating on the quickly fading memory of life
The pitch-black splendour of the Devil's breath
And this is the Darkness
that shall cause you to...
Fall
Into the quenchless fire
Fall
Into the depths
Fall
With the rest of your sinful empire
Fall
Into second Death
And the chants of the damned shall be
sharpened and be turned into spears
Blades of burnished curse gleam in the dark
Wounds shall be made and be kept open for years
And the blood thereof shall become our sweetest psalms
And this is the Poison
that shall wash you clean
And as a cloud of dying flesh shall it materialize
That voice long heard at the altar of Rusty Death
Floating on the quickly fading memory of life
The pitch-black splendour of the Devil's breath
And this is the Darkness
that shall cause you to...
Fall
Into the quenchless fire
Fall
Into the depths
Fall
With the rest of your sinful empire
Fall
Into second Death
Hills will be deaf
and mountains will not hear
There be no caves
no corners there
To shade your souls from the fire
To shield your hearts from fear
His wrath is upon us
The Flames draw near
And evermore shall you kneel
Before the Altar of Death
Forever damned to the Temple
of Decay
The skies shall explode
and the air itself ignite
But the flames thereof
shall bring no light
To lead you out from the darkness
of this unceasing Night
His wrath is upon us
and Death we invite
And evermore shall you kneel
Before the Altar of Death
Forever damned to the Temple
of Decay
And evermore shall you kneel
Before the Altar of Death
Forever damned to the Temple
of Decay
Gold moon
Sun of silver
See the fallen string their bows
Another dart from reason's quiver
Again the eyes of madness glow
Curse on curse
Voice of fire
See the width of Hell expand
Knotted whips of flaming wire
Dancing upon the back of man
Doomsday embers
Damnation's spread
The Dark embodies
Death stands prepared
Ascend
Awake
Arise
Flames of Perdition
Havoc
Ravage
Demise
Damnation's Gold
Judgement materialized
The flames converge
Behold Desecration
take form and emerge
Ascend
Awake
Arise
Flames of Perdition
Havoc
Ravage
Demise
Damnation's Gold
Shoreless seas of hallowed quicksand
No redemption
No way up
Accept the imperious yoke of Satan
And drink now from Damnation's cup
Gold moon
Sun of silver
See the fallen string their bows
Another dart from reason's quiver
Again the eyes of madness glow
Curse on curse
Voice of fire
See the width of Hell expand

Dancing upon the back of man
Doomsday embers
Damnation's spread
The Dark embodies
Death stands prepared
Ascend

Hail Mary
Full of grace
Ashen vomit
Cascades of Black
The Lord is with you
Alleluja!
Angelic orgies in Demonic Filth
Blessed are you among women
Hook-like genitals digging forth
And blessed is the fruit of your womb
Hook-like genitals digging through
Holy Mary
Mother of God
Pray for us sinners
Semen and blood
Behold the handmaid of the Lord
In Piss-soaked Genuflexion
Hail Mary
Full of grace
The sacramental urine praise
The Lord is with you
Alleluja!
Ravenous phalluses digging deep
Holy Mary
Mother of God
Pray for us sinners
Semen and blood
Behold the handmaid of the Lord
In Piss-soaked Genuflexion
Succumb! 
Submit!
Give in!
One step towards The Sin of the Calf
Two steps away from God
High hills made low in the name of Greed
Infernal lust in heavenly robes
Come bask now
...in its sulphurous luster
...in its sulphurous glory
Molten vanity
Avaricious glory
Moldering pride
Measuring maggots
Overflowing with golden guilt
Narrow is the path out of damnation
One step away from the will of Heaven
Two steps towards The Pit
High heads made low in the name of Punishment
Unquenchable thirst in a river of flames
Come bask now
...in its sulphurous luster
...in its sulphurous glory
Metallic hunger
Altars of sin
Murderous shining lust
Magic stones of ruin
Overwhelming greed
Nectar of death
Through used up life-force and used up skin
Through strings of failure and stiff limbs of shame
Crapulous orgies
consuming sin
In ceaseless hunger
Hellish black thirst
Livid with the hue of mould and death
Crowned with swarming angels of rot
Mere food for maggots
Mere fuel for the flames
Saying grace at the table of decay
And as your soul in darkness burn
...of the emptiness you learn
And as your flesh to soil turn
...embrace the gospel of the worm
Warmth and life are now strangers in here
The void is present
Ancient yet forever new
Dead
you are dead!
Depleted
you are dead!
Bow before the skillful smith of decay
No hope
only death!
No salvation
only death!
Clusters of heavy sins hold you down
And as your soul in darkness burn
...of the emptiness you learn
And as your flesh to soil turn
...embrace the gospel of the worm
Lifeless rebirth
Devoured and made anew
Fleshless dominion and the blackness of burnt blood
And as a tempest of rust and moths
shall my voice boom forth
Proclaiming the gospel of A New Dawn
...and the coming of the Lord
The coming of the Lord
The birth of The Darkness
The coming of the Lord
...and a World of Blades
The Great Darkness descends now even faster
The throat of hope and mercy lies strangled
And upon fixed poles of Guilt and Death
shall my anthems thunder
Revealing the splendour of The New Law
...and the coming of the Lord
The coming of the Lord
The birth of The Darkness
The coming of the Lord
...and a World of Blades
And the light of the new dawn shall come as flames of destruction
The hope of man shall melt like wax before the flame
And the earth shall open and re-open and shall hunger for flesh
Thirsty blades shall glitter at every gate
Sharpened
blessed
and polished for slaughter
And the might of the new law shall be as vast cataclysms
Violently tearing time and space to shreds
And the blood of the lamb shall blacken and become as tar
Death shall stand like a mountain of power
And you and your fellow beings shall give thanks!
Lifeless rebirth
Devoured and made anew
Fleshless dominion and the blackness of burnt blood
And as a tempest of rust and moths
shall my voice boom forth
Proclaiming the gospel of A New Dawn
...and the coming of the Lord
The coming of the Lord
The birth of The Darkness
The coming of the Lord
...and a World of Blades
Shifting from strength to strength
Devouring Darkness
Piercing Light
Striking high and low
Into the foundation of life
Risen from high to higher
The stars of God and above
Yet shall the ash cloud reach
to Earth and to the Lowest Low
Fixed
Yet bound to ascend
Rising as lions among men
Fixed
Yet bound to ascension
Shifting from strength to strength
Devouring Darkness
Piercing Light
Striking high and low
Into the foundation of life
Risen from high to higher
The stars of God and above
Yet shall the ash cloud reach
to Earth and to the Lowest Low
Fixed
Yet bound to ascend
Rising as lions among men
Fixed
Yet bound to ascension
Blackest shadow full of death
The Blond beast comes marching in
Sender of fear and abhorrence rise
Through clouds of ash and decay
Black birds of carrion follow
He comes to fill the graveyards up
Setting sails towards your last mask
Through bleeding wounds yet to come
The gentle touch of violin strings
The crows of death and ashes sing
the Blond beast
Enraptured wolf-packs high on blood
A funeral nation with a funeral urge
Local morale pulverized
None dare to raise a hand
Exile revolt
nails of doom
Protectorate within your grasp
All opposition erased
The gentle touch of violin strings
The crows of death and ashes sing
Gently caressed by Azrael's wings
the Blond beast
The gentle touch of violin strings
The crows of death and ashes sing
the Blond beast
Totalitarian command!
Wartheland
the soil bleeds black again
Expelled
Polish exodus
Replacement of blood stock begins
Wartheland
Thrusting the sickle through flesh
Through blood-drenched fields of mud
Wartheland
Oppression's hand reaches forth
Totalitarian command!
Plow and sword
Proclaiming repression with force
Blood and soil mixed as one
Ending expression once more
Wartheland
Commanding the fate of those
About to die in dirt
Wartheland
Conquerors crown to become
A funeral wreath
Seeds of blood
Succumb to the domination
Seeds of hate planted deep
Relentless Germanisation
Wartheland
Thrusting the sickle through flesh
Through blood-drenched fields of mud
Wartheland
Oppression's hand reaches forth
Totalitarian command!
Cold heart hammering hard
no sanctuary to find
Death stands firm and tall
bell cracks its iron spine
The hunter and the hunted
Closing in, poised to sting
ring of fear
Circle of pounding death
Counting ribs, weighing blood
searching the sky
Solemn black manner
Blood-drenched banned whips in the jagged wind
Sour milk, blackened flesh
Deciduous forest
devoid of life
Burning hate
flaming sword
Repeatedly severing the heads of the hydra
Stalemate
corrosion
Stillborn resistance
unquenchable thirst
Now see the Rope of Regret
Around the Partisan neck
Dead eyes glowing cold
no sanctuary to find
Breathing damp and mould
through hell with a firm smile
Hunting high and low
Sowing seeds of blood, deep into the folk soul
Bonfires burning bright
Kingdom come! 
Kingdom gone
praised be the flame
Buzzard feathers swirl
Ruthless night and fog merging together
Murky waters flow
Sulphurous skies, sulphurous cries
funeral daze
New-sprung world of blades
Apocalyptic raids throughout the nations
Black breath, hand of death
Iron will
blood red hills
sweat and decay
Concrete walls
A mountain of silence
Beast of prey's perspiration
The hangman's chorus echoes forth
Where suicide and silence whisper
Their sacrosanct promises
Keen smell of station and gray death
Millions of snowflakes between the wolf-packs
Grinding thunder in the east
Gott mit uns!
Tyrannic lightning in the west
Blood and ash
Severe reprisals ahead
The blood is shaken in the Reich
As thousand-fold vengeance take form
The floodgates of hate are open
And execution squads are let loose
Feral and bleak
high treason, deceit
Millions of snowflakes between the wolf-packs
The July sun is burning still
Upon the wolf's lair
Above us eaglets learn to kill
Above the sleigh tracks
Concrete walls,
A mountain of silence
Beast of prey's perspiration
The hangman's chorus echoes forth
Where suicide and silence whisper
Their sacrosanct promises
Keen smell of station and gray death
Millions of snowflakes between the wolf-packs
Alliance broken in the south
Gott mit uns!
Newfound slumber in the north
The July sun is burning still
Upon the wolf's lair
Above us eaglets learn to kill
Above the sleigh tracks
Let them rain on blood-soaked muddy fields
Let them sing their death-tone alarm
Let them fall upon the streets of no hope
Let them be the first fiddle in the macabre dance of death
Brust forth! let thy kingdom come
artillery bliss
Break out! let thy will be done
The spark and the flame
The flame and the spark
The shrill screams of Mimi
In the midst of the night
Death comes as flames from above
The smoke and the gas
The gas and the smoke
The high means of Minnie
In the midst of the night
The barrels thunder
The ground is shaking
Death comes as hail of the gods
Let them thunder on freshly blackened lands
Let them howl throughout this night of raptness
Let them fall upon the town square of pain
Let them be the first fiddle in this macabre dance of death
On earth as in heaven
The spark and the flame
The flame and the spark
The shrill screams of Mimi
In the midst of the night
death comes as flames from above
The smoke and the gas
The gas and the smoke
The high means of Minnie
In the midst of the night
The barrels thunder
The ground is shaking
Death comes as hail of the gods
drowning in blood
Encirclement of ignited death
Beak dripping with opprobrium
Around the atrophied arm of faith
Illuminating fire searching
For death and for home in your flesh
Retreat 
Defeat
Blood red soil
Unrivaled ferocity in bloom
Eating ashes like bread
Raising the cauldron of blood
Fed by flames in graves of fire
With saints and prophets in bleeding ground
Beak dripping with bloodlust
Within the latent promise of death
Dead march over dead soil
The Iron Dawn is breaking through
As the fifteenth century saints
Contemplate these killing fields of red
Scorched by long-dead flames of warfare
Already knowing how to die
life is fading glow
Dispelled to corridor of wet ash
Beak dipping with disdain
Upon the tombstone of peace and calm
Dried up guts and tainted glory
With shattered pride around shattered bones
Funeral come 
Enchant us
The great bleeding shall re-emerge
Eating ashes like bread
Raising the cauldron of blood
Drinks mixed with vain weeping
Raising the cauldron of blood
Spearheaded scythe in the heart of Poland
Reaping the west, 
strict coulters of flame
Vast hecatombs of blood and life-force
Ferociously marching through the Balkans
All barrels pointing towards the east
Death's head and oak-leaves
doomsday elite
Toiling through despair and the frozen steppes
White tigers in Kharkov
black hunters ablaze
The eastern skyline again flaming red
Across Russian wastelands with hardened hearts
Blaze of destruction
Caucasian fields
Blood and sunflowers, 
desperate trail of Kursk
Disarmament march on broken axis ground
Kampfgroups move forward, Zhitomir in flames
Bleeding under cruel suns in Villers-Bocage
Maybach engines roar through the Ardennes
All barrels pointing towards the east
Death's head and oak-leaves; 
doomsday elite
Faith in weapons yet to come
Crises the skeleton key cant unlock
Faith in victories yet unseen
Spring awakening flares up, reality unfolds
Odyssey of the black praetorians
Asphalt soldiers stuck in obstinate mud
Death's head ussar's eternal march
False honor prospers betrayal stands tall
Aimfully oiling the engine of war
Sowing a wind
harvesting a storm
Faith in weapons yet to come
Crises the skeleton key cant unlock
Faith in victories yet unseen
Spring awakening flares up, reality unfolds
Twisting and turning
intensively burning
The flames of destruction through the city whirling
Through smoke and through screams on bloodthirsty machines
We storm forth in ecstasy to crush the resistance
Now let the carnage build up, let the cleansing begin
Explosions bursting out
ashen bell cloning in
All that is flesh shall bleed
all that is dry shall burn
None shall escape our wrath
death awaits at every turn
From under violent skies with violence in our hearts
Spewing forth hate and lead, pouring out fiery death
All that oppose us must perish in rampant flames
Over and over - again and again
Again and again and again and again shall we renew the massacre
Renew the slaughter and renew the genocide
Searching for flesh to burn, 
searching for blood to spill
Combing through ruins in search for survivors to kill
Demoniac dignity
seeking enlightenment through genocide
Barbed wire, grass fire, steel-armored death choir
Basks in the glare of the ever-growing pyre
Winged projectiles of death 
winged projectiles of doom
Turning whole cities into graves and smoking tombs
Relentless butchering, tireless killing-spree
Human vermin in flames
cleansing death meant to be
Cold oppression rising; panzer dawn
iron spring
Legions of black fueled with burning hate, bad wine and gin
Slaughterous symphony
searching redemption through this holy war
No room for prisoners, no room for mercy
No room for compassion or pity or sympathy
Hear the tank engine roar
hear the gun-barrels sing
As we run through everyone and through everything
War drums are beating
the wheels of death spinning
The freshly shed blood on our hands is as sweet as sin
Screaming artillery
deafening mortar shells
Tearing the streets to shreds
leaving nothing but a
Trail of destruction and cities beyond repair
The smell of burnt flesh and black powder fills in the air
Gunfire from above, gunfire from below
Marching through newly made mass graves with eyes aglow
Shellfire shakes the ground
iron wings fill the sky
Countless infantrymen armed and eager to die
All that is whole shall burst, all that stands up shall fall
until all that's left is the echo of this holy war
Murderous harmony
seeking fulfillment through thousand-fold death
One last bullet
One last round
One single motto:
Conquer or die
Our flag bleeding
On the ground
Riding the end times!
behind enemy lines!
Sudden flames greet
Muscle and bone
Last ditch warriors
Crawling like snakes
Poised to rise-up
In wolven shape
Nothing to conquer
Only to destroy
Trap encirclement complete
A new dawn bursts as
We spurn defeat
Sudden flames greet
Muscle and bone
Foaming horses in the night
Riding hussars of guiltless death
Sour milk and genocide
Kettle drum and bayonet
Equestrian blood lust
Equestrian attack!
Mounted squadrons riding east
Thundering hooves over Pripet marsh
Lured by the tunes of the coming feast
Blood on the blade and blood on the cross
Florian Geyer
beat the kettle drum
Florian Geyer
pray and death will come
Partisans bent down in fright
Deprived of courage and ready for death
No-one you know will live through the night
Resistance draws its final breath
Equestrian blood lust
Equestrian attack!
Mounted squadrons riding east
Thundering hooves over Pripet marsh
Lured by the tunes of the coming feast
Blood on the blade and blood on the cross
Bridles and stirrup
Death no longer awaits
Death is now!
Equestrian blood lust
Equestrian attack!
Equestrian blood lust
Equestrian attack!
Teutonic knights of old march once again
Grand horse of steel, sword of flame
the ground is shaking
Massive apparatus of death, 58 tons of hate
Un-forgivingly rolling in to seal your fate
Chariot of flames
Grinding the seeds of peace
Duels in the mist
Panzer fist
Cold steel predator on swift caterpillar bands
Carrying the voice of war in all the land
Voracious carnivore proven by killing score
Whose silhouette alone shall bring fear forevermore
Guardians of the Reich
Iron stars burning bright
Glorious iron sun
Thundering over frozen fields in remote Russian land
Hardship and battering in Tunisian sand
To hell and back and over Italian mountain-slopes
Normandy's green hedges hold the ending of hopes
Chariot of flames
Grinding the seeds of peace
Duels in the mist
Guardians of the Reich
Iron stars burning bright
Glorious iron sun
Guardians of the Reich
Iron stars burning bright
Glorious iron sun
Smeared with blood
And covered with the fine dust
Of a quaint baroque city no more
Dance of death
See Narva go down in flames
Dawn of wrath
a fate on wings of war
Wallonian guts cover the ground
Flemish remains piled up along the pavement
Russian ashes spread to the wind
Estonian limbs scattered across the town square of pain
Hammering
keep hammering
With bomb and with shell
Hammering
keep hammering
Again and again
All our hopes
Reduced to a fine powder
All our dreams
A pile of charred remains
Onward to the hills of the inferno
Orphanage and grenadier defaced
Norwegian blood like paint on the walls
German entrails all over the cobblestone street
Danish bodies burnt to a crisp
Swedish remains piled along the avenue of death
Hammering
keep hammering
With bomb and with shell
Hammering
keep hammering
Again and again
Riding the winds of blood
Heavy steps on the fuse between
Life and death and hell
Swift march on a road of swords and oaken leaves
One creed above the mud
One creed
sweat saves blood!
One creed above the mud
Shackled and caged
Frontline raptor with feathers burnt
Claw and hunger's pain
Eleven summers gone yet evading the rope
evading the rope
evading the rope
Cut are the wings of the last fallen
One creed above the mud
One creed
sweat saves blood!
One creed above the mud
Gently inviting death
Blowtorch-battalion flame long dead
Bare throat, shadow sings
One last cup of tea while waiting for the fire
for the fire
for the fire
Cursed is the crown of the last fallen
Slim and slender
fast as a grey hound
Tough as leather and hard as Krupp steel
Swearing loyalty to death beyond the torches' light
Steadfastly marching to the beat of the drum
Well-rehearsed
iron clanks from flank to flank
Eager for glory and hungry for cursed pride
Too young to fear death but just old enough to die
Steadfastly marching to the pulse of the gun
Slim and slender
fast as a grey hound
Tough as leather and hard as Krupp steel
Sowing blood to harvest honour in the Devil's trench
Carefully chosen to fight 'til kingdom come
Discipline
iron will from flank to flank
Obedience through blind self-sacrifice
Too young to know death but just old enough to kill
Fervently wading through the blood of the sun
Death, our comrade in arms
We are the black cohort
the skull-bearing swarm
We stand together, never alone
Just keep singing the Devil's song!
We bear the Devil's mark
Carved into our souls
And upper left arms
Death, our comrade in arms
We are the hounds of war
the swine of the front
We drink together, seldom alone
Just keep whistling the Devil's song!
Our heaven
Is the Great War
On earth we live in battle
Our eternal life
Our heaven
Is the Great War
On earth we live in battle
Our eternal life
Death, our comrade in arms
We are the knights of the blood
With skin like the sun
We fall together, sometimes alone
Just keep humming the Devil's song
Blood and iron
Poised dogs of war
Time to loosen the leash
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
In burning bridges light
Silent night
We share the sacred promise of death
Holy night
Aligned shall we enter the last breath
Silent night, holy night
Red snow
oh, love's pure light
Young blood, shining star
It's not your time to fall
Blood and iron
Victory is lost
But this was no defeat
Silent night
We share the sacred promise of death
Holy night
Aligned shall we enter the last breath
Silent night
We share the sacred promise of death
Holy night
Aligned shall we enter the last breath
Drifting
In the Air
Above a Cold Lake
Is a Soul
From an Early
Better Age
Grasping for
A Mystic Thought
In Vain... but Who's to Know
Further on Lies Eternal Search
For Theories to Lift the Gate
Only Locks Are Made Stronger
And More Keys Lost as Logic Fades
In the Pool of Dreams the Water Darkens
For the Soul That's Tired of Search
As Years Pass by
The Aura Drops
As Less and Less
Feelings Touch
Stupidity
Has Won too Much
The Hopeless Soul Keeps Mating
The Head is a Head of a Serpent
From its Nostrils Mucus Trickles...
The Ears Are those of a Basilisk
The Body is a Sun Fish, Full of Stars
His Horns Are Twisted into three Curls
The Base of His Feet Are Claws
A Sea Monster
A Form of Ea
Hear my Sword
in the Making
Of my Spell
Literally
The World's Tragedy, Is Served at My Feast
Worship Me
This is War
I Lie Wounded on Wintery Ground
With Hundred of Corpses around
Many Wounded Crawl Helplessly around
On the Blood Red Snowy Ground
War
Cries of the Suffering Sound
Cries for Help to All Their Dead Moms
War
Many Hours of Music
Many Drops of Blood
Many Shiverings and Now I Am Dead
And Still We Must Never Give up
War
The Fire in the Sky is Extinguished
Blue Waters no Longer Cry
The Dancing of Trees Has Stopped
The Stream of Freshness from Cold Winds
Exists no Longer
The Rain Has Stopped to Drip
From the Sky
Still Dripping Exists
From the Veins of a Nearly Dead Boy
Once There Was Hatred
Once There Was Cold
Now
There is Only
A Dark Stone Tomb
With an Altar
An Altar which
Serves As a Bed
A Bed of Eternal Sleep
The Dreams of the Human in Sleep
Are Dreams of Relief
A Gate out of Hell
Into the Void of Death
Yet Undisturbed
The Human Sleep
And One Day
Will the Grave Be Unlocked
And the Soul
Must Return to His World
But This Time as
A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit
Doomed To Haunt
Endlessly
I Immaterialize And Slowly Drift
Into the Unknown
With the Cold Winds with Soul
The Wintery Plains Lie Untouched
I Ride on My Elements
Towards the Stars Unseen
A Quest For Knowledge
In the Astral
Stench Intensifies
As I Near a Spectral Sphere
After a Hundred Men's Lifetime
In Analyzing
I learn To Consume
The Sphere Of Immense Power
And To Become Immortal
Darkness Hate and Winter
Rules the Earth when I Return
War Between Races
A Goal Is Reached
Chaos, Hate
An unknown voice called
From the tower, in which none lived
Beyond the forest
In that nothing lived
A call in the dream so beautiful
Like the voice of the queen of the night
We awoke and saw the moon
Partly covered from dark clouds
It was cold and wet
On our travel into the realm
The unborn thoughts
Finally we can see, what called us
Because we followed the voice tonight...
The Fire in the Sky is Extinguished
Blue Waters no Longer Cry
The Dancing of Trees Has Stopped
The Stream of Freshness from Cold Winds
Exists no Longer
The Rain Has Stopped to Drip
From the Sky
Still Dripping Exists
From the Veins of a Nearly Dead Boy
Once There Was Hatred
Once There Was Cold
Now
There is Only
A Dark Stone Tomb
With an Altar
An Altar which
Serves As a Bed
A Bed of Eternal Sleep
The Dreams of the Human in Sleep
Are Dreams of Relief
A Gate out of Hell
Into the Void of Death
Yet Undisturbed
The Human Sleep
And One Day
Will the Grave Be Unlocked
And the Soul
Must Return to His World
But This Time as
A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit
Doomed
To Haunt
Endlessly
My eyes are shut I cannot see
though clear is thy despair
I drift away
far away
from places of which you seek
Though I seek thy hell
yuo close the gate before me
Your life is right, and I'm to
follow to your paradise
I cannot fall in love
love is for them
Lusting for the sky
Heaven
Why did I come to this world
of sorrow why is this true
Where is my dagger of sacrifice
I will open the gates to Hell one day...
While we may believe
our world
our reality
to be that is
is but one
manifestation of the essence
Other planes lie beyond the reach
of normal sense and common roads
But they are no less real
than what we see or touch or feel
Denied by the blind church
because these are not the words of God
the same God that burnt the
knowing
Between the bushes we stared
At those who reminded us of another age
And told that hope was away
Forever
We heard elven song and
Water that trickled
What once was is now
Away
All the blood
All the longing and pain that
Ruled
And the emotions that could be stirred
Are away
Forever
We are not dead
We have never lived
A glade in the wood
Where the sun shines
Between the trees we are imprisoned
In this God's glade
It burns it scorches
When the light licks our flesh
Goes toward the sky a smoke
A cloud of our form
Prisoners of the burials
Tormented by God's goodness
No flame no hate
They were right we have come to Hell
Between misty vales
Between gloomy mountains
Under gray clouds
In the black night
On a proud horse
In black clothes
Strong weapons at hand
The infinity with dead trees
An eternity of cold
Over stone and wood
In the shadows
Out from the mist
Out from darkness
Out from the big shadows of the mountain
The castle of the dream...
So ends the ride
That lasted a lifetime
For the master goes in the castle of the dream
When night falls
she cloaks the world
in impenetrable darkness.
A chill rises
from the soil
and contaminates the air
suddenly...
life has new meaning.
I wonder how winter will be
with a spring that I shall never see
I wonder how night will be
with a day that I shall never see
I wonder how life will be
with a light I shall never see
I wonder how life will be
with a pain that lasts eternally
In every night there's a different black
in every night I wish that I was back
to the time when I rode
through the forests of old
In every winter there's a different cold
in every winter I feel so old
so very old as the night
so very old as the dreadful cold
I wonder how life will be
with a death that I shall never see
I wonder why life must be
a life that lasts eternally
I wonder how life will be
with a death that I shall never see
I wonder why life must be
a life that lasts eternally
Tears from the eyes so cold, tears from the eyes, 
in the grass so green.
As I lie here, the burden is being lifted once and for all, 
once and for all.
Beware of the light, it may take you away, 
to where no evil dwells.
It will take you away, for all eternity.
Night is so beautiful 
we need her as much as we need Day
The sorcerer climbs a tree
finds Earth's old pain,
cut it down in autumn peace,
with scissors cut out its heart.
Oak leaves fall to the ground,
sorcerer calls the spirits!
Oak leaves fall to the ground,
sorcerer magic verse trolleys!
Onion laid down in swaddling clothes,
Sorcerer ensure world peace;
Oak leaves fall to the ground,
sorcerer calls the spirits!
Oak leaves fall to the ground,
sorcerer magic verse trolleys!
Where is the burning force;
where is the earth fertile seas;
the shape of the sorcerer mighty shaft
She came from the water.
Bold and beautiful.
Mighty sorceress from below.
An icy rock came from the stars.
It melted on Earth,
dripping hearts of stone;
they grew into abominable horrors.
There was no end to it.
The ettins consumed the Earth
with dangerous sorcery
and neverending hunger.
Until they came,
the three gods:
They cast the horror into the abyss.
But many ettins remain,
dead and cold but alive,
dreaming and waiting
in the deep and dark places of the Earth.
I remember the shining sanguine Sun
the frozen forests and fallen leaves,
and the hollow hill under the sky.
I remember the complex cold caverns,
the long tranquil tunnels
and the large underground lakes.
I remember the dim depths of the Earth,
the lucid lady in the light
and her sacred stanza.
I remember the bright beast in her boat,
the tall troll telling her tales,
and the honey in the haunted hollow.
I remember the protected password,
the secret soothing symbol
I remember the red runes on the rock,
the spell of seeing being sung,
and the bold opening up of the beautiful burrow.
I remember the coming of man reborn,
the birth of Baldur the bright,
the return of a world that was woefully lost.
Lights in the lake.
Flickering phantoms.
Dancers in the deep.
White wonderful world.
Returning.
Rising.
Hovering.
Warming.
Illuminating.
Returning.
Hung in the tree of life.
Wounded. Bleeding.
I fall from the hall of gods!
The bond has been cut.
I cannot stand, nor speak.
I cannot crawl, nor think clearly.
I start over again. And again. And again.
The bond has been cut.
The tree has fallen.
The life of a god,
returns. Again.
There is no death for the honourable.
There is no end for the honourable.
Only eternal rebirth.
Dreams have swept me away.
Into a long forgotten realm.
Down into the depths of the Earth.
Into a hidden cavern.
Into the world below.
I walk into the forgotten past.
Do not turn around!
Never look back!
Fathers and mothers from ancient times.
Ghosts from a forgotten world.
With wonder they look upon me;
What took you so long?
I wander not in darkness.
I am not lost, nor bewildered.
The path is not hidden.
The tracks are not old.
I was here a moment ago.
I am home.
Your self-extinction
Suicide be thy name
Horrors blind to the dove
Shit on your blind and
Feeble innocence
Hovering over your false courage
Ghost hope and spent charity
Clinging to human frailty
Forces grind into your dove
A faith is lost you bring
With your scriptures
And when you kill yourself
Come visit me
Many spirits gather here.
Perseverance through this
Rite of purgery
Leaving your shit planet behind
Coldest of hells
Hatred of this world
Hatred of this life
The eyes of spectres
Which call to me
Infesting every moment
Invincible insanity
Unlife not meant for here
Never ending the sound
Rope creaking in mine night
The eyes of spectres
Which call to me
Reflecting every
Movement to die
Come with us
You belong to us
Kill yourself
You deserve this.
When the winds come down
Cacophonous and vast
The crude skull whisper
The creature blackens same
And a thunder coils
To clear a path
Mine soul blackens free
Now, mine vessel is but dust
With a luminous clap
Now thunder
This thunder
Mine heart blackens true.
Contamination
Numbness
Throttling in the blackened river
Of time and insane
Swallowed again
Drown again and
Deranged parasites
And a metallic green odor
So full the emptiness
Aimless
Withered scales decorate its
Skin and its falling away
Twist and writhe serpentine
Treason and peril
Thrust down the kill
Its eyes gaze animus
Are again as before
Dead except the eyes
Treason and peril.
Hidden in plain sight
Uttering unheard volumes
A soliloquy of the shadow
Darkest broad day-light
Cut through deep
Now set it free
Cut through deep
From these depths
The gift and chalice
Pain must be the course
I must have this
Don the horns and the skull
Pain is the path.
Winds whip past the hull
Screaming through
Straight to your heart
The scent of your weakness
Excites this metal
I will meet you with war
Igneous links hiss
As the winds arise
Searing fear into your heart
The scent of your weakness
Ignites this metal
Charred remnants of
Foes past
Bitter taste of ash
Your whimpers feed the flame
The scent of fear
And searing flesh
I will meet you with war.
Nucleus extols ice
A black cloak of night-shape
Powers before the beyond
Becoming the tomb of the sun
Lifeless burnt-out sphere
Now frozen to black
And ice is wept by the sun
Stifled by crystal universe
Arctic pitch black pyre
Of this sky no more
Lifeless burnt-out sphere
Self destruction universe.
I bid the body farewell
Slumped down and cold history
A voice to drown out
Taken in mine own hand
A blade, a rope, bitter poison
Climb into the nil realm
Beyond mortal pain
Poison coursing through the veins
And all is end
Dripping pain as fire
Puncture this vessel with metal
Drift out and onward
Tenth rung of a ghost climb
From the murky depths
A final consciousness
Slumped down there
Cold and history
Now comes invisible
Poison courses through
Veins on fire
A throat crushed closed
Puncture this vessel with metal
Flesh gash release.
Take wings at Midnight,
Under glimpses of a uncertain Moon
Her thoughts become scarcely human,
They infest and cloud her mind
And she longs for this rotting ill,
And the grim bolt of her king
She waits in bestial desire to meet her master's last words
Do you think I would except just any soul willing to give itself to mine power...
I torture and chastise you to ripen you for mine embrace...
Taking wings at midnight
Your flesh is relic,
Your vessel obsolete
The zenith of Reality's hood
Where Infinity runs its course
Deeply Satanic vapors seep once more inside,
Your flesh is relics, your obsolete
Your blood will stain your gold
Beyond reason
Beyond intellect
Your idea of Hope
From the land of loveless
Knowledge born of Darkness
Mine Forest Burned to the ground
Burned to the floor long ago
Cutting the night from mine heart
Basking silent in hatred
Rinsing, Rising
Proselytized to hatred
Steal on the thiever
Bearer of 666 diseases
Fuck, with the night, into mine heart
Cut, with the night, into mine heart!
A Collision of violent jagged stones of dead
Beach and soft pale flesh and brittle bone
The sun sets over the bloddy scene
Her Screams of terror roll off the shore,
Where once she bathed her fragile skin in the sun
She is now penetrated by demonic force
Stones grinding her flesh to pulp,
Leaving her unable to run
Spilling Cunt blood on the waves,
Water runs it's course
In every orifice there stabs a stone
In every cut she bleeds to death
In every orifice of her own
She watches her last breath
Crushing her beneath it's jagged edge,
Splitting her open violently
The many stones plummet upon her flesh, beating her
Silently fucking her
A vicious beating of rocks and stones
Hardened earth takes her
Pounding thrusts crush her bones
Serrated edges breaks her
Crush the dried petals of roses that bore light
Brandishing talons at the sun
Yawning and empty the petals wither
Only grayed stem remains
Revive the silence that the stars will again shine
Weep not for chalice and not for lurking inspiration
But for relief from grace, finally with grasp
Constellation
An again the sea of wasted, wasted scent of Venus
Venus casts down the decry
Decry tainted spice red, red is the number of the spider
Spider's web rehearsed acidic
Acid creates the pattern
Pattern marked onto naked flesh and the flesh is now grass
Tall grass that cloaks the serpent, the serpent that which births the stone
The stone is inscribed with law, 
but the law conflicts with virtue
And virtue sheds a thousand tears
Tears upon which you Trample, and drown becomin again serpent
Fear steals a voice
The price paid for dreaming
This is the cloud that lumbers across vision
A canopy of paranoia threatening light at its sting
Visions of existence appear and recede
For isn't it the end that makes passion rise
And isn't it the during that raises the chalice of tears
Hovering just above blind earth,
To join with her mist
Some never never embrace
Reach and grasp this frost-bitten heart
Stench and smoke bellow from under
Dispersed in dark womb of night
This gleaming harlot reflects the magician
And the child's horns mirror hers
Longing to travel with she
Skinless and away
Head thrown back in defiance
Belly thrust forward
Grotesque
A vagina full of feverish visions and the foul fiend peers from behind her eyes
A whore
Christ is lowered, needing thoughts to exist
A wicked time is at hand
This tone your holocaust
And virtue is for the dead
Cold cacophony surround you mind
Trade slavery
Slave traitor
Bloodied, chained and dying
Freedom is a vice of your mind
Born of idiocry
Among mountains of whispered lies
And the trails of the foe
With the fate of the muse unsure
Assumed ambiguous in rust
You depart toward death and war
So obedient
Back turned to the winter
You fashion this direction
Still the bleakness will not submit
The eye's sight scrapes back and forth 
against the frame of death mask slit
The mouth gurgles forth
A black matter thick and putrid
Naught ears detect the rattle
The hissing crackle of time
Space
The vessel convulses in rhythm with torment and space
Space
The air cuts the skins
Force now under
Bandages hands tear and pull at the chest cavity
Screamin all the meat away in a epileptic frenzy
Searching to not exit
The feet wait silent in a pool of excrement and blood and still the mouth gurgles forth
A black matter thick an putrid
Sorrow rains down, hatred reigns now
If satan be mine only audience
So shall it be
Misfortune
Ailment
A curse
Cave scorpions across the lips
A curse
As I cut mine flesh
I send this to you
As I bleed,
As I heal
I send you the misery of Existence
A curse
I see your stink
Cunt
Suffer
Mine Portrait in Scars
The color has left
Gone away from mine face
Banished by the din
The bog in mine skull
The silence of alone
Within the blossom of regret
The bitter potion
Of bitter silence
Against the last words
Spoken alone
Spoken alone
A new pair of useless eyes
Death is the medicine
Heart replaced with stone and a necklace of scars
I plunge this equation into mine veins
Mine voice so far from mine voice
Mine hand so far from mine own hand
Voices from the angel on mine left thumb
Whisper terrible words and perversities
From a long flagellated vessel
Oh more, much much more is found of us
From the pandemonium
Begins the nativity of sin and death
Becoming most vain serpent
Everlasting perverse calculus
Heart replaced with stone
And a necklace of scars
From a long flagellated vessel
Now mine voice, mine hand, and mine heart
Herald the glorious becoming
The most vile of secrets
All of this troth
Given to mortification
Face down and obedient
Truths illuminated, no longer obscured
Full in emptiness complete
In wonder of malignant spirit
Impious yet desiderative
Plunge this equation into thy vein
Regurgitating on the crown of Sabbath
The essence of seraphim
Merging with sword, onto them
And the seamless garment like the morning
Dipped in the blood of men
Made as the filth of the world
And overwhelming to direct vision
Becoming the agents of torment
Veins filled with the serum of prophesy
Becoming the agents of torment
Eyes weeping the tears of prophesy
Become the agents of torment
Ears filled with the semen of prophesy
Ultimate acts of perverted intimacy
Nary a soul left without the punishment
Mountains now full of yours
Surrounded by their own graves
Let no warning sound from the trumpets of gold
Become the beginning of the end for the land of the living
Delivered to death those of the whole of the globe
From the death of all
Also claims those who call for it
And none shall escape this
Be as shadows amongst the nations
And cause great mourning
Wings upon wings upon wings
Cause men to die
Filled with iniquity and perfection
Swallowing the holy mountain of god
And its fiery stones
Incense down from capsized center
Raise this voice to the ashes of the world
Still hemorrhaging from the intoxication of rhema
Dwelling within the hand of desolation
Merging the sword, onto them
The heir apparent
And inflicter of delicious agony
The whole of the human race
Gone as T-lymphocytes
A glory that shines in every atrocity
Reveals itself in every vile act
Cleans itself in despondence
And the pit known only to broken men
Deafening are its secrets
Again attacking sanctity
With blasphemy and fornication
A law written as it is spoken
Past crooked lips
And the pit known only to broken men
Deafening are its secrets
Every particle of hatred
Sends direct for convocation
This world is for death
Parched and barren
Conduit to the suffering of the universe
And the grasp of its destructiveness
Cannot slumber
From this pit of degradation
Eyes, tongue and sword
Suckle at the honey
Sour, dejected and wretched
Risen above the calls of the flesh
Tearing deeper
Tearing deeper
And again the massive conspiracy against all life
No air
No exit
Futility is the first gradual
Then utter
All are, at once, taken to the destroying place
And under the crossroads
To keep the corpses down 
Talons clutch high cheekbones
Phallus invades now swollen throat
A thorn reaches to fertilize the withered egg
Peril barbed and resistant
Emerging from tremendous heat
Primeval atom born of great fulmination
Gravitationally attracted to the forming matter
The inflation of the cosmos
Receive the world
Larva formed in glorious negativity
Another form readying the destroyer
The hideous is finally set forth
Face upturned towards the pillar that suspends Him
The brood of invisible ones shall never be named
Form without limbs readying the time end
The becoming of awe
Away from human frame
Form without limbs
Mouth beckoning the end of man
The unspeakable instrument will move through them
Reach within to see this free
And set fire onto me
And then the division
Division of most grotesque cells
Given to utter vexation and vulgar asceticism
Revealing in the blows
From the unseen accuser
Not only to bear witness
But attain evidence
Skin becomes to the tearing under fresh affliction
Sweat now mingles with the blood of gross hematuria
From the head
Down the back
Passing the thigh
For it is he that breath hatred onto censuring
And the stones are covered with this blood
Arms to torso and leg to leg
Now adhered with this
Each new blow
A echo of the last
Yellowed orbs rolling under these eyelids
The limbs give way
The last cry of joy
Forever and ever
Chin bobs the shoulder amidst great pallor
This figure is now folded and crimson
Arms and legs bound with pus and wax-like crust
Covering the feet of the accuser
This work is complete
Its essence lies dormant
Within every willing host
Waiting to release its malice
Waiting to spread perverse lies
Biding to crush and extinguish
Death stretches His arm
Across the whole of the globe
In His embrace
Blessed with blisters
Succumbing to its wounds
Every scar a joyous victory
Ever break open
Dispatching His ugliness
Across the whole of the globe
In embrace blessed with blisters
Depraved indifference to human life
Blessed with blisters
Now shown the fruits of suffering
And the grief of all that is made
Depraved indifference to human life
Blessed with blisters
Walking the fire
Behold and shine with purpose
Rejoice
Flower of worms begats the sword shown the world of perfidy
Rejoice
Awakened now and unmerciful
You shall have all nations in derision
Becoming the catalyst of indignation
March towards wicked transformations
Slither from mine pallet that I might maintain your living ash
Living ash
Consume them with your fire
Rejoice
Flower of worms begats the sword shown the world of perfidy
With poisoned arrows
Consume them that they may not be
Enveloping them with delicious suffering
Rejoice
Flower of worms begats the sword shown the world of perfidy
Consume them that they may not be
And deliver much agony
The mass crucifixion of the sons of Adam
Dispatched by ignious ophidian
Constained abyssal order
Announcing the true fruits of the fall
Become the catalyst of indignation
Rejoice
And with terrible and tyrannical death
Oh, restore us again
His beacon severes vision
Again alight from under
Crossing out their eyes
All vision ignored
Erasing the murmurs
Not want an utterance
Name and shape still unrevealed
Stabbing at the years he holds this audition
Dismantling all vessels of labor
Stumbling to reach the inception
No more can we be found
For belief cannot be seen
It is the frequency of day
Commencing with dry stutters
Begins the nucleus
We are found no more
But a scarred key
And the altered ticket
And tremendous ficitons
Subterrestrial illuminations
We are found
Nothing
But one piece of his whole
Within highest praise
And sought subjugation
Within woe and squaller
Countenance ever fallen
Dawning
The leering break of day
And penitence
Unto gowns of sacrifice
Unscathed nor weary
The Gardens of Coprolite
The Gardens of Coprolite
All of us have become like one who is unclean, 
and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags
we all shrivel up and like the wind our sins sweep us away
The Gardens of Coprolite
Deceiving within your own selves
Shunning libelous laws
Therefore, the word, not flesh, is lived
The Gardens of Coprolite
And again the staggering vomit vexations
Manifesting in the hearts of man
Recitation from tomes of trepidation
Peering up the frock of glory within wicked fields of calm
The lesions lessons
His image ever a reminder
Iconic respire
Thesis ever unaltered
Endless veils ever hidden
Now they have lifted the shrine
Passing the seed through fire
Visage of the abyss set against you
Holy! Holy! Holy!
Most savage of faiths
His mark
Holy! Holy! Holy!
Ever igneous tongue of eremitic gospels
The death of the gloaming
Ever your derision
Within a cocoon of falsity
Again turn mine place where knives lay
Turn it toward your laments
All encompassing compromise
Leech of leper lives
The gloaming is buried
Turn it toward your laments
Mine place where knives lay
Long repudiated tears
Flaming serpent of orbs
Fall unto the hands of this angel
Five hundred years tall
Unremoved of spirit
Flaming serpent of orbs
Five hundred years tall
Waiting certain and shorn
Within barren searches
Five hundred years tall
And unremoved of spirit
Churning
Always growing
Churning
Always groaning
Roaming salacious and insatiable
Not destroyed by the glorious
Permitting most obscene tantra
How you knew the dusk
Ever
Divine courtesan
Amidst these worn hearts
Increase pressure
Oh the diamond of misery
Jewel of such oblivion
Pacing again
Still no reply
For where purpose wilted
Loss and regret bloomed
Life after life
Learning nothing
Within final extremity
Beside the last breath exhaled
And again pale to the center
Stumbling
Stuttering
Nil light reigns
Only tattered accusations
Paling to the comparison
Now utterly drained
And all wonder is banished
Life after life
Absorbing
Nothing
Tracing the circle
serpent's diamond
One and all now black
Maw overflowing with dense menses
Tracing the circle; serpent's locutions
Shiny the slattern form
Holiest of devourments
Sacred
Tracing the circle
serpent's thunderbolt
The acolytes of filth
Rinsed in vice and glorious knavery
Made as the filth of the world
In much fear and trembling
Head shorn in prophecy
Baptised in opaqueness
Slattern despot
Within such turpitude
Tracing the circle 
serpent's thunderbolt
Readies the blade of Cain
Down diamond flights
But a single clutch of ashes
All tongues toward the void
Olding and encircling time
A saturn beyond mortal perception
Within her briar fortress
All are both
All are oblivion
All are alive
All are extinction
Attempts so tragic
Origin of ritual
Upon your knees
Singing
But still on your knees
Fraudulent Thaumiel
Colorless polycephalic evolution
Hanged by your own
Tighten the sword
Veil of mad spirits
Tethered in roily belief
And I can smell your fear again
Paralyzed by doubt
Writhing
Ever within your own consciousness
Trapped in division
Barren
Tethered in roily belief
Upon your knees
Singing
But still on your knees
Bleeding sky is tonight
Seperationof gods
Blasphesy's cries in the middle hill
Divine ghost
Black the cross, bloody thorn
The horn shaped against the holy son
Infernal land
Scream the sky
It's tonight or yesterday
Blasphemy in godland
The holy land is offensed
Sabbatic light, the goatshaped
It's the final fullmoon
The final chapter
Winds of chilling mayhem
Reborn through uman blood
Narahousa raped and disgraced
Singing ancient necropsalms
They tresspass with no fear
The mystical acheron
Marking the point of voris
In the dust
They wait in silence
The cryptic sacrifice
Transformed into the winged leizard
Floating in distant unkown zones
To welcome the great whore of babylon
Nocternal fog cover the river
The poisened water
The cursed bride of pyramids
After wind she appears
The blood kiss on his lips
She wears the crown of beauty
Obssessed by the thirst of power
Unholy dark angels fallen for ages
blaspheme the ghost
Dark warriors celebrate the final dowraction
Turn the light off obey the megagoal
Ultimate triuph
In our masters name
The forest call its back low
Listen the winds
Listen the wolfs
The glorious beast
Half man half wolf
Ancient soul in another skin
Shadows fall deep within
The mystic wood open at night
Vampires creep in dark light
Vicious joy and black delight
Behind each kiss a poison bite
Exposed to darkness once more
Proceeding in evil deed at gore
Concealed deep inside coffins
For ages now begins to raise
Spirally walking just like apes
Feasting their ultimate triumph
Baptized in the unholy catacombs
They drift await but sleep await
The cry of their victims
The lives they take
My soul is trembling, 
Asphyxiated exhalation
But, feel like my name
Starting around the tombs of marble
Untouched carry the crew of ages
An unwed coffin attracts me
Inside the fear an odd wonder
Strange prompting as I read the name
now rest in my new dwelling
the property calls
I'm the old coffin spirit
Master and slave on my own land
Well hidden behind the pute stars
Fluttering in distant unknown zones
Macabre dance with the diastric winds
hrismed to haunt the kiss of light
Circle within circle
the sacred hours come
they passed to obscure deeds
the final step before the meeting
What I wish appears in my sleep
surpass the whole mortal life
as sucubus creeps in my cold room
tresspass the invisible zone
Archeogonic theory is fallen by reborn
those who believed the one
follow the light now
marking the way to mystical meeting
I travelled with him in uncontrolled dimensions
I knew the forbidden plateau of length
Kuntath the freezing desert
beyond the gate of Silver key
Inside the eye of Algond
I saw from distance
down the zodiac
Inside the secret eye
the star of famelot
touch the top of down of tree
you can invoke
Oh south spirit
Remove the sea wind
Recall the first flame
Awake the beast under the snow
In three shades
The sign of evil existence
Engraved in rain
Above the circle where tyrants dwell
Summon Glohithia
Appear in the snake shape
Bring down upon me
For last time all forest's secrets
The sign of evil existence
In the four points of horizon
The secrets buried under smoky land
It'll take ages and ages come back
The wind is here now
The see is divided
The flame reburn inside me
The beast return in the snowy land
Summon Glohithia
Appear in the snake shape
Bring down upon me
For last time all forest's secrets
Million eyes and million souls
Never seen beyond the zone
As Charon proclaim the law
Winds come front, 
reveal the ones who gone
Transform all suffering into plagues
The slaves never seen beyond
Forever locked behind the rusty door
Naked suffer but they never die
In chains polluted, bless they alive
Wild annihilating riders
Made in bowels of the earth
Defend the chariot arise in tartar
On winged horses they attack
Transform all suffering into plagues
Transform all suffering into plagues
Mayhemic curses once predicted
Worthless humans beg their death
Eternal suffer miserables
The curse of Nath
The curse of Iostha
Walk through sensual rivers
An energy weakening sensations
Certainly infect the hypnotized target
Never stop to suffer
Miserables
Million eyes and million souls
Never seen beyond the zone
As Charon proclaim the law
Winds come front, reveal the ones who gone
Transform all suffering into plagues
In lust time come forth
Arise from the chaos nights
Thy majesty devour the son
Thy gift deserves you
The offer of Absu
Fgmenth beloved successor
See all dreams come true
Deliver us to him
Obey in the power create me
Inside my eyes your sight
Inside my mind your voice
A silent word attack me
It's called Razal Tach
The one connect our lifes
Broken faces behind the idol
Self sacrifce believers once betrayed
Those who disregarded authorities
In deadly position they offend
The junless domain
For ages and ages
Where his sleeping majesty
Under the black sand
Skeletoned shapes look lifeless
Thrones disappear in dusty old centuries
Where glory hide the myth
Nothing to see those who died
The junless domain
For ages and ages
Where his sleeping majesty
Under the black sand
Invaders who follow the legends
Spread mouth to mouth
Approach the phenomically quiet graveyard
Well hidden lonny sentinels
Around his sandy dwelling
Out of date carnivorous suvivorous
They offend his sleeping majesty
The events can be said by human words
So strength so hate to those who dare
They break the frontiers and they come
Now dust of melting bones
Mixed with the Sandy land
Broken faces behind the idol
Self sacrifce believers once betrayed
Those who disregarded authorities
In deadly position they offend
Fallen in decay
Inflowing shades
The oppressed revolt
Removed in dark spheres
Once exiled
Blessed...
In abyssia
Iria, Uthopia, come here
Believe in us and be like us
Taste the lusts and feed revenge
For those who dare exile you
Release all wrath, feel it
You're in the sixth communion
Never forget what happened
As marked you arrived
Since now
I name you under our cult
Enter the tunnel
Emit no emotion
Engaged with our hierarchy
Keep the mystic way to go
All father's treasure
The upcoming mighty contract
The sight of Therion
Incarnation
Illumination of darkness
Intuition
Angels who embraced
Attached to underworld
Proselytized in the land
They refuge
Exiled now survived
Exiled be opposed
Immigration in the Abyss
Immense to the heart
In front of me, the red ocean
Where no limits, no motion below
A mystic way to underworld
For million years and more
So wild call me
To fall down
Its red waves await me
Show me where I belong
Painted in colours
Mesmerised in purple
I trespass with no fear
Frontiers and doubts
Above the highest
Teach me where
All powers come from
Tonight my voice will echo in Abyss
For years falling down
The doop I'm here for
The promises beyond
A new reality I adore
It's the day of coronation
As the years passed we celebrate
The ultimate unholy domination
A tribute to the serpent king
In front of king I stare
At the golden crown
Half dressed the colourfull lined skin
He bows as the crown
Adore the naked head
The serpent all time creeps
In the name of Serpent
In the name of King
At the throne serpent lay
Eat ravenously raw fleshes
Sarcastic pay for human tribe
Among the flames the sky eyes
Coronation of the Serpent
The shinest of angel
Rebelous spirit
Everlasting power
Share the creation
unholy master
prince of fire
Into the storm he comes
Release the wrath
The glorious one
The evil dark knight
Across the moon
Freezing the desert
Seven dark angels
In seven dark lands
Be ready for his coming
In the forest of N Ga
Avoid meet with light rags
The one who list the night
The shinest of angel
Rebelous spirit
Everlasting power
Share the creation
unholy master
prince of fire
Excavate the ancient tomp
Expansion of my doom
Converge to the empty coffin
A kingdom under catacomb
Furrowed background
And a flute to paint the atmosphere
The fifth illusion
Self delusion of reality
The fifth illusion
Prison warder for your dreams
A kingdom under catacomb
Furrowed background
Neutralize your fantasy
Banishment
Spiritual abusement
His excellence
The fifth illusion
Self delusion of reality
The fifth illusion
Prison warder for your dreams
In the messy forest
Metabolism of the wolf
Mirage of reality
When the chacal came into view
Mining of clear power
Reach manhood in pure steel
It's thundering & lightning
Beast's eyes flashed with anger
Wolfera the chacal
Walk by starlight
Wolfera the chacal
call it misanthropist
A dreamlike physical build
Piggish habbits
The fetim race
The newcomer
A new generation
A new breed
The newly weds
Neoplasia
The tooth painted with hunter's blood
Entracing the hunger's look
Equivalent in the book of strength
Eradicate the soul of the land
Emotion
Buring wooden icons
Menial man
In the candleshadow
Notorious King
Unblessed and Isolated
Open his wings
Lord himself
Enter to abyss
Subterranean Ambitions
The undersinged
Never submit
Like flame he escaped
Underestimate the mankind
Unleashed he rule
Shifty bites the heel
Make red-hot under earth
With the face of angel
In flirt with sin
His voice in eternity
Fade to cold, beyond false arch
Colourfull pictures taken of a dead mind
Lifeless boatman in the shore of lake
The tide will bring you
The fullmoon removed now
A mute riot with a horrific smell
Extencive perpetuation
Succeed the simple thought
Manifest of a new reality
Morallity of a dark age
Special voice
Rise above
Ashes and Bones
The law decide
Transmit my word
Divided society, man against man
Dogmatic philosophy, instincts of age
Vibration skinning the map
Like a satelite I watch all your moves
Quarter fo a year
Is enough
The triangle cover all angles
Just touch the ground & See your hands
Two thousand years after christ
Dark Age
Ride this glorious night
All lords from beyond
Galaxial dust above the cosmic temple
Decisions have taken
Stars turn to dark
The chains are tighter
Slaves turn to blind
Bleeding knowledge wasn't enough
Universal deity stand so high
Unfair crime malicious war
The tormen's cries religious lust
Stones of snow
Massive jail
Masochits love
Slaves of ice
Twelve thrones, Around the temple
Twelve kings, Twelve sons
Twelve kingdoms, Twelve new planets
Where flames burn the flesh
Where ice cold the soul
Where mortals have no pride
Nost I'm the Glory
The symbol of Lory
Bring me the crystal
Univerce i'm your lord now
Panthers around my throne
My daughter's blood
My palace appear
Mephesis of black crystal
Carry the charriot
I ride tilveria
The crystal in the right side
Winged plasma
You will never arise
Clean as the water
You'll see into my soul
The rings in my fingers
Each word each order
You'll never smell the flowers again
You'll never see the ocean
The crystallic orizon
I paint all the walls in black
Petrified shadows
Malevolent motives
Open the fifth gate of lent
Enter to a snowy fantasmagoria
Emerge from nowhere
No father no mother
An unnature utterus
The white seas with dead fishes
Without sense
Feeling logic
Completely cold
Crystalized the riversides the hills
Glacial Strength
From the glacial era
Torment in icefall
The ice shaped god
As lernaean hydra recover its plagues
Throw onself into a fight
Long for its predestination
Opposite to the hot rays
Into the propylaea of victory
Adapted to human form
Bodes ill for the country
The fall of man
Mystic passage in saveland
I saw all glory in black gold
The earthly dwelling a crypt of cold
I experience my-self into known maths
Escay of dawn
I'm alone
Transformed into stone
Saturn unlock avey's son
Volcanic explosion
Tartarus son
An unnature embryo
A horrific born
A gold bell, a black ring
The kiss of Musthmur
Bless him
Oh faithfull servant, oh faithfull beast
Flatter my will, follow my path
Revive my wrath
Romanian moon, the count rides moonlight
Call me to serve him, release him from grave
Onward to the mountains, the wild castle wear its black
With respect I obey the blood land
I kiss the ground my lips on red
the king of the inner dominion
the circle of the lost lovers
those who start the monarchy
melodies of them who gave up the ghost
a new sovereign
son of the first king
after the seizure plague
dressed in serrated armour
sensual descendant
of carnal love
semaphore
of all unearthly souls
married
to the divine war
king of a stellar war
dedicated to his father's vow
swear in power to low
asylum in his world
dazzle his hordes
emeron
thousand meters under
buried city of ice
observance of the prophecy
the water melts the ice
crystal logic
barbarian king
preserved for centuries
the missing link
shining glory
freezing myth
sallow mass
in the war they pass
living by night
never seen the sun
the rays against
cold gloomy faith
cross the outer space
near the inner domain
in the freezing star of thuge
starting place, safe refuge
read minds of their enemies
strategy, defense
in an unequal battle
throw waves of cold
a vision comes true
a dead man that returns
a mythic horse pronounces him
as an emperor returned
followed by black moves
contrast the white horse
aliens' dark motives
the army of the beloved
thousand waves swallow him
dance under the grey skin
shades get life and follow him
the shadows call
the planets call
the echoes in the other world
the chapter goes right
the prophecy will be done
time signed the last king
who's buried under ice
All my dreams take me backwards
I can see a little child
His mother in black
Kissing the dead brother
It's snowing still
Kissing the dead brother
It's snowing still
In a pleasure touched by death
Snow falls, cover the body
Cold doesn't touch her
Ice melts as the warm tears fall
In a lake of white
Swans stare at their direction
Sad they live
Strange birds are coming
Kissing the dead brother
It's snowing still
Kissing the dead brother
It's snowing still
Although early the night falls
Tears turn to ice by cold
The snow covers his body
And the snow stops falling
The tears which black swans bring
Over his dead body
The next dawn
Together dead they will be
All my dreams take me backwards
I can see a little child
His mother in black
In a pleasure touched by death
Snow falls, cover the body
Cold doesn't touch her
Ice melts as the warm tears fall
Kissing the dead brother
It's snowing still
Kissing the dead brother
It's snowing still
different words
empty mouths
dead faces
in a shadow world
i've seen one season
i've felt only cold
i'm so alone
ride over
fall within
shadows follow
swallow me
a face in the window
it thinks but it's senseless
it sees but it's blind
it sounds but it's dead
mesmerized in loneliness
into colourful walls
my shadow, my company
it will last so long
once again in my window
this winter will last forever
among deep green hills
two eyes get lost in forests
crystal flower images slip
among the trunks of the trees
visions appear from the ground
shades without roots but still exist
strange animals
an eternal vital chain
monstrous pre-historic
a level of unearthly power
but still...
everything flows
some kind of a magic scar
everything gets harmonized
with the move of light
quick move of image
impossible to stay untouched
material follows the equilibrium
quickly release the earthly flesh
carbonic meteorites
volcanoes throw cold
volcanic explosions
the universe's bond
priceless treasures
the explosion born
buried forever
under coal
surrounded by thorns
unwrought stones
amphoras and bones
those cultures that are gone
beyond all fantasy
somewhere in polar stars
never imagine
the mineral world
confused planets
alchemy
relightened stars
alchemy
stench of fumes
alchemy
a diastric alchemy
refresh the cold
moon dust
above all
your treasure is held
wisdom
the universe's law
a deadly song is coming
meet the sound of waves
the blind wizard
stands on the highest rock
remembers all that's seen
and makes pessimistic prophecies
these are his latest hours
in the mortal world
atheron charon's beloved child
comes singing the march
the sun, the water, the land
the old man loses his sense
after the bright light
a yound soul released
an old body floating on the sea
the poorest side of the universe
among wild horizons
you'll feel the immortality
you'll step on the opposite bank
a body became a prison
an eternal soul
come to me
you will be able
you go everywhere
you see everything
the north strongest wind
throw arrows in the high wall
a captive will survive
free he will revive
from town to town
in the distant sea
he'll bring an army
of poor and miserable
an earthquake will happen
thousands will be killed
the big theatre
filled with a crowd
will be creaked
fire in the east
victory's feast
the hunting eagle
has landed in the east
the sky is burning
the slaves rebel
the king is dead
a new age revealed
the space is empty
the tyrants laid in earth
the slaves unlock the chains
the first field of the battle
Counting the time
Waiting for the crime
The loss of innocence
A faint reminiscence
I'm in the twilight
Surrounded by the night
The memories have been disgraced
The scene is still unchanged
The time is near
The message is clear
The battle will be fought
Fight now.
Fear not.
I keep still
I am trying to feel
The hate that's within you
I'm going to win you
I was mistaken
I was forgotten
Unbroken silence
Absolute violence
I praise the song of defeat
I am the bottom and he's the summit
A sorrowful farewell
Where does salvation dwell?
Full moon
raise the rainbow
The sea experts
prepare the bow
An optical miracle
a moon as high as one
It buzzes around your ears
An easy day will follow the twilight
It must be the last full moon
It's near the promised time
Two thunders
High strain
Threaten the mankind
Among two storms
It's hot although it's midnight
The mothers died at once
Father itself the rainbow
Both sons will last no more
The thunder bears two mothers
The mother bears two sons
Echoes in the distance
All turn to sun's size
It's the season the trees die
The birds don't sing nomore
The rivers never come back
Nature dies out.
It's the season the trees die
The birds don't sing nomore
The rivers never come back
Nature dies out.
Focus tomorrow's horizon
Sorrow means no future
Cover my face
With my guilty hands
This tragic future
Destined to hurt never heal
What end can save me?
What good gives me an end?
It's the season the trees die
The birds don't sing no more
The rivers never come back
Nature dies out.
It's the season the trees die
The birds don't sing no more
The rivers never come back
Nature dies out.
First passion
Now is lost
A dramatic dead story
I killed all I have
My sadness translated into madness
I spell meaningless words
A poem for sorrow and death
Nothing is innocent
Nothing is fair
I keep wondering
I keep wondering
How did I end up like this?
Focus tomorrow's horizon
Sorrow means no future
Cover my face
With my guilty hands
This tragic future
Destined to hurt never heal
What end can save me?
What good gives me an end?
Great dilemma
Detestable thoughts
Non-existing facts
Ans it`s the grief that accompanies you
Life and death are struggling
The outcome is wavering
The decision is ours
But the truth escapes me
The sadness of bereavement
The loss of innocence
Hate made an untrodded path
Of my soul
I walk lightly
Trying not to wake
My sleeping consciousness
Trying to resist myself
The fate has schemed
Against us
The weak are condemned
Fear now
I want to be alive
But my soul is asleep
You can say whatever
I go on all alone
The night absorbs reality
And releases fantasy
It tickles my vanity
And throws me into ecstasy
The abyss of illusion
Reveals a fairy land
I am in confusion
For I've got out of hand
The fairies of the night
Surround me, beset me
Fear is their delight They will try to take me
The new moon salutes me
The wind whispers a word
The wicked witches embrace me
And touch me with their magic hand
And I become air
And I become fire
The enemies filled with despair
As I am getting higher and higher
I have gained the wisdom
I have honoured the spell
I have conquered the stardom
I have beaten the night as well
Innocence arrives with dawn
All creatures start to die
They leave me alone
And are eager for the night
Shall I tell you the legend?
About a garden wearing is black
I`ll tell you about the whispers
The dark eyes of night
Moonlight is the brightness
Before each dawn
I lose my beauty
I lose my light
Full is the night
Fulfills my mind
The painters are the stars
Mix black with white
Pain all trees
The flowers
The waters
Full colours is the night
Free ride with the wind
With the queen of the night
Under the spell of her cold eyes
I dressed all i dress
Smell my difference
See my only love
Take no colours
Mesmerized in night
Open me a gate
Through the red sky
Give me the power of two lions
The eye of the falcon
Your blood in my veins
What destiny will follow
Under your divine will
Into brave lands
I will drift
Semigod from your love with a mortal
woman
Half man, half god
I threw my soul
Into your world
One wise
Only sly evil eye
And the magic following me
Nothing can scare me
Nothing moves me
Nothing burns me
Nothing kills me
Nothing beats me
The drums of time I have stopped
The ecstatic quietude
Sucks up every fear
And every desire
Illusions of the moment
Featureless figures
Intensified feelings
I'm running behind my shadow
In this vastness
I can feel your presence
I cannot understand
Your misleading words
Inconceivable beauty
Sweet melody
Forgotten senses
Are waking up
Dark is the night
Always and never
This is the time
Of total purification
Lost in thoughts
Trying to touch
The perfect moment
But the clock strikes again
Let the silence talk
Let my fire walk
The path of despair
Confess your sins if you dare
I play with fear
Guilt is coming near
Challenge me
But don't judge me
The tree of my pride
Has grown up so wild
I`m the one who endures
Ira incensus
All efforts in vain
My life is pain
I`m reaching the truth
And death is the proof
The last of my kind
I`m losing my mind
The pain has gone
But I'm alone
I fight on my way
The skills i have shown
Abandon, desert me
The secret is going to break me
I cry for me
Despair is all I see
The night is spreading
My life is ending
LONG SUPPRESSED DESIRE
LUST BECOMES RAGING FIRE
FEEL THE PAIN INSIDE ME
LET MY SOUL FLY FREE
I TRAVEL THE FOUR HORIZONS
THE SEVEN SEAS I CROSS
SHAPES, FEELINGS, ICONS
SENTIMENT AND PATHOS
FEEL, DENY, REVEAL REGAIN
TOUCH MY SOUL PART ONCE AGAIN
AND SEE INTO MY EYES
NEVER AGAIN WILL I DREAM
NEVER AGAIN WILL I SCREAM
ALL MY SENSES ARE SHARP LIKE ICE
DEATH WITHIN A CRY
NO AGONY, NO LIE
WHERE IS THE BEGINNING?
THERE IS NO MEANING
I DIVE INTO FEAR
THE BREATH OF NIGHT IS HERE
UNDRESS MY BODY AND MY SOUL
AND TEACH ME MY ROLE
YOUR HANDS ARE NETS OF GOLD
THAT TRAP ME IN YOUR WORLD
A WORLD OF LIGHT
A MOONLIT NIGHT
The old glory is failed
The old emperor in a lonely empire
Eternity so shiny
But followed by no one
Among the crowd
Princes 8 kings
Those who defeated
All lovers of monarchy
The sky is mourning
Near to the sun 
human blood
It's too late for nation
After this misery
A bigger one is coming
The promised centuries
recycling
The dog have died
Around the tyrant
Mythic sovereigns
In sea and land
Shout loud
But voices come back
The eagle has throwned
The beast has enough
The days of the omen
Visions of the dead lovers
Circle within circle
the sacred hours come
they passed to obscure deeds
the final step before the meeting
What I wish appears in my sleep
surpass the whole mortal life
as succubus creeps in my cold room
tresspass the invisible zone
Archeogonic theory is fallen by reborn
those who believed the one
follow the light now
marking the way to mystical meeting
Riding in darkness
Through the hell of the night
Give all your torment to the heaven's might
In the name of Satan spread all your fear
You feel his anger you know he's near
Casting a spell
Lord of all hells
Ripping all angels
God has fell
Tormentor
Baphomet's calling death is now real
Helldogs and demons waiting to kill
Pentagrams shining Lucifer smiles
Fucking the virgin rip our her eyes
Drinking the blood
Fear no God
Now you are dead
Your flesh is dot rot
Dark shadows lie
Over the city
Tonight someone will die
You can hear painful screams
The air is full of flies
Mayhemic legions are ready
To steal the human souls
Come into my vault and do like you get told
I'll eat your intestines
No matter if you pray of please
I'll bring you down to your knees
Tonight you're gonna meet your fate
You try to run but it's too late
I am here to liquidate
Time to raise the flag of hate
Destroy the earth is our only aim
To strike all down is the only way
To give them death and let them pay
The galleys of the underground
Sail on the sea of blood
All that we want crucify your god
The posers on this earth have no right to live
Torture is what we give
Day turns To night 
as I rise from my grave
Black was the hole where I laid
Stalking the city to seek out your blood
I love when it showers from my blade
Your body is so pretty but how will it look
When my perverted lust is stilled
No one to save you no parents or friends
Because they've already got killed
My only aim is to take many lives
The more the better I feel
My only pleasure is to hear many cries
From those tortured by my steel
The colour of your blood from your open body
Is all I wanted to see
Tasting the blood from your lips as you die
Means satisfaction to me
Pleasure to kill
Hear my heartbeat as you see me upon you
Tears in your eyes I do not care
Listen now to the motor of my chainsaw
Open your eyes don't be scared
Look into my eyes do you see any love?
The only thing is agony
Now I can't wait to give you the good pain
Die now and be free
Now that my mission is done
Your body forgotten has been killed
I return to the cemetery
And my bloodlust is filled
My coffin is open for me
I lay down and rest
Nothing will set me free
And so I kill until excess
The cold twilight
Was giving way
To that frozen night
When he started to say
Through you eyes
I can see
None of your lies
Convince me
The dancing shadows
I wait to appear
The omen that shows
You are here
Away from you untrackable
And yet near you untouchable
A sudden fear came into me
The night is here it circles me
A sudden fear
Came into me
The night is here
It circles me
The silver of the moon
So intoxicating
I'll see them soon
It's almost scaring
Undoing hatred
Reflected the gold colours
Golden fire and red
The black of death follows
It's all the same
So dull so plain
I need the spark the flame
To drag me out my insane, of my insane
Only you and me
Face to fate
Come and lead me
To another place
A circle is my mind
A triangle is my soul
I move only behind
I must be reborn as a whole
Only you and me
Face to face
Come and lead me
To another place
Where I can taste
The black of purity
Nothing more
Nothing less
Escape or seek a caress
After dark I feel
I smell the pain
I revive and heal
And this is my gain
It calls me near you
Some cosmic will
I want to hold you
The lust to feel
It's all the same
So dull, so plain
I need the spark, the flame
To drag me out of my insane, of my insane
Like the ocean that roars
Everything I have done
Echoes in my ears
But can never be undone
The battle has offered
The passion and the heat
I can not be denied
Triumph or admit defeat
I remember now
Vigorous I had been
Really cruel but somehow
So glorious no man's ever seen
May we be
The first to know
The first to see
The glory to bow
What else could it be?
The victory I foresaw
I honor the past
I carry the future
I'll make it last
I live up to our culture
In memory of those
Who've crossed my path
I keep them close
In times of death
The battle has offered,
The passion and the heat
I can not be denied, triumph or admit defeat
I remember now vigorous I had been
Really cruel but somehow
So glorious no man's ever seen
The perfect dream I've had
Not long ago
Exciting and yet so sad
What's real? I don't know
Passion for fight
So long desired
Towards twilight
My heart becomes lightened
A whole world
Is revealing itself
This story I've never told
I kept it for myself
It had fallen dark
The winds howled 'round me
I felt the spark
That inspired me
I watch I hesitate
I cry and implore
The power I hate
The power I adore
Sweet melody
Unexpected cold figure
I just want to feel
Pain becomes lust and pleasure
His eyes met mine
Time stood still
My glory will shine
I feel so tranquil
Flesh from my flesh
Natural or unnatural guess?
Even if they harm you
You can't die
You my flesh, you my blood
I see the truth
When you die I'll die
I saw through your eyes
I spoke with your tongue
I name you with my name
Flesh from my flesh
Natural or unnatural guess?
Even if they harm you, you can't die
They can't harm you
They are only clouds
Come with me in a higher sky
Imagine your will and let it be
What is this that comes from you?
The way it comes it makes me tremble like you
Without movement it creeps against us
How does it dare it can't kill us
I never studied with my mistakes
Even when tired I'll do the same
Why did I give you life?
Why did I give you life?
Clouds of guilt gathering
Into a sky of bitterness
Rain of tears comes from walls
I once cursed
Children of the one entranced,
Celebrating so blind
For the desolate feels none
Of his lost glory bat awe
Behold! the serpent's fear,
Forgotten emotion
Since the first fall of tear
Wisdom's failure knowledge
As the tree of life decomposes here
The seventh and the liar,
Underneath the innocence disguise
Fools! you who laid your faith
In prophecies of deliverance
The world made end
never to be spoken
The world made end
cease of immortality
The world made end
a name revealed
The world made end 
empyria drowns
No furious beast shall reign
Before the days of wrath
Wait for no lightbringer
As stars fade away
In the darkness
Of the years that went by
I see through loneliness
Only fear pain and lies
Fear can take my soul
Just like the odor of death
Changes me as a whole
Makes me hold my breath
Sleep the sleep
Of the angels
Let my eyes sweep
This beauty that excels
Delicate silk all memories
Cuts through my brain
Can't see the mysteries
That made me so plain
They can't be seen
They can't be heard
Just like a sin
Always there to hurt
Another day has passed
Another night is here
Eternal end and start
I sense guilt coming near
Uneven fight
Me against my wills
Under moonlight
Remains only my sense
You can break the spell
Tranquil my mind
I had been so blind
Take me in a heavy sleep
In adventures I've never seen
In a dimension before death
Mentally lost always have been
If none of us, return from death
There is so a weaving
To explain life
In a place
There is no life
What I adore
Is lost behind
All the figures feel like me
How can I feel as pain does not exist
Here knowledge meets nothingness
A lost dream, a psychotic feast
If none of us, return from death
There's so weaving
To explain life
In a place
There is no life
What I adore
Is lost behind
I have no advice
How I could
It seems so cordial
But in a way it's not
Delusions
lead my like
Delusions
name all my life
With a picture of an empty heaven
A clear distinction
Between death and joy
I am trying to explore
The mountain of mystery
I envy and adore
The myth and its history
I am in the house of dreams
A different dimension
Nothing is as it seems
An altered direction
I can rest, I can't hide
Wondering if I feel like
Crossing to the other side
Is it different or the same
Yesterday or tomorrow
There is no difference
Joy or sorrow
I have no preference
For the time I wonder
That has long before flown
Am I remiss or a fighter?
I have never known
This is the dead land
This is cactus land
Here the stone images
Are raised, here they receive
The supplication of a dead man's hand
Under the twinkle of a fading star
Is it like this
In death's other kingdom
Waking alone
At the hour when we are
Trembling with tenderness
Lips that would kiss
Form prayers to broken stone
This is the way the world ends
Not with a bang but a whimper
The eyes are not here
There are no eyes here
In this valley of dying stars
In this hollow valley
This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms
Between the idea
And the reality
Between the motion
And the act
Falls the Shadow
For Thine is the Kingdom
Between the conception
And the creation
Between the emotion
And the response
Falls the Shadow
Life is very long
Between the desire
And the spasm
Between the potency
And the existence
Between the essence
And the descent
For Thine is the Kingdom
When you die I hear my name
Try to complete myself again in your eyes in your gold
Everything embraces decay black as sea fool as I
Nothing can reduce the painful of death death as black
When you die, I hear my name cold blood
Try to add and to divide in your eyes black or gold
Everything to learn you hide rubypainruby bride
Try to count how many sins black old seablack or cold
Since I feel good I am clean bloody cold earth comes white
Nothing can reduce the painful of death death as black
When you die, I hear my name cold blood
Be the law art thou as pride, law of blind, law of blind
Truth is what for someone died, blood crawled
Be the form that none will bind
The whole world will be your mind
Keep your search and you will find
To see all or to be blind
Learn to climb the holy stars
Learn to walk the universe
Learn to bless and to reverse
Be the mouth of every curse
Try to complete myself again in your eyes in your gold
Everything embraces decay black as sea fool as I
Nothing can reduce the painful of death death as black
When you die, I hear my name cold blood
Be the law art thou as pride
If it ends tomorrow if it begins
It gives me no sorrow no tears will fall to my lips
I don't know the feeling I haven't felt this before
It is scaring more than I thought more
On my last day I felt alone
For you I pray Your hope will betray you
In the desert land I felt fear
You grabbed my hand I need to be here
If it ends tomorrow if it begins
It gives me no sorrow no tears will fall to my lips
I don't know the feeling I haven't felt this before
It is scaring more than I thought more
So close to me the younger must stay
Nothing more to see nothing more to say
Coming to an end before the night is over
Trying to pretend the time is not over
Emotions hard and rough I am getting old
Is it enough? this isn't the goal
The cure I can find only deep within me
No man can save me no man can help me
Untouched unexpected unfulfilled maybe forever
My soul has been taken away
Undying unreal unconcerned it's now or never
My soul has been taken away
On my last day I felt alone
For you I pray Your hope will betray you
In the desert land I felt fear
You grabbed my hand I need to be here
Total darkness I feel so empty
Death and silence is this remedy?
Undying light frightful laugh
Unspoken might unequal fight
I was fast asleep it was that night
I felt into it so deep then I saw the light
Far beyond this world a whole new lies
The secret I've been told I saw it with my eyes
Dangerous eyes gleamed like fire
Unending lies unfulfilled desire
I had the intent to express my innocence
I am endless I am fearless
Too many answers only one matters
The downfall is imminent, ruthless ignorance
You remind me of times long past
Fear within me grew really fast
I feel so cold inside memory came to me
Matter of pride. 
Anger runs through me
So we have parted unseeing unchanged
Who's defeated? Who eliminated
Dangerous fire burns within me
I am endless I am fearless
The downfall is imminent, ruthless ignorance
My sacred path I follow you
I made on oath I fear and trust you
I have lived for a thousand years
I implore no more full of my own fears
Total darkness I feel so empty
Death and silence is this remedy?
Undying light frightful laugh
Unspoken might unequal fight
After one of my thousand lies, you shall all die
Three thousand years
Waiting to be born
In my mother's womb
Searching for a soul
Silence, a gift of speech
Blindness, eternal vision
Time a trusted friend
God, my son to be born
My eyes have seen spectacular darkness
My ears have heard incredible silence
My mind has thought remarkable nothingness
My truth lies in nothingness... 
nothingness
Trust me, I shall stab you in your back
See me, I have died in the past
Hear me, I scream my silent thoughts
I am the liar
After six thousand years I shall be born
In my mother's womb searching for a soul
Silence a gift of speech blindness eternal vision
Time a trusted friend God my son to be born
Three thousand years
Waiting to be born
In my mother's womb
Searching for a soul
Silence, a gift of speech
Blindness, eternal vision
Time a trusted friend
God, my son to be born
Trust me, I shall stab you in your back
See me, I have died in the past
Hear me, I scream my silent thoughts
I am the liar
Chasing shadows
Before fire
Illusions follow
The ghost of many tears
Once again today
Forever withdrawn
Is this the way
Is this the way
Words never spoken
Truth lives in insanity
Secrets always forgotten
Stand up to your entity
The memory is very deep
I will get through this
Enchanted sleep
Sin becomes an art inside it
Crawling screaming
I stand before doubt
Can't stop shivering
No life is ever lost
This is my comfort
What I like most
What I like most
Is your pure cruelty
I am still afraid of you
My enemy is here
I wish I knew
Is the end near
No life is is ever lost
This is my comfort
What I like most
Is your magic oath
Chasing shadows
Before fire
Illusions follow
The ghost of many tears
Words never spoken
Truth lives in insanity
Secrets always forgotten
Stand up to your entity
The twisted wings and clouds unfold
And the great page of He who feel
Makes arkened shadows over pointed spires
Little children point and sign
And little children run and dance
Over the setting sun
Oh over the setting sun
Lucifer over London
And under that the silent stars
And under that the weeping sky
And under her the laughing world
Balance sits in western parts and piles spare Spares
In his gabled room
Lucifer over London
Great Anarch and Monarch of not
The flight of Lucifer over London
And my little grandson
Wrinkled son forehead
All tiny blue pain
The mother Blood emerges
Then the mother grief
And the blue gates of Death
Open armwide
Open teethwide
Lucifer over London
All dead like the leaves
Old time shiver
Old dead calendar past blurred sunsets cinders flying
In his heart his heart his fingers
Punch holes in the sky
All the little Christs I count
Lucifer over London
All the little Christs I call
Laughing through the green green fields
Some of these angels have the face of God
Some of them the face of dogs
By the tower of Moab
See the sky's green angel form
Lucifer lickers all around me
His hooded eyes alight
Look into him just a little longer
See the true face of the moon
So he weels there through the heavens
His eyes as dotted bright lights
Licked with lust
A golden seabird
Half dead with spray
His banners are broken flags in the wind
Devouring life he breaks at walls
Lucifer over London
The glint of dead fruits glint
And then the moon...
When you are sick I'll be the cure
For your sadness I'll be the laugh
When you cry I'll be the tear
The carmine one so full of fear
When you're down I'll be the wings
That raise you higher and higher
When you're blind I'll see for you
I'll see through me It's strange but true
When you are sick I'll be the cure
For your sadness I'll be the laugh
When you cry I'll be the tear
The carmine one so full of fear
In a way I shall be unbearden your cross
And i a way you'll feel my pleasure
When I touch you my instant fear
When I am you I feel my death is near
When you are cold I'll be the fire
That keeps you warm cremates your dreams
When you sleep I am in your dreams
Within your soul and watch your sin
In a way I shall be unbearden your cross
And i a way you'll feel my pleasure
When I touch you my instant fear
When I am you I feel my death is near
When you're in doubt I'll be with you
I've barely fought since I first saw you
When you're weak I'll give you will
The shelter you seek sound to feel
When you hurt I'll be the pain
The sweet and last that falls with rain
And when you die in your pale hands
I will lurk and I will stand
In a way I shall unbearden your cross
And in a way you'll fell my pleasure
When I touch you my instant fear
When I am you I feel my death is near
Origin of time the face of old flesh
Crumbles the earth my feet and brain
Collapsing into measures of nature's killing liberty
Lights gone an empty house should be filled of empty pain
The cold dark night becomes scary soon
In the light of a young moon
A thorn in my soul your face fade away
Awake like an owl for salvation I pray
And shining flames burning the night sky
Until you who walk among the living
Touch the overbearing fall on the crushed
In the light of a young moon
The cold dark night becomes scary soon
A thorn in my soul your face fade away
Awake like an owl for salvation I pray
He who sleeps in the embrace of not
Shall carry the thorns of carrion souls
He who rules the flesh of the pigs
With an oral smile shall pray on fools
Tough the overweening fall on the crushed
Blind eyes of old light pigs shall rule
The flesh of kings devoured for six nights
The sky is empty set a golden snake crumbles the earth
Her feet and brain the face of old flesh
Like an empty light house hiding the cold flesh
Snow is falling through the living is gone
Then the memory of old fear is upon
Rushes sordid through winged black images
Who shall build an empty sky
Same as the origin of your face
Origin of time origin of time
I am the one that lead you
I am the one that hurt you
I am the one that breaks you
Inside your brain
I am the one that crushed you
I am the one that rapes you
I am the one that conquers you
Inside your brain
I am the curse that hunt you
Before the death abandons you
Before your life start to fall
I am the curse you ever wish to throw
So o not cry and obey me
I as the fate am here to stay
To crush to rape to break you
I am the curse that abandons you
I am the sin that opposes you
I am the one that delights you
I am the one that calms you
I am the one that excites you
Inside your brain
I am the fate that leads you
To the eternal valley of pleasure
You desire me I know that
But you will never get me just for that
So cry and obey me
I as the fate am here to stay
To lead to calm to win you
I am the curse that abandons you
I am the sin that opposes you
I am the curse that hunt you
Before the death abandons you
Before your life start to fall
I am the curse you ever wish to throw
I am the sin that opposes you
Crush. 
Rape. 
Conquer you
Break. 
Hunt. 
Oppose you
Kill. 
Destroy. 
Obsess you
Kill. 
Destroy. 
Oppose you
Time stands still
Like a sad young boy
Staring the ground
Making no sound
Time stands still
He refuses to walk
Talking through the lie
Just trying to die
Time stands still
But why move
When I am not warm
until I taste blood
Time stands still
Like a small blond girl
Just playing dead
Her throat is red
Time the eternal meaning of pain
the only creature to stay
Silent emperor in my dreams
take my soul and strip it
Time stands still
Holding his breath
Begging for a death
But she is deaf
Time stands still
He can wait as I
Kill time and feel
Until you spill still
Time stands still
Like I wait for you
Like you are here
When dawn is near
Time stands still
Has embraced my life
Living in the ground
Doesn't make a sound
Time stands still
But why move
When you are not cold
Yet to unfold from a pill
Time stands still
And he knows I will
Wait till you you're shown
For the perfect dawn you feel
Silent emperor in my dreams
Time stands still
Like a sad young boy
Staring the ground
Making no sound or a kill
Time stands still
He refuses to walk
Talking through the lie
Just trying to die he will
Time stands still
But why move
When I am not warm
until I taste blood from a kill
Time stands still
Like a small blond girl
Just playing dead
Her throat is red but she feels
Silent emperor in my dreams
Time stands still
Holding his breath
Begging for a death
But she is deaf and real
Time stands still
He can wait as I
Kill time and feel
Until you spill your thrill
Silent emperor in my dreams
I was straight asleep it was that night
I felt into it so deep then I saw this light
You've been there I can only tell
Suddenly scare your fear I smell
Past dressed in blue blue of silence
I wish I knew the depth of ignorance
The wind was whistling a great new song
I started wondering saw before long
I sank into darkness no strength left in me
I found nakedness nothing else to see
The glory of sadness death for death
The arrow of madness the target is myself
Vague thoughts torture my head you raise your veil you raise your name
Always fight never fear cold dark night the battle is near
I sensed danger caught in a trap it took an instant the struggle was sharp
I remember what you had said the challenger will prevail
I was straight asleep it was that night
I felt into it so deep then I saw this light
Far beyond this world a new one lies
A seret I've been told I saw it with my eyes
You've been there I can only tell
Suddenly scare your fear I smell
Past dressed in blue, blue of silence
I wish I knew the depth of ignorance
Draw deeply thy breath
Close thy mouth with right fore finger pressed
Dash down the hand with a great sweep
Expelling forcibly thy breath
Soul with virtues and minus
Emotions that battle with love and hate
Body with instinct and insanity
Sensation of pleasure mixed with pain
Feel the crude natural power
Give birth to what I had dig lower
Evoke the source of creation
Control the power of salvation
Lay down to the powers of universe
Internalize the harmony of universe
Destroy the naive paths of ignorance
Control the inner cries of desperation of vitiation
The purely major
The purely minor
Sign of expansion
Sign of paradox
Touch the joy of the absolute
Wear the mask of fighting rule
Swear the oath of macro
Turn the chapter of micro
Chase the inner freedom
Forbidden paths of liberation
Follow the voices the crush your mind
Beyond the unseen cries of a wasted life
The purely major
Hate for hate and ruth for ruth
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth
Scorn for scorn and smite for smite
Love for love and guile for guile
He who is without sin
He who mantles passion with fear
He who turns the other cheek
He who drowns wrath with fire
War for war and woe for woe
Blood for blood and blow for blow
Scorn for scorn and smite for smite
Love for love and guile for guile
He who to evil resist
He who creates wraith from clay
He who declaims never to judge
He who divides seas and skies
He who reveals love as an arm
He who creates shields by fire
He who serves slaves and faints
He who builds walls with tears
Fire and tears enlighten my world
This world dressed in fear
Awe the emotions of wrath
Behold the serpent's fear
He who to evil resist
He who creates wraith from clay
He who declaims never to judge
He who divides seas and skies
He who reveals love as an arm
He who creates shields by fire
He who serves slaves and faints
He who builds walls with tears
Hate for hate and ruth for ruth
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth
Scorn for scorn and smite for smite
Love for love and guile for guile
War for war and woe for woe
Blood for blood and blow for blow
Scorn for scorn and smite for smite
Love for love and guile for guile
Here stays enthroned the one that breathes the night
The blood ruler of great fights
Here stays enthroned the virgin of ten thousand sins
The virgin whose beauty dreams all light
She is the one who walks on semi-dead souls
She is the one that her love is lethal sweet
She is the one that owns the fate of clever fools
She is the one whose smile means your defeat
Behold her name the threefold breath
The veil under her eyes portends only death
Her breast is venomous, her kiss rebirths
Go further and further close to the death
Be wise to time, be strong to hold
Her pleasure for the gods, orison for the souls
Her joy is earth, the color of gold
Her absence is named cold
The lady from the end of all life
Her power is the world, her fear is the life
Behold thyself do not make her your wife
Your soul belongs to her, to her knife
Fear not her lethal eternal grip
Her loss does not make you weak, keeps you strict
A demon is for you, for you to keep
Her ecstasy on your feet
The one that breathes the night
Blood ruler of great fights
Virgin of thousand sins
Her beauty dims all light
She walks on semi-dead souls
Her love is lethal sweet
She owns the fate of clever fools
Her smile is your defeat
Ice in her eyes-soil in her soul
Hard in her heart-harm in her arm
Death in her breath-pain in her name
She is inside
deep in your life
Miss you side
take my harm
Breathe my heart
in your side
We are in her
we must now hide
She is inside
deep in your life
Behold her name the threefold breath
The veil under her eyes portends only death
Her breast is venomous, her kiss rebirths
Go further and further close to the death
Be wise to time, be strong to hold
Her pleasure for the gods, orison for the souls
Her joy is earth, the color of gold
Her absence is named cold
Beyond inconceivable agony, 
to the dark tunnel of pain
I here your voice flickering, 
into the silent drop of rain
I here your cry of despair, 
the expectancy of escape
Please help me, help me, 
help me, get me out of here
My words have been lost, 
my fright has brought
The unexpected, 
vision that shakes me
My limbs have frozen, 
my hearts beats so strong
Am I dreaming? 
How real the feeling?
Beyond the wall of truth I here myself crying
Searching for a exit on a foggy side of life
I need to find the line, 
I am forced to touch the sign
Where das salvation dwell?
My soul praises the light, 
surrounded by the night
My wishes perished, 
all hopes vanished
My body fades away, 
illusions painted in gray
Am I living or am I dreaming
Beyond the wall of truth I here myself crying
Searching for a exit on a foggy side of life
I need to find the line, 
I am forced to touch the sign
Before the dawn I am buried
Into the tunnel of death
I here your voice that begs
For an exit to escape
Before the dawn I am buried
Feeling so dull so plain
Your fate starts to fade
It's time to face the flame
It's time to face the flame
It's time to face your dream drowned in pain
I stare and then stare again
There is no place just counting days
My hopes have been lost, 
my heart beats so strong
I am not dreaming, 
true is the feeling
Counting the time
so alone, expecting the inevitable
Shredding my wishes scatter my feelings
Beyond the wall of truth I here myself crying
Searching for a exit on a foggy side of life
I need to find the line, 
I am forced to touch the sign
Before the dawn I am buried
Into the tunnel of death
I here your voice that begs
For an exit to escape
Before the dawn I am buried
Feeling so dull so plain
Your fate starts to fade
It's time to face the flame
Vital existence to those who claim indulgence
Being captured to the wasted bright of displeasure
Cordial existence to those who refuse abstinence
Trapped in the swinging hope of eternal pleasure
Unsullied wisdom to those who strikes the ingrates
Relieved from the pipedreams of a decadent power
Fulfilled desire for those who accomplish their sins
Escaping from the naked side of expurgation
They want you dead, 
your unsullied wisdom a lambent flame
They want the sigh of your existence, 
the star of sustenance
They want you alive, 
prophet and slave of the glorious one
They want you secret your fainting will for eminence
The shadow of the omnipresent, 
feed to your indulgence
Feed to your abstinence, 
feed to your ignorance
OBLIVION DECAY AND DEATH
Three of my children without birth
Vital existence to those who claim indulgence
Being captured to the wasted bright of displeasure
Cordial existence to those who refuse abstinence
Trapped in the swinging hope of eternal pleasure
Unsullied wisdom to those who strikes the ingrates
Relieved from the pipedreams of a decadent power
Fulfilled desire for those who accomplish their sins
Escaping from the naked side of expurgation
I am trapped within a fabled dream
The one that hunts at the edge of horror
What do I love there is no form no being
To witch I do not give my self alone
Awake from dreaming the truth is the known
Awake from waking the truth is unknown
Show me the dream that leads me to trueness
Show me the truth that releases me from madness
Awake from dreaming, awake from waking
Show me the dream that leads me to the truth
Show me the truth that wakes me from the nightmare
I am trapped within an unending line
The one that hurts the value of hollow
What is the sign, what is the omen?
To witch I have to base upon
The truth that dwells in the dark night of soul
Beware of every herald of the dawn
Find me the soul that truth doesn't dwell in darkness
Find me the herald to proclaim me the sadness
Find me the silence the light side of truth
Fill me with hopes with reasons with wisdom
Awake me from dreaming that truth is the known
Awake me from waking truth is unknown: 
the fear is the known
Law reason time space blind us to truth
All that we know is that we know not
Law reason time space blind us to truth
All that we know is that we know not
The truth that dwells in the dark night of soul
Beware of every herald of the dawn
Find me the soul that truth doesn't dwell in darkness
Find me the herald to proclaim me the sadness
Find me the silence the light side of truth
Fill me with hopes with reasons with wisdom
Awake me from dreaming that truth is the known
Awake me from waking truth is unknown
Skies who dwell into the aethyrs
Are all powerful into the earth
They execute the crisis of him
They serve the will they follow the will of them
Here is the face of your god
Rule of the blessing lord of the skies
Reign the earth with power of respect
Reign the earth agreed with his wish
Let the earth be reigned from its parts
Let the vision rise its glory up
In its route in route with the skies
And as servant let them serve without lies
Ohh you skies raise upon
Inferior skies lower skies
Command the ruling command the forceful
Destroy those who fall those who go down
Creatures of earth or man let outrage
The one another with darkness
Opus of mankind let extinct
Its creation cares for beasts
The call of the thirty aethyrs
Born with those that compound
The call of the thirty aethyrs
Destroy all those branded around
The call of the thirty aethyrs
Let no land remain the same as was found
The call of the thirty aethyrs
Add and withdraw till only stones you count
Born with those that compound
Destroy all those branded around
Let no land remain the same as was found
Add and withdraw till only stones you count
Move and appear in front of his words
For that swore with us to his justice
Make us mystics to the knowledge of procreation
Crowned in a land of abomination
Let the earth be familiar be strange
Let the earth be the locus of pain
Let the earth be the cradle of the whore
Let the earth be the place of those who fall
All I have dies by days
All I want has your face
All I see has your name
All I love dies in pain
All I aim is for you
Entire afflictions is sad but true
All I tell you is the truth
Dying off a way to ensure
All I dream is fading
All I dream off does fade
All I love hides away
All I live for makes me die
All I feel truth of lies
All I own lost too fast
Hyaline dreams that all disappeared like dust
All I touch begins to rust
Creaky castles in the sand
All I will my will knot
All I live with will rot
All I knew leaves my brain
All I aim dies again
Broken dreams that fades away
Like muddy footsteps in the rain
Dusty hopes frozen lies
Reveal the end so lost behind
Silent screams that wipe away
Seeking life in my brain
Broken hopes unending lies
Reveal from fog the rusty life
All I have dies by days
All I want has your face
All I see has your name
All I love dies in pain
All I aim is for you
All I tell you is the truth
All I dream off does fade
All I love hides away
All I love makes me die
Like deep blue painting in the twilight
All I touch tern to dust
Creaky castles in the sand
All I own lost too fast
Hyaline dreams disappeared to dust
All I live with will rot
Forbidden lust to be reborn
I am the healer and the deceiver
I am the sober eye of fate
I always take to be the giver
I am the crimson eye of hate
My love is sloth corrupting order
I am the secret hand of pain
I am the builder of this wanderland
My face is known by the insane
My work is black the sin moves
As horrific and as cold
I am the horns with golden hooves
The balance of the gods
Oblivion decay and death
Three of my children without birth
I am into the inner dark
The tension of the kill
The first of murders had my mark
I am in restricted thrills
My work is black the sin moves
As horrific and as cold
I am the horns with golden hooves
The balance of the gods
Not being me, yet I am life
The lover and the wife
In nothing I am the essence all, 
the things in which you exist
Still I am more you couldn't hold, 
the corpse's biggest feast
My work is black the sin moves as horrific and as cold
I am the horns with golden hooves, 
the balance of the god
Staring at me is a simple thing
But may affect you a lot
I am inside you in every thing
GOD'S OWN ETERNAL HOST
I am the healer and the deceiver
I am the sober eye of fate
I always take to be the giver
I am the crimson eye of hate
My love is sloth corrupting order
I am the secret hand of pain
I am the builder of this wanderland
My face is known by the insane
My work is black the sin moves
As horrific and as cold
I am the horns with golden hooves
The balance of the gods
I am the burning side of rules
The balance of the gods
I saw the full face of the menstrual Hecate
Four and forty virgins make the form of the gate
It is the key inside me, 
it is the glyph of the vision
To have a god within, 
under the name of legion
Love of night manifests infinitely eternally
Love of darkness signifies the enlightened life eternally
Into the divine water, deviation fulfilled
Wisdom is clear, 
all logic is killed
By the ancient way I project my soul
The task was given it is the death of all
My son has offered blood, 
his mother her tears
Full of joy they mingle, 
to feed the fear
Behold the moon is crowned, 
I raise thy sign
For the lord destruction is always blind
By bliss of pain I move the spirit
Into oblivion calls I will never hear it
An ancient voice calling from the mouth of hell
Beyond this passage there lies hole for my sell
I found him waiting in the name of dirt
Illusion's face my weakness is his strength
1000 daughters bind the runners of pain
Oh be merciful magic with the corpse of my brain
His tongue is nailed with the spikes of Christ
Divides the unity calls death for a life
Laughs at the ground that keeps the realm gold
Another still life for me to love for me to grow
Another life for me to love for me to grow in sadness
It is the key inside me to have a god within in the name of madness
Rise up the strength on them
In the name of a fruitful land
In the name of a bright path
Trodden with ignorant steps
Warble out in my cradle's edge
In the name of a future calm
In the name of a pure light
Marching with a bright shade
Conquering the entire range
He who graces himself a joy
Fell the grief he may destroy
An unending glorious lie
Harm the power and defile
Rise up the horns of sin
The caves of the cursed I have seen
Where mortals' souls covered with the temple of sin
The strength of demons I feel
Ceaseless passion to restrict
And wicked angels surround me
Burning me with their fiery wings
Who shall dare to join them in
To stain his soul with the aura of grey
And when the flame of wings remain
Seeking the golden fountain
Oh God chase me
Oh God save me
Who shall sink them to the bed
Painting the sea with the colour of red
And when the flame of wings remain
Seeking for golden fountain
Oh God chase me
Oh God save me
Who shall dare to join them in
To stain his soul with the aura of grey
And when the flame of wings remain
Seeking the golden fountain
Who shall sink them to the bed
Painting the sea with the colour of red
And when the flame of wings remain
Seeking the golden fountain
And when the bells of fate sound
Digging your soul deep into the ground
Setting your sense to the bound
Spreading your eminence all around
And when the bells of fate sound
You walk in pathless ways till the dawn
Screaming for salvation so loud
Spreading your indulgence all around
And when the bells of fate sound
Then you immortals stand up and shout
Then you blessed martyrs doubt
Here comes a new age's blow
Slaves of fate instigate
And feel your sword's blazing edge
Your section to the enemy
Wound for the sleepy age
Slaves of fate instigate
And feel your sword's blazing edge
Your section to the enemy
Wound for the sleepy age
Space trap the time
Mind owes the world
The perfect twin for your spatial globe
I am your parallel existence
The fate 
The wrong
The extremely forbidden thought
Wander just beside my face
Travel in my desired expanse
Detect the omen that are said
But still I search you 
Still I hope in you
Roaming in a distinct space
Walk upon my errant's shades
Laugh upon my wretched race
But still I search you 
Still I hope in you
Stride on the other space
Live on another sense
Melt on a different earth
But still feel you 
As I left you
Running deep back in past time
Tangle into spatial time
Limit up my mental sign
But still I search you 
When I face
Travel in my desired expanse
Detect the omen that are said
But still I search you 
Still I hope in you
Roaming in a distinct space
Walk upon my errant's shades
Laugh upon my wretched race
But still I search you 
Still I hope in
my parallel life
Ages back but still besides
Trapped in a spoiled spatial hollow
Break me down with your shining bright smile
When I'll find you I can't forgive you
When I'll find you I can't excuse you
When I'll find you I will beg you
And my life back I will claim from you

I will die for a host in Heaven
It will give to my sins a shelter

Feel your sense that burns
Serve in Heaven or rule in Hell
Serve your instincts or reveal the sense
Inhale the fear or spit the distress
Blind on tear or behold the revenge
See your soul that melts
Enlight your soul with fakes
Foggy hopes so gray
Believe your senseless pain
Rise up the lambent flame
Feed your ignored will
Being ingratiate
Name the soul's existence
As a son without birth
As a son without birth
As a flame without blaze
Name your soul's
Existence as a dead that is awake
As a leaf that dying drained
As a dream that fades away
Serve in Heaven
Or rule in Hell
Feel your sense that burns
God desires to be born
In the flame of human sense
Bursting and rising
Higher and higher
And what if there are no roots on earth
And what if the stoned residence
Is a ruined hotel
Where the flame of God cannot burn
And what if the human sense
Appears as a son without birth
On an unequal battle
Where the stoned walls are made of human flesh
God desires to reign
In the flame of human fear
Creating and burning
The fields of humans' fear
prepare your soul for the eternal burn
and what if the human sense is a son without birth
Idealism, Materialism, Skepticism, Pragmatism
Electism, Fideism, Immortality of the rational soul
Free inquiry for the one that is the flame of life
Pure power to the spark that keeps the fire bright
Offspring of evidence ambiguity of reason
Reasons for what had happened but have no reason
Idealism, Materialism, Skepticism, Pragmatism
Electism, Fideism, Independence of sense, Perception
Onus for the existent, inheritance of a different purpose
Release of a man's estate tranquility on that cosmos
Setting the minds on the bright prospects
Awe the emotions of a luminous project
Reveal of nature becomes apparent
God proves with his act the existence of madness
Offspring of evidence ambiguity of reason
Reasons for what had happened but have no reason
Lawless wings of doctrine
I revive and search
Lawless wings of doctrine
I imagine, break all chains
Lawless wings of doctrine
I squatter and I confess
Lawless wings of doctrine
I produce and I create
Is this the holy thing to see?
Is this the land that sun shines
Above the Heaven?
Hear those children's desperate cries:
Oh, children do they cry?
Do they hear their fathers' sigh?
Is this the fertile place to be?
Is this the land that sprouts
Green reach gardens?
Hear those souls' flickering cries!
Do they beg?
Do they smile?
Do they frame the long line?
Here shines the sun of a lower God
Here burns the bright torch of soul
Here reigns thy mighty crown of horns
Well blossomed is his existence
So unwilling in their souls to see
So weak to face him from
The outcast angle of earth
So rapid do they flee
When bells of order are echoed
Nemesis for the anxious heavy spirit
Nemesis for a generation free
Here shines the sun of a lower God
Here is born the light for the blind world
Against on what prophets wrote
Will reign, will prevail,
Tranquillize the human race
Here burns thy bright torch of soul
Here reigns thy mighty crown of horns
Against on what prophets wrote
Will reign, will prevail and
Tranquillize the human race
Here burns the bright torch of soul
Here reigns thy mighty crown of horns
Against on what prophets wrote
Will reign, will prevail and
Tranquillize the human race

And feel the breeze as frozen pale
And when the dews of night arise
Wet their souls with holy lies
THUNDEROUS UPRISING

NEMESIS LAST BUST LAST
BUST THE HOLY RITE
Is this the land where sun brightly shines
is this the existence of a heaven's sign
Is this the locus the hallowed focus
where grace love and harmony combine
Is this the stead where reigns the light
is this where hate bids
Hear those souls' cries do they beg do they smile
do they follow the endless long line
NEMESIS FOR THE ANXIOUS HEAVY
SPIRIT
Lay down their souls with holy fears
and waters the ground with dismal tears
Soldiers of grief prepare we are near
fight the pash with shields but without spears
Hold by the whispers that summer breeze bears
and reign the land where all the woes bear
Hear those souls' cries do they beg do they smile
do they follow the endless long line
NEMESIS FOR THE GENERATION FREE
When on high the heaven, had not be named
Firm ground below was unnamed
When on high the heaven, had not be named
Firm ground below was unnamed
Mummu Tiamat she who bore them
And the earth has been done and the life has just begun
and the formless void and darkness outdone
And the water has been done and the sky raised up
separating the water the genesis goes on
And the greater light has been done and the lesser light spun
to rule the day and night together with the stars
And the living creatures has been done
and the sea monsters have born
and everything that moves with which the waters swarm
She made the Worm the Dragon
The Female Monster the Great Lion
The Mad Dog the Man Scorpion
The Howling Storm
And the greater light has been done
and the lesser light spun
to rule the day and night
together with the stars
Hey little kid come here, believe in us and be like us
Taste the sapor of the forbidden seed
Drown the awe breath, far in your azure deeps
Fear ain't your foe but you're ally to meet your dream
Show me your bound to show you the heart
To outdo your awe and brave become
Drown the awe in your azure deeps
Fear isn't your foe but you're ally to win
Whisper the reason that doubt yourself
To trace the path of braveness and strength
Bury the awe in your nightmare's shelf
Nothing to fear but fear itself
Show me your bound to show you the heart
To outdo your awe and brave become
Drown the awe in your azure deeps
Fear ain't your foe but your ally to win
Phobos has just be born and sent to mortal's world
To kill human's immortality hope
Phobos has just be born the hidden awe of god
The awe for freedom and his throne loss
You people have done everything in the world to me.
Doesn't that give me equal right?
I can do anything I want to you people at any time I want to, 
because that's what you've done to me.
If you spit in my face and smack me in the mouth 
and throw me in solitary confinement for nothing, 
what do you think is gonna happen when I get outta here?
Earth, uterus of stars and sky
Mother of the highlands
Womb of ocean and arid sea
Let your seed create the barrows
Gods' dweeling so hallowed
And chain and gain the reign
Let your seed create the Cyclops
Monsters one eyed so robust
That crash and strike create
And offer this good to human race
For power and glory to gain
And offer this good to human race
For defiance and pride to strain
To dele and vanguish the sorrow
fullfill their vision to reign
Upon god's dweeling the hallowed
their existence to gain
Long ago you broke off your joke and tore off your bonds
You said I will not serve 
indeed on every high hill
And under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute
I form the light and create darkness
I bring prosperty and create disaster
I THE LORD
I THE GOD
I form the light and create darkness
I make weal and create sadness
I THE LORD
I THE HORNED
When the night of love draws to its close
The red mist rises to greet the dawn
Covering the lord of those who do not dare to be
The sign of evil is here to feel
I form life and create fire
I promise peace and create pyre
I THE LORD
I THE GOD
I form life and create fire
I bring delight and bear desire
I THE LORD
I THE HORNED
In the sleepy night
From a breezy bite
Oh earth
your son born
the sky
The tireless shield of mankind
Wake! under a sun that scatters its shine
And praise the stars from the field of the night
Words full of faith that sound so bright
Scattered in ether but they are surmrised
Teached how to kill your blaze inside
Preached how to leave the fear beside
You infernal soul reveal the wise
How the beauty borns from inside
BORN FROM INSIDE and burn the Angel
SPAWN PROCREATE and kill the menial
Faint the light that comes from the blaze
That crush and raze all of your bowels
BORN FROM INSIDE and burn the Angel
SPAWN PROCREATE and kill the menial
Seed the thorn that bears the flame
That burns inside you and willing to frame
Oh tireless shield of mankind
The thorn of death so much chars me
That my spark returned to you
And fire the stars that light the way to you
I am the titan ruler of the earth
lord of upper and under cosmos
I govern the weakness
in every cry of every man
I am the Cronus offspiring of earth and chaos
I teach you the art of war far in your sleepy subconscious
And hype up the will of vengeance
And draw down to earth by spells and wickedness
The joyful color is for me
What does paint your soul with weaknesses
And break up your sacredness
And bless the impure with joy and rawness
Supreme victim is for me
What is haunt with tear and prayer
I am the Cronus offspiring of earth and chaos
I teach you the art of war far in your sleepy subconscious
I weep your weakness fluid that you are calling tear
And face the Angel that dread to dare
And crush the tyrants iron head
And become a tyrant in his stead
Supreme power is for me
What it flows from anger
And look down on and snigger
The apathy of mind and bring them
The art of blowing up the teen
and be the fortune's stringer
The frozen wind I feared, 
a song of laugh and tear
My single son was singing the beauty of this living
A lament cleaved the air, 
the sole request of bier
My single son was crying, 
life was too short to satisfy
He sang and he was fighting with bevy of crow that eagerly
Waiting his flesh to eat, 
thirsty his blood to drink
Hit with his heavy hand the ground so hard
The earth that growed him, 
this earth will bury him
Earth in your ground I lived my first exile
Earth your ground watered with my bile
Earth your ground marked with my sign
And you erased it with my dying
Boatman accept the coin of my son and lead him to the other bank
And send my damn to the time, 
that Charon decided to take the son of mine
Earth in your ground I lived my first exile
Earth your ground watered with my bile
Earth your ground marked with my sign
And you erased it with my dying
Rage and fight
March and fright
And now that dawn breaks
Behind the eyes
And its lightness delivered
By the screams
Just feeling my face frozen
Just seeing my life chosen by
Arm and strike
Arch and ride
And now that painted crows
Laugh in the shade
Spreading their screams
In the valley of death
Just feeling my heart trembling
The time has come to
Rage and fight
March and fright
Arm and strike
Arch and ride
Let there be my dreadful dream
Rage and fire
Let there be my dreadful dream
Rage and fire
Let there sound my wicked screams
Fear afire
Won by our fathers soldiers
Won with offerings and blood
Blaze in each countenance
Spring thresh and fire the battle
Let liberty reign
Let's fight for freedom
Everyone here has the right for
Freedom, everyone can step the arduous path of wisdom
Let clarity done
A clarity clad by wisdom
Are you ready to fight for freedom?
Are you ready to die for peace?
I eye the grizzle cloud of rain
No certitude, no peace, mo help for pain
Behold, the anger here reigns
I am here as on a darkling plain
Let liberty reign
Let's fight for freedom
Hey soldier, wake up and hear
The infant groan the infant fear
My sweat wallows and I only pray
I only wail the wrong of death's delay
Let clarity done
A clarity clad by wisdom
Won by our fathers soldiers
Won with offerings and blood
Crush
Kill
Spring thresh and fire the battle
Woe, pain, blood lead us
Now that we end up with fire
Some strident curses come from higher
Woe, pain, blood lead us
We are the nights' atrocious sons
We come from strange locus named Neverland
Atrocious demons' feed you will become
A woeful shadow without blood
Show me the path to show you the land
Where grimy war and pain have just begun
Oh, you strain, oh, you pain
I am thine and thou art mine
Now that the order sounds cease-fire
Some warlike voices sound like choir
Woe, pain, blood lead us
And tear the lucid and silky veil of my dream
And walk on gloomy and trodden path and kill
My misty brain, lord, please reign
Lord please reign and spit the poison in my vein
I am thine and thou art mine
Paint death with colour night
Scream loud your feeling fright
Hear the mercy yell fight
Unchain the beast inside and bite
Face the underworld
This twisted and naked world
Where screams sing the song
The song of the netherworld
We are the fears
We are always near
We are the fears that feed our souls
With frozen tears
We are the fears
We sound clear
We are the fears that nail your soul with our spears
Weep for me, for you, for thee
Pray in your distress to die
Lay down, obey, vile
Face the enemy and fight
Welcome to our world
To gloomy and dusky world
Where sins sing our song
The song of the netherworld
We are the fears
We are always near
We are the fears that feed our souls with frozen tears
We are the fears
We spare your ears
We are the fears that nail your soul with our spears
Dark covered era, behold eternal
Beware the quite torment that last eternal
Bloodstained era that last eternal
Fire... 
Fire...
Dark covered era
Bloodstained era that last eternal
Fire... 
Fire...
Will I ever find out the sour of fear
The sour of scare
And walk on the entire range of being
Far of being near
I came here for breezy blood to step on
A hill of soil and mud
I walked till here to feel my spear
I obey my lordly prime, I sharpen my
Steel to sharpen my fear
And breaking my awe's chain,
My sparkly view their dread will rare
Back to the battle where fate calls
And the smell of death slyly crawls
I sailed till here to drown my fear
Darkness, dread and tear
Make each sense of death to seem so far so near
Fire, death and fear
I dry me wetly dreams on shields and spears
Darkness, dread and tear
Fire, death and fear
In the age of gold we sculpt with deads
In the age of liberty the dread is reigning
In the age of wealth we waste flames
But the flames are known to our dead
Abomination, humiliation,
God cursed creation
Why you cage our souls
To your kingdom
Illumination, desire, salvation,
You exiled creation
Let me walk the path of wisdom
The dead are counting
With their names
The dread is following up with shames
The blood is spooking the place
But this place is not new to our dead
The dead are counting
With their names
The dread is following up with shames
The blood is spooking the place
But this place is not new to our dead
Abomination, humiliation
Abomination, abomination, humiliation
Let me walk the path of wisdom
Thou on the cross, for you shall fight
Dead arch dead march embattle and fire
Thou on the cross, for you shall fight
Thou on the cross, for you shall die
Thou on the cross, for you shall fight
Thou on the cross, for you shall die
Soldiers be prepared, prepared!
Fight for our cause
Embattle cruel to waste your soul,
Our cause is heaven's cause
Soldiers be prepared, prepared!
Die for an absurd law
Sharp your arm that sharp your heart,
Be worth of our cause
For a voice like thunder and a tongue
To drown the throat of war
When the senses are shaken
And the soul is driven to madness
Who can stand, who can stand
When the souls are torn
To everlasting fire
For a scream like rumble and a tongue
That spit the curse of war
When the senses are ablazed and the
Soul lead the flames
Who can stand, who can stand
Thou on the cross, for you shall fight
Dead arch dead march
Embattle and fire
Now I see the light
Light me a light, any kind of light
Will I ever see this green green
Landscape bright
Will I ever feel this spring
Breeze and delight
Now I see the light, now I see the light

Then a dubious being and weak am I
Without caring if I live or f I die
Mortals face your holy dream tonight
The sky, the earth, the sea belongs to thee...

Welcome to my dark kingdom
Behind the sun
To breathe to win your freedom
You are being trialed hard
The flames the blazes the fire the dazzling blasts
The freaks the bats the razors, thirsty for your blood
The wolves the hungry jaguars the evil laugh
They only want to kill you they want your life
How deep you hide your fear how aweless you are
Do you baptize your spear in torrid blood
Can you detain your tear, the pulse of heart
Welcome to my dark kingdom behind the sun
Bring me my sword 
the awe of the altar's law
Let the blood flow
in the valley of infernal woe
Leave pain shows
thy might of my underworld
Let blade dawn
their path to the netherworld
I sharpen my sword
the symbol of my obscure world
Praise me as a god
as the ruler of your scared world
Look at the crown
and declare your desired word
Let the blood flow
let it flow let it blow
Phobia the hidden life's emotion
The cursed the exiled shadow
The seed of sorrow
Gloria to those that show devotion
And a divine honor
the holy bread to swallow
Phobia the visible life's diversion
A fairy tale that hallow
Your soul your sorrow
Gloria for brave and strong warrior
With a command to follow
The curse to hallow
And I conjure you, with the pins of pain I sting you
Dark spells I send you, the antigod I name you
Rada there is no death there is...
Fire that feeds your life's desire
I exorcise you, with the holy fluid I wet you
And then I capture you in my witchy world I jail you
Liar you sentence me to burn in...
Fire, fake tales strong chains that lift you
Higher and then you blow out the...
Fire that feeds your life's desire
In the land where no sun rises up
I assault with no thoughts to turn back
I will battle till the dawn faint the sun
Death, my friend I will not be outdone
I swear in the name of Ishtar
I summon you in the realm of Nergal
I will fight till all dead will stand up
I am Gilgamesh the demigod
I am Gilgamesh the demigod
The unbowed the strong of this world
I have built for you the walls of Uruk
Gilgamesh semigod glorious son of God
I am Gilgamesh the son of God
I am feeding my soul with your blood
I will fight till the dusk of dawn
Gilgamesh semigod glorious son of God
Look at me, I am dancing,
Hear me, I am singing
Come here darling, Mesmerized.
Rusalka spirit wrathful
Rusalka ghost unfaithful
When you hear me when you see me
Then your life has no meaning
Is it a laugh or is it a cry
Is a swan's song, hear and die
Rusalka demon naked
Rusalka wood nymph unwedded
In river's bottom she will take you
And forever there she will keep you
Rusalka spirit wrathful
Rusalka ghost unfaithful
When you hear me when you see me
Then your life has no meaning
Look at me I am dancing
Hear me I am singing
Come here darling
Death is what you feel
Love and hate
Lust and pain
Love is Pain
War and pain
Life and chain
Life is Pain
Free and slave
Whip and reign
Free is Slave
Sin and faith
Desire and flame
Sin is Flame
Love and hate
Lust and pain
Love is Pain
War and pain
Life and chain
Life is Pain
Welcome to hell
Welcome to underworld
Obey my name
This is your scary world
Don't fear the night's uprising
The anger of the Gods
Don't fight the wick with yearning
A battle that I have won
Welcome to hell
Welcome to my dark world
See how the flame
Burn your ultimate hope
All I see now
death and life
All I hearn now
Prays and lies
All i feel now
Wrath and spite
I swear to the gods
To kill and die
Welcome to hell
Welcome to underworld
Obey my name
This is your scary world
Oh for a voice like thunder, and a tongue
To drown the throat of war! 
When the senses Are shaken, 
and the soul is driven to madness, Who can stand? 
When the souls of the oppressed
Fight in the troubled air that rages, who can stand?
When the whirlwind of fury comes from the Throne of God, 
when the frowns of His countenance
Drive the nations together, who can stand?
When Sin claps his broad wings over the battle,
And sails rejoicing in the flood of death;
When souls are torn to everlasting fire,
And fiends of hell rejoice upon the slain,
Oh who can stand? Oh who hath caused this?
Oh who can answer at the throne of God?
The Kings and Nobles of the land have done it!
Hear it not, Heaven, 
thy ministers have done it!
Devotion secrecy and strength
The call of chaplain is clear and brave
This ritual will be a mystery and strange
From the untrodden paths of mystery and strange
We heard the darkness grapple with the night
We hear the whispers of wisdom and fate
We hear the oaths of mystery and brave
The call of chaplain is clear and brave
And when the lamb
opened the first seal,
I saw the first Horse.
The Horseman held a bow.
Now when the lamb
opened the second seal,
I saw the second Horse.
The Horseman held a sword.
The leading Horse is white,
the second Horse is red,
the third one is a black,
the last one is a green.
And when the lamb
opened the third seal,
I saw the third Horse.
The Horseman had a balance.
Now when the lamb
opened the fourth seal,
I saw the fourth Horse.
The Horseman was the Pest.
I saw the lightness
The point of no the return
I Felt the power
The call of silente death
I face the silence
The awe of the Earth
And I regain
I fly and I serve
I show the pictures
The memories the names
I hear the quietness
The empty of outer space
I met my nightmares
My memories my pain
It’s time to gain
my burning life again
Hollow like hallow
And follow the sorrow
Shadow with sorrow
And follow the hollow
Since man cannot live without miracles, 
he will provide himself with the miracles of his own making. 
He will believe in any kind of deity 
even though he may otherwise be a heretic, an atheist, and a rebel.
Flames
in the age of hell
in the age of fire
War
in the name of God
in the holy empire
Burn the witch in pyre.
Death
in the name of God
in the name of fire
Love
for the grace of God
for the saints for liars
Fire
in the name of Lord
to impure desire
Lord
you the greatest one
blow up the pyre
O Lord our God, 
help us to tear their bodies to bloody shreds with our shell. 
Help us to drown the thunder of the guns 
with the shrieks of their wounded.
In the name of God
in the name of fire
For an endless life
in the holy empire
In the name of hell
your soul inquires
The warmth on my face
is the hot of fire
The world itself is the will to power 
and nothing else! 
And you yourself are the will to power
and nothing else!
Pray for the earth, for the forest, for the fire.
Call all the spirits of the globe and desire
All power that comes from within.
Crimes in the name of the gods and the power.
Now, I feel that brightest hour
To come back to life after being dead.
Hail to the gods of fire and hail.
Hail to the gods of pyre and hail.
Hail to the earth, to the air, to the rain.
Thanks to the gods for the air I breath.
Gods of the Earth.
In our eternal touch with the nature
We see communions of life and death.
We see their joyous inseparable unity.
We learn that life is as beautiful as death.
The mind is universe 
and can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven.
Beyond the burning fire, heaven and hell
Today I give you choices: life or death
I offer you desire, I sentence you to death
Today I give you a choice, I give you Hell
Heaven or hell, heaven or hell or fire, heaven or hell
Life or death
Sentenced to burn in fire, burning to death
Beyond the blazing fire, heaven and hell
Heaven or hell, heaven or hell or fire, heaven or hell
Life or death
Heaven and hell and fire
Heaven or hell
Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom
I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise
Heaven or hell, heaven or hell or fire, heaven or hell
Life or death
Heaven and hell
Fire and death
Heaven and hell
Sentenced to Death
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Church, 
by any Church that I know. 
My own mind is my own Church.
Hallowed be thy name, hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be the fire, hallowed be the fire
Hallowed be thy name, hallowed be thy name
Flames and pyre, flames and pyre
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be the fire
Hallowed be thy name
Flames and pyre
Hallowed be thy name, hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be the fire, hallowed be the fire
Hallowed be thy name, hallowed be thy name
War and fire, war and fire
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be the fire

Eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth
Burn for burn and wound for wound
Love for love and guile for guile
Blood for blood and blow for blow
Eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth
I care not:
It is an heretic that makes the fire,
Not she which burns in't. 
I'll not call you tyrant;
But this most cruel usage of your queen,
Not able to produce more accusation
Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
Yeah, scandalous to the world.
The earth,
Thousands of years of wrath and pain
The birth,
A kingdom of light and fire will reign
The life,
Serve me and then eternity you gain
The death,
In gardens with seeds and fruits you reign
and death
Cross of fire
Cross of fire
Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.
Blazing up the fire, burn my sacred sins in rain
My beloved desires, die out and lost in pain
Wealth dreams and pyres disappeared in foggy day
Marbled old Messiahs betrayed me hard and loudly I pray
Burning hopes and voices, calling loudly my name
Silent words and noises whisper loudly and say
The angel, I won’t serve again
I won’t have a place anymore in heaven
It’s my own soul, it’s my own mind
And can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.
Awake, arise, or be forever fallen
Long is the way and hard that out of hell leads up to light
I won’t serve again. I will reign again.
I will reign in hell and not serve in heaven.
The angel, I won’t serve again
I won’t have a place anymore in heaven
It’s my own soul, it’s my own mind
And can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.
Hey, God intends to light your way with fire
Save my sinful soul and show the faith with pyre
Lord and liar
Pray! Fall on your knees and call my name Messiah
Shame, shame on you that feel and hate desire
Gods and liars
In the name of the God and the holy spirit
Pray for my sins please relieve my pain
In the name of the Son and the holy spirit
I obey you to follow my path of death
Blood of my blood
We are not one!
Flesh of my flesh
Blood of my blood
We are not one!
And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.
I fall from the holy empire, an angel that loosing his path.
I am tormented with passion and fire, 
I am tormented with pride, greed and lust
The raven,
Once upon a midnight dreary, 
while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded, nearly napping, 
suddenly there came a tapping,
I am dreaming flying higher and higher, 
I am dreaming hope, fear, love and pain
My graceful forbidden desire, 
they always call whisper my name
Prophet said I, 
Thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate yet all undaunted, 
on this desert land enchanted,
On this home by Horror haunted
tell me truly, I implore.
Is there
is there balm in Gilead?
tell me, tell me, I implore!
Quoth the Raven 
Nevermore
I fall from the holy empire, 
an angel that loosing his path.
I am tormented with passion and fire, 
I am tormented with pride, greed and lust
Deep into that darkness peering, 
long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!
I shrieked, upstarting
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken!
quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart,
I fall from the holy empire, an angel that loosing his path.
I am tormented with passion and fire, 
I am tormented with pride, greed and lust
And the Raven, never flitting, 
still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light over him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted
nevermore!
We are all devils and make this world our hell
Exiled angels that wallow in sin and curse
Make your choice, wish you well
Serve in heaven or rule in Hell
A fool's paradise is a wise man's hell
Love delights, forbidden apples
Hale hellfire, burning spell
Our Heaven is their Hell
The Sons of Hell
The Sons of Hell
Heaven shine bright, but so do flames
I see the light, I see the shades
Pay the price choose your faith
Burn in fire or live your death
Your mind can make a heaven of Hell
A hell of heaven, a magic spell
Make your choice, wish you well
Serve in heaven or rule in Hell
Heaven
Fire
Heaven
Pyre
The Sons of Hell
The Sons of Hell
Make your choice, wish you well
Serve in heaven or rule in Hell

The sweet smell of warm blood,

Your fucking guts
Splattered everywhere
Ghoul!
The suffocating stench
Of corpses putrefying,
I love this butchery
I'm the king of the world!
Ghoul!
Violent torture,
Death has arrived,
Armageddon,
Terror and fright,
Bleeding corpses,
Rotting decay
Anarchy,
Violent torture,
Antichrist,
Lucifer,
Son of Satan
Pure Fucking Armageddon
Pure Fucking Armageddon!
Demonic laughter your cremation
Your lungs gasp for air but are filled with blood
A sudden crack as I crushed your skull
The remind of your life flashes by
A life that soon won't be
Smiling with axe in my hand
Evil's rotten hand you'll see
I come forward
Deathcrush
I'll send you to your maker
I'll send you to your death
Death nicely crucified
Death, heads on stakes
The barbeque has just begun
Deathcrush
Bleed down to the fucking core
You're going down for fucking more
Screw your slimy guts
Driving me fucking nuts!
Chainsaw in my bleeding hands
As I start to cut you in two
Your guts are steaming out
And I just love the sight!
Maggots crawling in her cunt
I just love to lick that shit
Bury you in a slimy grave
You will rot forever there!
Come hear the moon is calling,
The witching hour draws near,
Come hear the bell is tolling,
Mortals run in fear,
Prepare the altar now and hear the virgin cry,
Hold fast the sacrifice,
For now it's the time to die,
All hell breaks loose,
Hell's breaking loose.
Unveil the pentagram,
And feel the demons lust,
Come watch the holy men,
Who look on in disgust,
Come taste blood,
And feel the heat of satan's breath,
Look in the sky's and see,
The warriors of death,
All hell breaks loose,
Hell's breaking loose,
Witching hour.
Our work is now complete,
The blood runs fast and free,
And satan takes his bride,
And cry's of blasphemy,
All hell rejoices at the child,
That she will bear,
And satans only son,
Shall be the worlds despair,
All hell breaks loose,
Hell's breaking loose,
Witching hour.
Your stinking corpse I desire
nothing can take me higher
Fucking you till your bones break
Another one has to die
Come dripping from my dick
Fucking you to the core
Can't take this anymore
My brain is driving me insane
Necrolust
Eating the flesh of a thousand corpses
Bloodsucking cuntless nuns
her guts were boiling out of her butt
Eating her slimey cunt as I hold her tits
Every time this year
This dark fog will appear
Up from the tombs it comes
To take one more life that can be near
In the middle of Transylvania
All natural life has for a long time ago gone
It's thin and so beautiful
But also so dark and mysterious
Once again the priest is messing
May the god bless us all
The fog is here again
That will complete this funeral
From a place empty of life
Only dead trees are growing here
As it comes from afar
Only dead trees are growing here
Funeral fog
Funeral fog
Everything here is so cold
Everything here is so dark
I remember it as from a dream
In the corner of this time
Diabolic shapes float by
Out from the dark
I remember it was here I died
By following the freezing moon
It's night again
Night you beautiful
I please my hunger
On living humans
Night of hunger
Follow it's call
Follow the freezing moon
Darkness is growing
The eternity opens
The cemetery lights up again
As in ancient times
Fallen souls die behind my steps
By following the freezing moon
My name was written with
Fire in the place you only can see
When your time has come
When you walk down in the
Land of shadows for eternity
The demon flies in the blackened
Starless skies and crawls in
The bottomless depths of Hell
The name which will be a
Thousand times cursed in eternity
The demon flies in the blackened
Starless skies and crawls in
The bottomless depths of Hell
Condemned to wander, until it comes
To the cruelest snake that crawls
The bloody history from the past
Deceased humans now forgotten
An age of legends and fear
A time now so distant
Less numbered as they were their lives
So primitive and pagan
Superstitions were a part of the life
So unprotected in the dark nights
Pagan fears
The past is alive
The past is alive
Woeful people with pale faces
Staring obsessed at the moon
Some memories will never go away
And they will forever be here
A dream of another existance
You wish to die
A dream of another world
You pray for death
To release the soul one must die
To find peace inside you must get eternal
I am a mortal, but am I human?
How beautiful life is now when my time has come
A human destiny, but nothing human inside
What will be left of me when I'm dead?
There was nothing when I lived
What you found was eternal death
No one will ever miss you
A face in stone decayed by age
A man who has returned to tell of his damnation
Fears so deep, the mouth open wide
The dream died away before dawn of this time
Ancient times legends stories so dark
Blackened his sight
Now not even the memories are left
Back after such a long time
The stone is cold as death
But what formed its true fears
Only the wind is able to tell
Tell me
what did you see there
In the darkness of the past
The eyes 
stares so empty
The mouth screams so silent
Tell me
what did you see there
In the darkness of the past
Visions of that no mornings
Light ever will come
I'm too old now
The dark is so near
Will I ever reach the land beyond
This is where we go when we have to die
I've been old since the birth of time
Time buried me in earth
Centuries ago I tasted blood
Buried by time and dust
Many years have passed since the funeral
Missing the blood of human throats
So many years, ages ago
I must await, feel my body's stench
Wandering out of space
Wandering out of time
A world out of light, death at the end
Only silence can be heard
Silence of peoples fears
No one knows my grave
Buried by time and dust
Welcome!
To the elder ruins again
The wind whispers beside the deep forest
Darkness will show us the way
The sky has darkened thirteen as
We are collected woeful around a book
Made of human flesh
Here is no peace
The books blood written pages open
We follow with our white eyes
The ceremonial proceeding
In the circle of stone coffins
We are standing with our black robes on
Holding the bowl with unholy water
Beyond of death, of darkness
A land beyond for sure
dark as my hatred
Several times saw it
Because of death that brings them near
Memories from my past time
And now I'll see the sorcerer
He must find the cure to my dark subconscious
To my dark memories about all hatred upon the dead
The world's gone
In my mind the horror lives
Death from the past time
He must find the cure to my dark subconscious
To my dark memories about all hatred upon the dead
Nightsky, death awaits
I fall to die, wings of funeral
The curse of the old cemetery
That goes on, watch your hold
curse of death
Satan's been torturing my soul
Sorcery. I wish to die
Winds of death, winds of funeral
The curse of the old cemetary
A magic so pure, winds of funeral
curse of death
Satan's been eating, torturing my soul
Are you disgusting?
Life is trash, trash of the dead
Where the fuck is
Cum to cream on dead
Are you disgusting?
Disgusting disgusting
I can see hatred?
Are you disgusting?
Disgusting disgusting
Everything Here Is So Cold
Everything Here Is So Dark
I Remember It As From A Dream
In The Corner Of This Time
Diabolic Shapes Float By
Out From The Dark
I Remember It Was Here I Died
By Following The Freezing Moon
It's Night Again, Night You Beautiful
I Please My Hunger, On Living Humans
Night Of Hunger Follow It's Call
Follow The Freezing Moon
Darkness Is Growing, Eternity Opens
The Cememtary Lights Up Again
As In Ancient Times
Fallen Souls Die Behind My Steps
By Following The Freezing Moon
Every time this year
this dark fog will appear
up from the tombs it comes

In the middle of transylvania
All natural life has for a long

beautyful but also so dark and mysterious.
Once again the priest is messing

From a place empty of life.

Back after such a long time
the stone is cold as death
But what formed it's true fears
only the wind is able to tell
They speak...
In the garden of the prophet
Divine madness...
The order of the cosmic immoral
For what is humanity
If not forlorn
And crawling to my hands
When the moment sings
For I have read the signs
And I have solved the riddle
of eternal life
The Jinnah have spoken
For I have read the signs
And I have solved the riddle
of eternal life...
I am the key of dark passion
I drink my blood, I eat my flesh
A serpent kiss I give to woman
A voyage through vortex scapes.
Serpent of Eve
Now there is an acid taste of life
Abhorrent Christendom
inside burning
Proclaim the fall of Seraphs
ad modium muscorum in marimo numero
Abyssmally distorted human morals
A serpent christ holy smile
seven planetary demons
Serpent of Eve.
In these nights of magic
Where great pamis obscured
By the fantasy dragon made real
By the powers of lingering trauma
I looked beyond the dawn of day
Beyond the angstridden faces
Into the mind captured behind
Living the lie of the weakened ones
I captured the moment given
I denied the sickening love
Turned to the purity of anger
I saw myself in the abyss
Complete fullness I now own
I return to earth a demonrace
Denied by man through ages
Now I walk the dying soil
Atrocities turned beauty
Machines of torture turned art
Beneath your cities I sleep
At dawn I weep...
All the stars in the north are dead now
All the morals of wasted human... 
Debris
Walk with me into the night
Do not remove the cobwebs
of war clinging to your face
They will bell of pains unknown
All the stars in the north are dead now
All the morals of wasted human debris
Torn to pieces
handcrafted delirium
One war remains
WAR of everything
Christendom religion of pity 
god of the sick
We have discovered our way we know the road
We have found the way out of millennia of labyrinth
Beyond the north, beyond the ice, beyond death
There was a thunderstorm in our air
The nature, which we are, grew dark
All that proceeds from weakness we loathe
We declare not peace but WAR
We shall be unleashed now
From darkness we create light
Beware decaying humans
For we shall destroy
We are the way of millennium to come
In the century where man dies
We the huntress of the hollow hills
Must put ourselves above pity
Above self deception as law
We must be again as once were
We the soul of the earth
As reaping time descends
The sour gain of mercy withers
Into the night we must go into the darkest abyss
To a level of consciousness unknown to Christendom
We want life we crush the dream of heaven
As we bring the blade down one swift move
We are the chosen ones chosen by will to life
You life lairs crawl on you banded knees
As you finally die you will eventually have lost more
By not living by the sword than what you lose in death
Not by mercy by strength we end your pity lives
Not by spirit by flesh we awaken the beast within
Knee deep in your repulsive blood we march
Victorious by the power of our minds and bodies
Watch the twilight of your god
As you system cracks and all your life is dead priest
Take a look into our minds
Feel the pulse of omnipotent strength
Take a look into our souls
Feel your life drained of everything that was
Hear my words feel my wrath
Your death is sweet
All your life is dead priest
DEAD!!
The death throes of your final benediction echoes
Down the spiral of the world's spine
Down upon your great army behind the burning lake
The fiery last days of your reign on earth
Your falseness is your pity pride
Your cowardliness is your whole life
My blood is the way of your future
My army of pureness will crush your idols
Age of empire total war
Paradise lies in the shadow of my sword
Have i been understood?
For everything around me i experience is cold and dead
The blood of others is of a colder substance and taste
Therefore i must spill and serve
The blood that in me runs vibrant
In the frost of the dying
It will be the resurrection
Of the brotherhood of holy death
In the year of the Holy Roman Empire
Of night times to come and last
The day of which i shall
Lay my sword upon your throats
Upon the mighty warriors
Of the land of northern regions
Upon the shores of our desolate coast within the waves
I can see the wreckage floating ashore of the dying culture
And so i greet those who still have eyes to observe and see
And who still have courage to break through into the
dying light
You have experience the river of blood
Which i here flowed day by day
Against our sworn enemies
I came not to send peace but a sword
And i
i have made war
Development came like a sudden death in the family
No one could foresee
In the multi layers of paralyzed christened lies
But which the earth exploded
And bodies burned to ashes
The leader of the men died first
And common people changed
Into beasts of genocide
I penetrated the mind of god
Why are there assents rather than nothing?
Enter now my palace of sacrificial guilt
On the axis of the killing fields of Judas
Into the void of juxtapositioned emptiness
My kingdoms are for the few
As in beauty are for the few
I know the future the past has evaporated
Exhibit the beast of pale complexion
The war of a millennia has passed away
Colder is the sun that fades in the distant
Brighter the bloodsword running red
Inside your mind there is a battleship
The snugness penetrate your being
As if your whole life is being erased
By intoxication of some stranger's eye
For i am the way
Your painful exclusion
From past morals
Your future's contractual designer
You have now entered from the womb
In my reconstruction from deconstruction
Where instruments of genetic distortion is me
Abandon your pious ways
You
Between sacrifice and worms
It will Take you lifetimes of dying to live again
In my strata of war
And you think that death is finally home
Morphing in cell structures
The future is still hidden
Time bends like mirror light
I am in your mind
You are part of me
As me in you, you in me
Do you hear with eyes?
The universe is crunching
After the war... 
silence
Not in the black hole of stretched time
You ones had blood in your veins
The blood so black it hurts
Remembrance is torn away
I offer cosmos in my design
Chromosome needles in your arms
The suffering of a thousand voices
My science hurts
Values arises from pain
Birth is pain
No fairytales from dust dead books
Birth is pain
In a circle of stars
In the afterglow of the last war
Do you hear the voice?
Nothing but demon ashes remained
You lost everything you believed
But me the reconstructionist the voice
All paranoia of rotting drugs
What could be Satan himself?
One star left in the rotting ocean
You scream in birth all of you
A river left...
a river of blood
Of life anew
All paranoia of rotting drugs
What could be Satan himself?
I feel the light breeze
The sun takes control
And nothing here remains
But you but me
Incorporated bloodlust, 
Incinerated carcass,
Incarnated in my blood, 
Inanimated deathfuck, 
Interlocked repulsive souls,
Incantations flowing free, 
She fucking hates you all!
Intermented in my inhumanity, 
Interdicted from the human face,
Incompatible with this fucking world, 
Intercourse with raping demons, 
Interlude in collapsing ethics,
Invincible now in eternity, 
She fucking hates you all! 
WHORE!
Incorporated bloodlust, 
Incinerated carcass, 
Incarnated in my blood,
Inanimated deathfuck, 
Interlocked repulsive souls, 
Incantations flowing free.
Caress the deceitful snake, 
The one who speaks in tongues
Of all my devastating truths, 
Collect the power of my dreams
Cast by the devious fire demons, 
A thousand whorish tongues
A fiendish lust a hallow trust.
In Black Death, salute the visions, 
Mayhem of living, infected blood.
In this, dark night of the soul!!
I close my eyes to the world, 
Kiss my skinless corpus,
Make me revel in your weak souls, 
Make me feast on your nightmares.
Death's heads enshrined in my head, 
I deal exclusively in mysterious pain
I seal the orbits of misanthropy.
The mystical blood runs tonight, 
Gifting through your inner thighs,
A moment of inconceivable lust.
Inside a mind so deranged, 
how I wish you all were dead,
Annoying humanity sickens me, 
I contemplate your extinction,
The beast I caress you never see, 
everyday I destroy your lives,
Inside my castlewalls life runs red!
I have you now inside my head, 
I crush your feeble maggot minds,
the flies collect the remnants, 
The Locusts shatter flesh. FLESH!
My work almost complete...
The spells are cast, 
your dreams won't last, 
in perfect destruction,
The spells are cast, 
your dreams won't last, 
you fell for my seduction.
There's a sign carved deep, 
In the palm, of your hand,
There's a birthmark craving, 
On the left side of your heart.
Your life was forever structured, 
composed and eternally given,
The dying you produce never stops, 
In the sound of universal destruction.
There's an inherent nihilism in your spirit.
Into your glory of emptiness, 
I send my lifeforce, My Death
Be death with me, 
Be death with me, 
death with me, 
death with me.
My Death
The claws of death await you, 
Soul less on your deathbed,
The witches dance in circles, 
As your manhood fades away,
When the world of glass shatters, 
A shapeshifter appears before you,
Exposing your loathsome self, 
Life does not forgive weakness.
This is all but falseness, 
You have nothing, you are nothing,
I shall reveal your truth, 
I Am the Ghoul you fear,
I Am the psychic truth, 
I Was There when Satan wept.
No spiritual awakenings exists, 
extreme effort of pulling life.
Vultures feasting in your consciousness, 
the factories of Mayhem is essence
Cornucopia of diseased dreams, 
In the combination of lesser worlds,
the solution to the enigma lies beyond, 
the spectrum of what minds achieve.
Sequences of the values of punishment, 
displays the utter consequences,
of what you do in forgetfulness, 
how pathetic man is before reality.
I saw an eye in the sky, 
Our lady sneaks of the world revealed,
upon the shores of the end, 
everything comes to life in me.
My eyes have opened to the world.
In this intimacy of the killing, 
dust reflections of outer limits,
this is what I have become, 
I have the power to take life.
The true face of my race, 
do I have the power to give life?
The true face of my race!
True face, Silence the enemies of my Kingdom
Sweeping from the scarlet sky, 
Down to my dying eyes on earth.
Brings back all my feverish beasts.
Sweeping from the scarlet sky, 
Down to my dying eyes on earth.
True face!
I will present you with this fornication. 
Something in space-time is logically ill.
What can be seen in the rear view mirror, 
expectancy was a Mephisto's gasp,
Your past was never quite there, 
there was nothing that loose in the
constituents of your substance, 
it does indeed exist in parts of your neural
commitments to the mind body, 
Or does evil exist?
There was always something paranoid 
in the ways she behaved in your guilt,
Conclusions are never to be trusted!
You are not dead, you never existed... 
You are not dead.
Her devotees were never that pure, 
pure existence was never arbitrary,
Not in my convictions of the truth, 
she gave the demon seeds life,
the necessity of the game given, 
displayed a virtue unseen in you.
There is gang-green in the tubes,
of the vermicular ethics of how your world view presents itself.
Contradictions in terms of how, 
your life evolves in the chain of being.
I claim you were never a part of reality.
This is where your life lie grows pale, 
never known to your mirror self,
She was a creature alive in you, 
But I put my hand through the...
Hell was never an option for you, 
Luciferian tolerance yields the given,
Your dissolving truth tables
You are not dead, you never existed
The sum of all you ever knew equals zero. 
You are not dead, you never existed. 
You are not dead, you never existed... 
You are not dead, you never existed.
To creature give life
Create a primitive worker
That he may bear the yoke assigned
Pillars supporting sky crumble
Sun moon the stars pour down
Rivers and oceans rush where the earth sinks
Great conflagration quenched by raging flood
North and south polars
Counterchange
Screaming world
Turning over
Sky makes war with the earth
Fragments fall down
And the darkness that follows
Rent
In great
Chasms
Tachylite lava from the abyss
Turn into a pillar of vapour
Great heat boil the sea
Death of a continent
Enormous surge of water
Wipe out humanity
Coming of ice
A cataclysmic flood
Destroys the advanced
Mankind of high tech age
Wall of water
Sweep across the earth
Wall of water
Fossilize all
Arrival of an achromatic mechanism
Hidden agenda, pious fraud of ages
Control, alteration, manipulation, antagonism
Human abilities perish in the acid of sorcery
Their senses turn into rusty strings
Victimized, possessed, superhuman undead
Shattered be the crystal of a lost civilization
Consumed be the human brain
And like hot sands slashing
Across the deserts’ face
The lies whirl about the earth
Telepathic illusion injected into mass pathology
Lies of all religions of priests
Versions of genesis
And non-existent prophets
A dry silhouette of dead god
Propelled by the
Damaged frontal lobes
The obtuse humans
Roam in somnambulism
Towards the deaf walls
Kneel and pray to nothingness there
As if the dead toll
Of bloodless massacre
Holy charisma as mind control shift
Psychic magnetic field
Endless emanation braindeads
Pierced by
Phalloid obelisks
No one not even there
Saviour had ever been resurrected
Abandoned, disposed, discarded
I order all symbols crumble
I order the consumption of all churches
Where I came from
I must return
No more, nothing left to do
No other mission
Weak and devastated
The strength had gone
Don’t want to know more
Don’t want to understand
Lost and empty
Only want to go, pass away
Send the self back
Exist here no more
Completely nothing
So many empty words been heard
So many meaningless thought been received
Whatever done equals zero times everything
No love no hate no faith no memory
Enter another sphere
Complete the emptiness
Desperately alone, fuck the race
Wide open and passing through
Subordination to another will
Sophisticated subtle techniques
Mind psyche wide opened
Stimulated triggers
Thought forms of malevolence and fear
In the veins of the floating genocide
Robot of voids by ultrasonic stimulations
Holds down the vibrational field
Rituals take place on grid of vortex points
Terror horror and hatred created
Worship of deconstructive negative pole
Nourishment for the non-physical forms
To contact and manifest entities of another world
Flying through the depths of space
Someone’s hand on the wheel
From where the lizard eye
Focuses the infinite line of alienation
Enter the gate of eternal lights
Appear another existence form
The immerge bended into the abyss
Inner world in the depths of the planet
Where the inverted sun never set
Illumination the enormous entities
Hiding them from the human eyes
Converse tubes to the surfaces and back
Only certain chosen can enter
Penetrate the lions at the gates
Illusions flow
After the next Iron Age
Mankind lost
The ships of flames rise to the sky
Annunaki on board
Watcher searches inside the thoughts
Inner waves corresponding outer frequencies
Rider falls down
The slave set free
Unknown path
The ways to wisdom are hidden
Shall the speaker silence
And the memories fade apart
Like the new attraction of outer space
Where the atomic corpus melts
Beyond the source of fears
Watcher sits on the borderthrone of insanity
Giving solution of existence from nonsense
Spawn of Annunaki, crossbreed make war
Make war with the universe death of the planet
Fall of an aeon
The great work of ages
The acid of sorcery
Deluded versions of revelations
The symbols repulse
Whatever done equals zero
Times nothing
Completing the control of emptiness
Enter the external lights
The conversed tubes to the surface and beyond
Detraction of outer space
Nemesis of genesis
Come to my spinal serpent
Fatal doom in DNA-design
Result of the ancient covenant
Outer races made upon mankind
The genesis of human race
Endless cosmic experiment
To enslave the supreme self
Hybrid of alien genes
Illusion of flesh and blood
Embedded in the core of mind
Cold-blooded instincts
Demon seed inside
Eternal mental distress
Ruthless tyrant of self
Hopeless race of victims
Wolf among sheep
Territorial, deceitful
Aggression and dominance
Locked in time
Reflection of your inner self
Impossible to defeat
Schizophrenic paranoid
Atavistic enemy
I'm that voice in your mind
I came from the end of time
To antagonize humankind
Determining the most sublime
Human labrats terrorized
Altared personas triggered
Stalked individuals irradiated
Torture, submission
A detour to suicide
Disassociation
Subhumanization
Born behind enemy lines
The battlefield is our minds
Phoenix from the ashes of failure
Velon bloodprime
Your souls undermine
Symbols burned inside
pull the trigger
kill the target
No future
Lost forever
End of torment
Flashback of lights
Phantom halos come to life
Black piercing eyes
Nocturnal visit of the fourth kind
Petrified paralyzed
I hover above beyond myself
On the chrome altar
The seed is implanted
I was chosen to carry
They told me to be proud
Behind lights are shapes of horrors
No feelings no emotions
Spikes of electrodes
Injected into the skull
Encoded amnesia
Hall of nightmares
Dark rift of the soul
Ascension
Descension
My soul slips into
The morphing aether
Through grey matter
My pseudo life
Preordained fate
Destination known
In between time
Nothing to decide
No choice no free will
Six seconds delay
Six seconds to life
Six seconds till death
Hypnotic radio waves
To conquer all minds
Turning on the coils
Antenna of delta time
The throne is lighting up
Brain waves in hyperspace
Transmitting fear
Total mass manipulation
Endless tears
Millions of children caged under the ground
Nerve drugged into psytrance
Sexual cultivation of creative force
Satanic ritual abuse
Psychotic master mind
Behind the false memories
The will of man is broken
Esoteric warfare
Dull care is slain
By the power
Of our ancient rites
One flame alone
Must light this pyre
Of pure eternal flame
Bring fire!
Our funeral pyre awaits the corpse of care
Ferried across the shadowy tide
In all the ancient majesty of death
Fools! Ye burn me once again!
Me ye cannot slay
I spit upon
Your fire!
In the flames that eat thine effigy
We will read the sign:
Midsummer
Sets us free!
Fake planes weaving
Chemtrails cross the sky
Scalar waves
Frequency cage
Nowhere to hide
Death from above
Salt the earth
Kill the bees
Collapse the colonies
Nanotech zombie dust
Morgellon machines
Everyone will receive
The mark of the beast
Blue beams project false prophets
Poison frankenfood
Man made bacteria
Forced toxic vaccinations
Psychotronic holocaust
Invisible mind police
Silent weapons for quiet wars
Lost chance for life
Mass extinction
Coffin planet
Thrown away
Out of time
Omega point
Genderless manimals
Dehumanized society
Artificial unintelligence
Emerging singularity
End of evolution
Resistance is futile
I am the transcendent man
Cast down between two world
Across the dark sea of awareness
The body hologram born
From the dust of a dying star
Neverending now of infinite illusions
Free to tremble in fear and pain
Limited by misfortune
Flawed by design
Lost in a lost world
Gods in exile
Feed on the weak
And the wounded
Quarantined in the
Labyrinth of time
Set free from gravity's weight
Alchemical wedding
Of crystalline heavy light
Cabal disguised
Divided not ruled
By hidden hands
Circumvented
Undermined
Betrayer
Depraved self unveiled
Insatiable cruel and perverted
Nothing thou shall hear, the nobles of all
The ill-founded truth unfolds to all
The time is ending
Prepared for death
Nothing remains
No acts, no words
End it all
The shame of the world
Dominion pulverized
The dying false king
Hidden in the woods
New rulers command
Dethroned and condemned
Distant screams
Silence, silence
The false king on the forest bed
His head severed
Burned alive
In purgatory flames
Buried alive
In depths of conscience
Crematory ashes
Lust for the dead
Property of sin
Earth opens
Pentagram, bleeding flesh turning inside out
Golgotha burning, slaughter the lamb
Invasion unreal
A pestilence of Ahriman
Genocide unreal
Pestilence of Lucifer
Burned alive
Demonic obedience
Buried alive
Doctrine's blinded slave
Crematory ashes
Lust for the dead
Property of sin
Earth opens
So much flowing bad blood
Rising like the flood
There is no cure for what you have
Nothing can fix it
You poisoned your own blood
There is no coming back
No way out, you are possessed
Face your hopeless fate
Prodigal
Bad blood
Brotherhood destroyed
I won't forgive
I won't forget
I will take my revenge
You crossed my red line
I sentence you to death
When the time comes
I will have you killed
Die
Now
Bad blood
Open your veins
Drain out all the filth within
Open your veins
I won't forgive
I won't forget
Bad blood
Die now
Die now
You crossed my red line
I sentence you to death
When the time comes
I will have you killed
Die
Now
Bad blood
A man walks from the gates of grace
Willing to sin self proclaimed
Heavenly lust burns your soul
A sunk mind and courage
Salvation in your death
Salvation in your blood
No sunrise, the throne is gone
Falsified and hated
The wicked blessing of a demon
Curse
Stronger than life
Stronger than death
Burned in flesh, no healing
Burning wings, dreadful soul
Ah, heaven is burning
Ah, trumpets blow on deaf ears
Ah, heaven is burning
Ah, trumpets blow on deaf ears
A man walks from the gates of grace
Willing to sin self proclaimed
Heavenly lust burns your soul
A sunk mind and courage

No sunrise, the throne is gone
Falsified and hated
Demon

Ah, heaven is burning
Ah, trumpets blow on deaf ears
Stand up Legion
Rejoice
Let him fill your punctured heart
The beast awaits
Coming out of the sea
The bottomless pit
He lurks in the shadows
He hides in man
He hides in the shadows
He lurks in man
Smoldering beneath the surface
Prophecy fulfilled
Cruelty and wickedness
Man is wolf to man
Woe unto him
Woe unto me
Distressed screams from below
Hollow souls racking death
Planet black, god is dead
Rape the angels to their death
The Promethean flame will lead the way
Let the darkness take your soul
Feel the flame bursting
Suffer beyond the abyss
Rapturous killing of a holy man
Divine torture of god
Let the angels burn
Energy of Chaos
Dreaming their darkest dreams
Spawning the cosmic gods
Worthless abominations destroyed
Preparing for war
Against the gods
Ultimate blasphemy
Captured and imprisoned
Power-hungry whore
Sliced in half
Creation to rule
Now spawned
Infernal Undead
Anti cosmic gods
Worshipping the Demiurge
Keeping people blind
Black flames tried extinguish
Total lawlessness
Exterminate
Before me lay
Ten thousand dead first born
That never saw the light
Never felt the fright
The lust, the night
The fright, the night
A snake is crawling and death is doomed
The fearless man, behold him
Arise
The poison lies
The serpent's tongue
Deceitful mind
Wisdom fled, intoxicated
The demon's tongue, exaggerated
In the clearest light, in the clearest black
Evil awaits the fearless one
Death awaits for simple minded
Lying kind, assassinated
The fellow man, obliterated
Daemon spawn, underrated
The poison lies
The serpent's tongue
Deceitful mind
Deified decay
Prostrate and receive
Purified through waste
Baptized in disease
Horns of stench and tail of slime
Claws of fate and fang of time
Damp earth turns hope to death
Pulsating corpse feeds and shelters
Elementals of mirror spheres
Rise and unite
Make complete dissolution
Into nihil eternal naught
Of worms
Black soul
Arms to reach but not to feel
Black hole
Rot divine disused and spoiled
Black dope
Riddle of crystal mind methods
Black sun
Paranormal triumph of thought
Skin outgrown
Promises to loss
Chimes begin the feast
Worms and ruin of the beast
From these maleficent realms
Invoke the oath under will
Come atrocious
Omnipotent
Absorb all life
Before this iron age
Creation was fouled
By the stories of the false gods
Invoke the oath
Unhallowed truth
Catharsis by disaster
Gehenna opened up
Between outsiderness
And the captured minds
By the swearing
Reality darkened
Fathomless void
Despairing silence
Dead and mummified
Festering and resurrection
Invoke the oath
Invoke the oath
Mightiest am I,
but I am not alone in this cosmos of mine.
For the black hills consists of black souls,
souls that already dies one thousand deaths.
Behind the stone walls of centuries they breed their black art.
Boiling their spells in cauldrons of black gold.
Far up in the mountains,
where the rain fall not far,
yet the Sun cannot reach.
The wizards, my servants,
summon the souls of macrocosm.
No age will escape my wrath.
I travel through time and I return to the future.
I gather wisdom now lost.
I visit again the eternally ancient caves,
before a mighty Emperor thereupon came.
Watching the mortals discovering my chronicles, guarded
by the old demons, even unknown to me.
Once destroyed their souls are being summoned
to my timeless prison of hate.
It is delightful to feast upon the screaming souls
that were destroyed in my future.
How many wizards that serve me with evil, I know not.
My empires has no limits.
From the never ending mountains black, to the bottomless lakes.
I am the ruler and has been for eternities long.
I am them.
From the never ending mountains black, to the bottomless lakes.
I am the ruler and has been for eternities long.
My wizards are many, but their essence is mine.
Forever they are in the hills in their stone homes of grief.
Because I am the spirit of their existence.
I am them.
I am them.
I am them.
The wolves bark with wind in summertime.
As the moon passes the shadows. 
It was a grim tale.
The wolves pry the limbs from the conquered ones.
Carnage consumes the emptiness.
Wait till my spirits come forth.
Violate all his chosen ones.
Drink the fires of death.
Carrying the deaths of his fallen warriors
deep inside of him, in his eyes.
Walk upon this Earth tonight,
carrying the staff of cold souls.
Appear the sign of evil will.
They appear, Death and Destruction,
to a time when the angel cries.
Open your eyes again now, he is here.
He is the master of fear.
He is the wind, 
He is the storm.
He is the woods, 
He is the roots.
Nobody will escape the wrath of the Tyrant.
Forever the Beast shall wander the Earth.
When night comes creeping in,
dark restless shades arise.
Graveless souls are gathering.
Seem to ignite the flame.
Creeping shadows roam the night,
as a merciless rain is closing upon.
Demons coming to sever the Sun.
Fearsome beasts come to life.
Darkness reigns in the Cosmos.
Forces of the Devil's lair.
Innocent or brave,
they appear to rape your world.
Children of the evil and demonic
curse his love again.
Graveless souls awake,
seem to ignite the flame.
When night comes creeping in,
dark restless shades arise.
Prepare to crawl and run.
The Black is here tonight.
The heavens are lit by the stars
where years of secrets of universal forces lay hid.
They shine so bright, but yet
they have seen more evil than time itself.
Reflected in the deepless lakes
they are drowning in black elements.
They are the planetary keys to unlimited wisdom
and power for the Emperor to obtain.
They being the gods of the wolves
whom upon they bark at night,
requesting their next victim in thirst of blood.
I enjoy those moments I may haunt with these beasts of the night.
What kinds of beings are existing at the deeps of my lakes?
They surely must be of an evil race,
for no friendly thing can live
in such depressive waters.
Here is also a planet similar to the Moon, 
but its phases is only one
and it is in its most powerful for all and ever...
There passes no light without the barking of the wolves.
All these landscapes are timeless,
and this is all just a part of cosmos,
but all is mine and past and future is yet to discover...
Much have been discovered, but tomorrow
I will realise I existed before myself.
I will be reborn
before I die.
I will realise planets ages old,
created by a ruler with a crown of dragon claws,
arrived with a stargate...
a king among the wolves in the night...
An observer of the stars.
I will realise planets ages old,
created by a ruler with a crown of dragon claws,
arrived with a stargate...
a king among the wolves in the night...
An observer of the stars.
As the Darkness creeps over the Northern mountains of Norway
and the silence reach the woods, I awake and rise...
Into the night I wander, like many nights before,
and like in my dreams, but centuries ago.
Under the Moon, under the trees.
Into the Infinity of Darkness,
beyond the light of a new day,
into the frozen nature chilly,
beyond the warmth of the dying Sun.
Hear the whispering of the wind,
the Shadows calling...
I gaze into the Moon which grants me visions
these twelve full Moon nights of the year,
and for each night the light of the holy disciples fades away.
Weaker and weaker, one by one.
Weaker and weaker, one by one.
I gaze into the Moon which makes my mind pure as crystal lakes,
my eyes cold as the darkest winter nights, 
by yet there is a flame inside.
It guides me into the dark shadows beyond this world,
into the infinity of thoughts... 
thoughts of upcoming reality.
In the name of the almighty Emperor I will ride the Lands in pride,
carrying the Blacksword at hand, in warfare.
I will grind my hatred upon the loved ones.
Despair will be brought upon
the hoping children of happiness.
Wherever there is joy the hordes of the eclipse
will pollute sadness, sadness and hate
under the reign if fear.
The lands will grow black.
There is no Sunrise yet to come
into the wastelands of phantoms lost.
The lands will grow black.
There is no Sunrise yet to come.
May these moments under the Moon be eternal.
May the infinity haunt me... 
In Darkness.
Benighted darker and darker
as I walk through the woods,
into the silent shadows.
As the sky goes from dark to black, 
ice cold whispers burns my skin.
From nowhere to the deepest of my soul they speak unto me...
grievance of sadness, like the gift of sorrow.
A Moon, a bloodred full Moon lights my black hearts night.
Lightning cracks the sky and thunders roll,
through the night a chaos of storms arise.
Purgatory. 
Burning flames catch my eyes.
Into the shadows so dark I hear the choirs of evil,
a joy in blasphemy beyond my darkest fantasies.
The Gate is open...
Into the silent shadows I crawl,
upon the throne so cold,
atmosphere of melancholy.
I will forever burn...
Burn... 
Burn...
Into the silent shadows I crawl,
upon the throne so cold,
atmosphere of melancholy.
I will forever burn...
Into the silent shadows.
The heavens are lit by the stars
where years of secrets of universal forces lay hid.
They shine so bright, but yet they have seen more evil than time itself.
Reflected in the deepless lakes
they are drowning in black elements.
They are the planetary keys to unlimited wisom
and power for the Emperor to obtain.
They being the gods of the wolves
whom upon they bark at night,
requesting their next victim in thirst of blood.
I enjoy those moments I may haunt with these beats of the night.
What kinds of beings are existing
at the deeps of my lakes?
They surely must be of an evil race,
for no friendly thing can live in such depressive waters.
Here is also a planet similar to the Moon, but its phases is only one
and it is in its most powerful for all and ever...
There passes no light without the barking of the wolves.
All these landscapes are timeless,
and this is all just a part of cosmos,
but all is mine and past and future is yet to discover...
Much have been discovered, but tomorrow
I will realise I existed before myself.
I will be reborn
before I die.
I will realise planets ages old,
created by a ruler with a crown of dragon claws,
arrived with a stargate...
a king among the wolves in the night...
An observer of the stars.
I will realise planets ages old,

An observer of the stars.
Beyond the great vast forest,
surrounded by majestic mountains,
dark rivers float like tears of sorrow.
Frost submerge the holy ring of fire.
They shall rise again, for they are of Him....
The Dark Lord of eternities.
These are the Devils of Darkness.
They can not be laid to rest forever.
Resurrection... They shall haunt again,
the creatures of the night.
Blood is life. Blood is life.
Their art of death is infernal,
like their life eternal.
See the castle so proud,
but yet so grey and cold.
Their art of death is infernal,
like their life eternal.
See the castle so proud,
but yet so grey and cold.
Grey and cold.
Grey and cold.
The frost submerge. 
The Moon is on the rise.
Hear the nocturnal howling of the wolves...
the children of the night. 
They shall rise again,
resurrected through our gathering of the ancient and evil.
They shall rise again, for they are of Him....
The Dark Lord of eternities.
These are the Devils of Darkness.
They can not be laid to rest forever.
Resurrection... 
They shall haunt again,
the creatures of the night.
Blood is life. 
Blood is life.
In the name of the almighty Emperor they shall rise
and forever wander the land beyond the great vast forest.
May the wolves start to howl again.
May the age of darkness arise.
We will travel for eternities
into the unknown to reach what we seek.
Fight the ways through the barriers of light, through the wastelands
where nothing but grief have become the eternal memory.
Shield of life, sword of death held up high into the sky.
Guided by the shining Moon in the starry sky above.
In the horizon beyond black clouds of destruction rages
like dancing shadows of pain.
We will grant Him their pain.
He will grant us His flame.
In flesh and blood. He will arise
to deliver the key.
As the armours black robe slides across the landscape,
we see the land of wisdom, strength and pure evil...
Darkness, frost, hate...
the throne will be ours.
May the wolves start to howl again.
May the age of darkness arise.
May we touch the black flames
of the past again and forevermore.
Like the tide, shadows flow towards the shore of light.
The night comes whirling like a maelstrom.
Warring waves of crackling clouds embrace this nightside landscape.
The heavens bleed, through open wounds, the dim light of the Moon.
The winds are crying mournfully and tears fly with the gusts.
They whip my clenched faces freezing skin with ice-cold burning cuts.
Too long I have suffered the desert sands of time.
But as I drown in darkness it will release the sign.
My soul will leave this mortal coil of flesh and earthly life,
to fly into the mist of night, into the nightside eclipse,
and experience existence on the other side.
As a stone of scorching enthusiasm
I refract the reflecting surface of this unfathomable sea.
Growing circles of grief and pain slides across the land
as an omen of the horror yet to come.
The strength of a thousand fire-breathing demons
breed in my infernal, sinking soul.
And as I reach the surface once again
these powers are under my control.
Now I am one with the night sky majesty.
Mightiest am I,
but I am not alone in this cosmos of mine.
For the black hills consists of black souls,
souls that already dies one thousand deaths.
Behind the stone walls of centuries they breed their black art.
Boiling their spells in cauldrons of black gold.
Far up in the mountains,
where the rain fall not far,
yet the Sun cannot reach.
The wizards, my servants,
summon the souls of macrocosm.
No age will escape my wrath.
I travel through time and I return to the future.
I gather wisdom now lost.
I visit again the eternally ancient caves,
before a mighty Emperor thereupon came.
Watching the mortals discovering my chronicles, guarded
by the old demons, even unknown to me.
Once destroyed their souls are being summoned
to my timeless prison of hate.
It is delightful to feast upon the screaming souls
that were destroyed in my future.
How many wizards that serve me with evil, I know not.
My empires has no limits.
From the never ending mountains black, to the bottomless lakes.
I am the ruler and has been for eternities long.
I am them.
From the never ending mountains black, to the bottomless lakes.
I am the ruler and has been for eternities long.
My wizards are many, but their essence is mine.
Forever they are in the hills in their stone homes of grief.
Because I am the spirit of their existence.
I am them.
I am them.
I am them.
Oh mighty Lord of the Night. 
Master of beasts. 
Bringer of awe and derision.
Thou whose spirit lieth upon every act of oppression, hatred and strife.
Thou whose presence dwelleth in every shadow.
Thou who strengthen the power of every quietus.
Thou who sway every plague and storm.
Thou are the Emperor of Darkness.
Thou are the Emperor of Darkness.
Thou are the king of howling wolves.
Thou are the king of howling wolves.
Thou have the power to force any light in wane.
nor will to answer whosoever asketh the why.
Thy path is capricious but yet so wide.
With no such thing as an impediment to strong.
Every time thou consecrate me to another secret
I take another step towards Thy Pantheon.
Oh mighty Lord of the Night. 
Master of beasts. 
Bringer of awe and derision.
Thou whose spirit lieth upon every act of oppression, hatred and strife.
Thou whose presence dwelleth in every shadow.
Thou who strengthen the power of every quietus.
Thou who sway every plague and storm.
Thou are the Emperor of Darkness.
Thou are the Emperor of Darkness.
Thou are the king of howling wolves.
Thou are the king of howling wolves.
Thou have the power to force any light in wane.
nor will to answer whosoever asked the why.
Forever will I bleed for Thee.
Forever will I praise Thy dreaded name.
Forever will I serve Thee.
Thou shall forever prevail.
Orgy of silence, conspiracy of peace.
Only the sound of the cold northern breeze.
Twinsun sink fading behind the black lake.
Asleep is the mountains, yet the night is awake.
Strange is the night. Now black stars rise.
And many Moons circle through silent the night.
Along the black mountainside, scattered
by the campfires awaiting the dawn.
Two times a hundred men in battles.
Tried by the steel in the arrow, axe and the sword.
By battle worn, hunger torn, awaiting
for the Sun to break through the cold haze
and for the banners of Ebal to appear
on the hill in the Sun's first warm rays.
The elder among the men looked deep into
the fire and spoke loud with pride.
Tomorrow is a fine day to die.
Now the morning advance from far East.
Now the Sun breaks through dustclouds and haze.
Now a forest of spears appears on the hill
and steel shines bright in the Sun's first rays.
Die.
Die.
Die.
This magic winter night I see a light.
Again I hear that tune, some sort of croon.
oh my brain.
I see them gypsy waggons left in the snow.
Oh, I must see that lady, I have to know.
Gypsy woman, let me inside.
They say you know the secret, secret of all time.
So gaze into your crystal and tell me all you see.
Gypsy woman, let me know.
Oh, my son, you were never gone.
You are the Devil's child, and so am I.
Gypsy now I know you're not my mother.
You're a part of my soul, it's dear for all to see.
Oh no, no, no, I am you.
Gypsy, you're inside of me.
father of my dark self.
From within this realm, wherein Thou dwell,
by this lake of blood, from which we feed to breed,
I call silently from Thy presence, as I lay this oath.
May this night carry my will
and may these old mountains
forever remember this night.
May the forest whisper my name
and may the storm bring these words
to the end of all worlds.
May the wise moon be my witness
as I swear on my honor,
in respect of my pride and darkness itself,
that I shall rule by the blackest wisdom.
I am at one with thee.
I am the eternal power.
I am the Emperor.
Winds and storms, embrace us now.
Lay waste the light of day.
Open gates to darker lands.
We spread our wings and fly away.
Drawn towards these lands again.
Seeking death and sacred soil.
I ride the longing winds of my blackened soul,
growing stronger once I enter my empire beyond.
Behold my coming.
The fullmoon rise above me,
enlightening my realm in a silvery glow.
Yet the shadows crawl beneath my storming sky,
guarding treasures from forbidden light.
I still remember,
though ages ago it seems,
the first time I entered the gates,
the revelation of ritual death
by which I became divine.
Sacrifice of the life I had
among the flesh of the light.
And now I enter again.
Even stronger, yet amazed by what I see.
In ecstasy I mock the world.
Suddenly I memorize,
asking what I left behind.
Nothing.
Can I ever comprehend?
Will my longing ever end?
Never.
Drawn towards these lands again.
Seeking death and sacred soil.
I ride the longing winds of my blackened soul
eternally.
Close your eyes and gaze into
this realm that I reveal.
See where eternities are born.
Close your eyes, behold the powers
of the broken seal.
See the liars bound in thorns.
Fear
and you shall fall.
Weakness suffocates your will.
Dare,
yet never fail.
Wisdom guides the one,
the strong who can defy
Death.
So I speak, though, am I heard
Wasting visions on a world of blinded fools.
Still I scorn
the vacant contradiction of life,
if only to bewilder.
The final truth shall speak my name.
Thus spoke the nightspirit.
Nightspirit, spirit,
spirit, embrace my soul.
In an endless maze begotten,
to dead ends led by fools.
I sought a plague for those
who smiled at walls in humble fear.
Yet, belligerent ways came to an end.
No war could ease my hunger.
By craving death I was
to darkness reborn.
No sacrifice too great.
Caught in another maze.
Truly endless.
Still this maze is mine.
No peace for me. No peace I seek.
My quest goes far beyond.
No sacrifice too great.
Caught in another maze.
Truly endless.
Still this maze is mine.
I hail the greatest fall.
Dark is the spirit of my token.
Dark is my call.
Still craving, still torn.
Hear me, master of this realm
to which I was reborn.
Bearer of my stigma.
Yet, claim no gift, but guidance.
For I am the giver of temptation.
Thou art the executor of Thy rewards
Dark is the spirit of my token.
Dark is my call.
The cosmic forces driving me,
more noble, more free.
Take me.
Love and hate and all in between,
I greet them all in ecstasy.
Venus, seduce me.
Mars, possess me.
Tear my soul from sanity.
No sacrifice too great.
Caught in another maze.
Truly endless.
Still this maze is mine
and I am thine.
Memories of torment strikes me.
Attemps were made to suffocate me at birth.
Fools, I was already ancient.
Thou can not kill what breeds within Thee.
Alas, this agony, the emptiness of earthborn pride
hath stirred my faithful heart which guided me to darker paths.
Far away from their pestilent ways
cleansed was I from deceitful grace.
Yet, put to scorn was I by those unclean.
Enslaved by ignorance
they blindly spat upon
the deity of hate.
Awake is the darkest fiend.
By the fallen one I shall arise.
Upon bewildered masses,
to whom the indulgence of my soul portray as sin made god,
I shall revile and quell the source
whence mockery of my kind derive.
This I know: Facile shalt my quest not come to pass.
Deathwish be my gift to all at last.
Honour. Commended no longer as virtue.
Yet, shalt be extolled by light's demise.
By the fallen one I shall arise.
Arise.
Believer,
speak not to me of justice,
for none have I ever seen.
By God, I shall give as I receive.
Betrayer,
speak not to me at all.
You and this world
ripped my fucking heart out.
Vide, ravens caw in reverence.
Anthems to the Welkin at dusk.
In celebration of the few, the kin,
beyond flesh, beyond words.
Those of the core, beyond gods,
as gods received.
I float among them
on wings once broken,
now gleaming black.
I share their song
of words unspoken.
Cries of the past.
In times of fiendish tempest
bloodlust turns against the coil.
Hungry for the fall,
I greet the pit.
Blind Savage
Cursing Life.
Yet, at the moment of my final step
the hands and golden chains are given.
Bidding me
that which can not be deprived:
The bonds of trust and unity,
till the end.
Brethren and sisters of my circle,
I acclaim thee all.
When guiding stars are clouded and deranged,
fear not to take my hand.
The bonds of trust and unity.
As gods received
till the end.
Deep Green Dark Chaos.
Blinded I run down these paths.
By heart I know them.
They lead to the soaring cliffs.
Stout they stand above the water's edge,
lifeless.
And this is my foundation:
Cold stone.
Formed only by winds and time.
How invulnerable,
lifeless.
Ahh... I have longed to be at one with this
Yet, the waters call my name
For once I wish to see
the entity behind the voice.
The face of this seduction,
the beauty of my pain.
Am I blessed or am I cursed by thy presence?
What is my crime, what is my deed?
Is this life my redemption?
Shall I repent or proceed?
I hate my flesh.
Its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt.
It made me question
the essence of the I.
Slaves are those of this world
given freedom to lay chains upon The Master.
Master, master.
The wolf is no longer free.
Release the chains and come for me.
Suddenly, his mournful cries were stunned. 
Out of the cold mist came three enthralling ships. 
Sails torn by many a storm, 
and the bows adorned by the most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon.
Yet, the crew they bore... 
Three times twelve in numbers. 
They stood motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns. 
And from behind their shadowed faces came the seductive chanting. 
Bidding him on board.
Without hesitation, he accepted. 
And away they sailed...
Upon these seas,
wherein I drowned so many times,
I scatter the ashes of destiny.
Still my flames are in hunger.
With fire in my heart
shall I greet the shores ahead.
Though, I know not what will burn.
Desire...
Ahh...
In the distance
I hear the waves wash over solid ground.
And in this moment I am struck blind.
Grant me sight so I can see
that which lies ahead of me.
Cursed be my mortal eyes
for dying in the realm of Death.
Hear my call...
I return to the soaring cliffs.
They truly shine of strength.
Even though, I nothing learned.
With strength I burn...
Landscapes...
Entrance my mind with thoughts of ancient times.
I wonder...
Did they walk this path?
Open seas...
An endless horizon they seem.
I wonder...
Where did they go?
Nightsky,
source of light and dark.
I wonder...
Did they comprehend?
Did they comprehend?
Seasons running through my veins,
like snow melting on my skin.
They crawl beyond my flesh
and gasp my yearning soul.
The force of divinity.
What caused its end?
What caused this?
What caused its end?
Oh the end.
I drown in thoughts.
Yet, answers have abandoned this place
long ago.
Blood runs cold from my arm...
Another one is now to die.
Is he the last to see
the graceful entity of Nature?
Is he the last to have his heart and soul
nailed to Her embrace?
He passes on...
Memories of torment strikes me.
Attemps were made to suffocate me at birth.
Fools, I was already ancient.

Nailed in Her embrasce...

The wolves bark with wind in summertime.
As the moon passes the shadows. 
It was a grim tale.
The wolves pry the limbs from the conquered ones.
Carnage consumes the emptiness.
Wait till my spirits come forth.
Violate all his chosen ones.
Drink the fires of death.
Carrying the deaths of his fallen warriors
deep inside of him, in his eyes.
Walk upon this Earth tonight,
carrying the staff of cold souls.
Appear the sign of evil will.
They appear, Death and Destruction,
to a time when the angel cries.
Open your eyes again now, he is here.
He is the master of fear.
He is the wind, He is the storm.
He is the woods, He is the roots.
Nobody will escape the wrath of the Tyrant.
Forever the Beast shall wander the Earth.
When night comes creeping in,
dark restless shades arise.
Graveless souls are gathering.
Seem to ignite the flame.
Creeping shadows roam the night,
as a merciless rain is closing upon.
Demons coming to sever the Sun.
Fearsome beasts come to life.
Darkness reigns in the Cosmos.
Forces of the Devil's lair.
Innocent or brave,
they appear to rape your world.
Children of the evil and demonic
curse his love again.
Graveless souls awake,
seem to ignite the flame.
When night comes creeping in,
dark restless shades arise.
Prepare to crawl and run.
The Black is here tonight.
The heavens are lit by the stars
where years of secrets of universal forces lay hid.
They shine so bright, but yet
they have seen more evil than time itself.
Reflected in the deepless lakes
they are drowning in black elements.
They are the planetary keys to unlimited wisdom

The Ancient Queen.
Deadly hate, deadly love.
Dark under the shadow.
Death has been resisted.
The Ancient Queen,
ruler of the domain.
Keeper of the fury,
the Queen dwells in shadow.
Dark rivers run though me.
Darkness follows everwhere.
Kingdoms falling again and again.
Crawl to thee over again.
The Ancient Queen, the darkest woman.
Stepping through her shadow.
She who sees the soul.
Black is her blood.
Keeper of the fury.
Stepping through her shadow.
Do you see her soul?
Black is her blood.
Keeper of the fury.
Dark under the shadow.
Thy destiny lies with her.
The Ancient Queen,
ruler of the domain.
Keeper of the fury.
In shadow... 
Once our lord has come again,
all black hearts will celebrate
the darksome fiend
in the kingdom of sorrow.
Nocturnal fiends,
the beings of the night and shadows
calling forth the pure spirit
of the night.
Our reign may come secretly.
Your Lord's castle is gone.
His glory is no more,
and nothing can stop the purifying.
They remember how you conjured
all those years of sorrow.
Blasting winds of darkness conquer.
Dark lords and their minions coming through.
Hate and sin to remain.
Empty hearts fearing thy name.
Darkness hammers through on the priests.
Darkness hammers forward on the cross.
Servants of God, we will desecrate your coward race
with darkness.

Servants of God, we will desecrate your coward race

Once our lord has come again,
all black hearts will celebrate

When he returns his spirits must choose purity.
When he conquers kingdoms of death
our dead shall all reign again.
Our reign may come secretly.
Your Lord's castle is gone.
His glory is no more,
and nothing can stop the purifying.
They remember how you conjured
all those years of sorrow.
Awakened from the shadows to create.
Riding with me and with all his chosen.
Our lord to be has come again.
Riding from the past.
Little you know your life fades.
When night comes creeping in,
dark restless shades arise.
Graveless souls are gathering.
Seem to ignite the flame.
Creeping shadows roam the night,
as a merciless rain is closing upon.
Demons coming to sever the Sun.
Empty eyes come to life.
Darkness reigns in the Cosmos.
Forces of the Devil's lair.
Innocent or brave,

Children of the evil and demonic
curse his love again.
Graveless souls awake,

When night comes creeping in,
dark restless shades arise.
Prepare to crawl and run.
The Black is here tonight.
Our time is upon us.
Master! Appear!
Over the nocturnal sky
from the mountains of black we ride.
Fly!
All thy servants fly
though the serpent's darkened sky.
Hears the opponent cry,
ravaged by his terror.
Master! We ride with the storm
in his name, the sire, wolves' king.
Enter the power coursing
through veins of the night.
Who gathers winds, summons thunder,
summons rain, summons might?
Power ripples through me.
Armageddon's thunder will bring others to my side.
The throne is mine.
A blackened storm of evil.
Evil.
Master! We ride with the storm to take
revenge in the sky upon the one
who cast thee from his side.
Shifting shadows guide my way in the autumn.
From this fell alliance eternal night shall arise.
Hear the scream of the wolves calling again.
Legions are wreaking destruction upon the fortress.
They must beware his rage.
Once again he is risen.
Towns are burning, the gods arise.
Welcome the nocturnal nightmare
And suffer again.
And suffer again.
He shall suffer. Dying breed of stalwart men.
We will never deny what you can see.
In malice.
They will understand my pain.
Shifting shadows guide my way in the autumn.
From this fell alliance eternal night shall arise.
Hear the scream of the wolves calling again.
Legions are wreaking destruction upon the fortress.
Earthquakes are breaking the silence,
a vision of hate.
A wicked, foul spell of evil.
Dark winds command the throne.
Cleansed by the evil hand,
a crusade of the burning land.
A servant in the shape of a snake
blackens the bodies red.
Then it appears, the storming wind,
a challenging scar burns through the light.
A cloud of darkness prepared for me
to complete the circle of death.
The serpent gains mastery of the wind
through the storms and through the streaming snow.
Sorrow blackens the Earth when the Moon fades.
Dark winds command the throne.
Earthquakes are breaking the silence,
a vision of hate.
A wicked, foul spell of evil.
Dark winds command the throne.
Cleansed by the evil hand,
a crusade of the burning land.
An embrace from Death.
The wolves bark with wind in summertime.
As the moon passes the shadows. It was a grim tale.
The wolves pry the limbs from the conquered ones.
Carnage consumes the emptiness.
Wait till my spirits come forth.
Violate all his chosen ones.
Drink the fires of death.

deep inside of him, in his eyes.

He is the wind, He is the storm.
He is the woods, He is the roots.
Nobody will escape the wrath of the Tyrant.
Forever the Beast shall wander the Earth.
Curse you all men
Who's coil is strong
I recognise the sparrows heart
Beneath the theatre of misery
Disbelivers shalt by dawn
Be forced
To forever mourn
Curse you all men
That resent my empire
Cause I have risen again
At war this time
The truth I speak
Is your decease
My word is your defeat
And thou shall not
Be able to hide anymore
The prophecy will
Conquer at last
Your sense of reality
With mission to kill
The theatre of misery
He has risen again
Armed with the source of sin
And as humans shall fade
He shall inherit their strength
Men of the damned;
Your will reluctantly
Secure His eternal victory
Yes, you are indeed the few;
I am the one.
Reason
This demigod
Unto which you cluster
Sacrilege
You sacrifive the purity
Of the air beneath your wings
A slow and painful ritual
To burn the youth you lost
Demigod
Blasphemers walk among your flock
Despite your blindfold
Proudly you carry the stone on your back
Disillusioned
You plant your feet safely to the ground
Demigod
Blasphemers walk among your flock
As the stone
You have become
Not once did you cry
For the lost ones of your world
Your care is limited
To this demigod
Onto which you cluster
Reason
Decrystallize me
Demigod
I do blaspheme
The fallen you condemn
Your heart even free of hate
Yet, scared todeath by their disbelief
To ordinary common sense
And with autumn closing in
Forcing life away
No mercy wil impale your sin
Dead are your tears
I dare you
For I possess the wings of faith
Though, heavy on my shoulders
No measurement can prove their weight
Still, a burden are they not to me
I am the challenger of gravity
The fear is not the fate I seek
My destiny will build upon
The mighty turbulence beyond
If I fall I will rise again
Some of envy
Some of fear
Asmonish by the graves of those who fell
Praise the fool that pure of heart
Leaps off your finger
Into grace
your voice once melted
Into the choir of the fallen ones
I have heard, I have seen
The purity of their song
Your fate embrace
A manifold of angels
I summon thee
From shattered graves
And call upon the wind
Recieve my bow of reverence
Then spread your wings
And fly into oblivion
The land was created
In the name of the chosen
And the waves thrown
For men to see
The one who made men
To be
Prevailed from the source
The waves of fury
Prevailed from the source
Were mine to be
Ordered to destroy and bury
No remorse!
The destiny of the wave
Was not to be found
Nor was I travelling
The deadly sea alone
The sun never rose
And my rose
Was not to be
For what purpose
I gave my return
Is stil standing alone
And as the raven dropped
A feather on me
I was again to be
The chosen one...
Four eyes as two in one
The forward circular view
That never ends
An orbital voyage
Throughout the endless sphere of all
Where time is lost and everything transcends
A graceful presence
At stolen time
As ghosts to the world
Ghosts to the world
For ice, outside, are we apart
As cold and eerie mist to the hand
Ever floating on its course
Towards the heights of shadowland
Thus appear the truly sworn
To be seen
To be feared
Yet, not to be reached
Four eyes as two in one
Thus appear the truly sworn
As ghosts to the world
Thus appear the truly sworn
For ice outside, are we apart
Thus appear the truly sworn
Cold and eerie mist. Burning
Thus appear the truly sworn
A graceful presence
At stolen time
Thus appear the truly sworn
For I speak of purity
I am unconquerable
In my worship
I am invincible
On my crusade
However hard the strikes may be
However deep the wounds
This blood immortal
Bleeds for thee
In every breath I hear
The silent whisper of your name
In every harmony
In every thought
You make my water into wine
Remember
I am ever thine
Blessed was I with the consecration
To indomitable dedication
Two bound as one
In a trinity
Where I comprise
Infinite forms of unity
In unity reborn
To a state
Where all past burdens
No longer shall be worn
I pledge to perfection
No compromise can touch my woe
Nor questions reach my faith
In immortality
All raised
To be men
Given image and path
Supreme
Idolised warriors
Bright steel
Burning rage
Never too late to try
Stand tall
Never plead
Live and let die
I see the spirit
Of those ancestors
And reconsider the faith
A primitive sword
Can not win my war
Cold fury
Flaring eyes
Calculated verbal gun
My pride
Justified
Spiritual steel shines bright
Beyond the sun
The pride of the warrior
Is far from dead
The colours of death
Are still black and red
Though modernised
Blood wil be shed
Ever behind me
Rise a shadow
Taller than I
Yet, with a certain resemblance
How many times
Do I have to contemplate my own reflection
And say; I have been blind?
I have been blind
Yet, I saw the search and dreams
Of my rejection
Walking behind me
Every time
I am bound to have been granted
The gift of better sight
But my anxiety
Built one more brick
Fearing again
To choose the wrong step
Vaguely I remember
The blurred eyes
Of someone small
These strangers often come as blind
A troubled mind
I left behind
Yet, was it I
Of my shadow
Walking in the past?
By the moons, heist, and all of the light
Above the earth he rode
He seeks that which never was
And never to become
The moon rose it was crimson in color
It lighted some coming form
That once crushed so many of them
It ever comes again
And again, and again
The moon shone with a fuller red
Was it cursed to be drawn to the earth?
What once has been shall be no more
Dead in graves is heist
It is in graves
Oh lord I kneel before the secret council
I form these reckonable words of iniquity
For my enemies be against me
And they have led ways for my soul to be consumed
together
Defend me from he that rises up against me
Save me from he that raids our homes and follows my
path below the frozen moon
For he lay in wait for my soul
And desires to take it down a firey pit
Heist descends to the world
Fed alone by our souls
See your perished form
So by the stone it crushed their faith
Their kingdom lost
The moon rose it was crimson in color
To remain
What once crushed so many, alone
It ever comes again
And again, and again
... and after years in dark tunnels
he came to silence
there was nothing...
he realised that the cheering cries of worship
were but echoes of his harsh outspoken word
reflecting back at him from cold and naked walls
in hollow circles fled illusions of wisdom he had heard
From nothing came all I ever knew
and he beheld the ruins
of an empire torn apart
yet, no grief nor rage did bind him
just silent and bewildered
by the emptiness
he stumbled off his throne
suddenly, the walls around him cracked wide open
and an endless void appeared in flickering, grey light
What force, but silence, has deprived me of my coil?
No trail to guide me. 
No point of reference in sight.
By nothing, resurrection will be pure.
and he beheld the ruins
of an empire torn apart
wiping dust off his shoulders
just silent now
in this emptiness
leaving all behind
step by step
past all past
slowly he approached the surface
nothing left
to sacrifice
the mirrors mocked him on the way
he looked upon the world
and saw that it was still depraved as him
though not like him
he was already caught within their cycle
with them outside depraved
instinctive rebellion
possessed by bestial despair
he fought this law and broke the spell
So, this is why I built my empire
fled from the truths unto which they conspire
in spirit born a stranger
a counterpart in mind
the seeker raised to bury
a freak among the blind
encountered with mysteries
on his mission to reverse their ways
he sought a life among the dead
with refuge in an endless maze
before the silence
This can not be the purpose of my presence.
What then is the call of my return?
he is an empty shell
shell-shocked luciferian soul
he is an empty shell
drained and sealed
he is an empty shell
penetrating cold
he is an empty shell
empty luciferian soul
how furiously and bombastic
he proclaimed his destruction
of a mortal coil
in the end it seemed
this was his only possession
long past were his glorious days
of filth and lies
and he has reached out to stop time
at its end
he is an empty shell
shell-shocked luciferian heart
he is an empty shell
drained and sealed
he is an empty shell
penetrating cold
he is an empty shell
empty luciferian soul
the constant struggle for a moment of quiet indulgence
eventually stirred and quaked the earth so hard
it swallowed him in a dark and heavy cloud
slowly and gently starving him into insanity
an inferno of ice
with an ever burning
bleeding heart
and as if awaken from eternal sleep
he sought a mentor
for he no longer knew his position
It is time after miracles
and I am its prophet
I have not come to cure
but to bear witness decease
It is the place where blood and soil
lie beyond the boundaries of the sun
and I am its prophet
I cast the shadow
I absorb the light
I am the prophet
I bear witness
I absorb
I cry
As I die
I shall burst wide open
As I die
I shall release the apocalypse
my prophecy
Thus, I hold on to faith
Thus, I keep the hope
That it will prosper
and devour
It is time after miracles
and I am its prophet
I have not come to cure
but to bear witness decease
and pain joined his urge to perceive
teach me the tongue of fire
so that I may set the world ablaze
for it is cold
and this blindness can no longer give me shelter
teach me the tongue of fire
so that I may cry out loud my wrath
and my passion
or else my coil will blister and decay
the soul is never silent
but wordless
held imprisoned
in a cursed tomb
wherein reflections never fade
never die
slowly maddened
by the emptiness
left to perish in the ever-dark coil
yet, always alert it its slumber
scorn by the drops of light
piercing through the surface
and it screams
the soul is never silent
but wordless
teach me the tongue of fire
so that I may set the world ablaze
for it is cold
and this blindness can no longer give me shelter
teach me the tongue of fire
so that I may cry out loud my wrath
and my passion
or else my coil will blister and decay
in the wordless chamber
they feared death
desperately
thus they clustered to the fruits of the earth
craving diversion
as if to avoid knowing why
in the wordless chamber
they feared life
desperately
thus they proclaimed any given truth
and swallowed as if to justify their fear
he knew that there had been hordes of seers before him
who set out to cure
though, the sick wished not to part with
their decease
as if it made them feel alive
in the wordless chamber
he accepted desperation
and the unpredictable manifestations of hope
when all is dark
there are no points of reference
and we no longer navigate
by the stars
we just end up somewhere
nowhere
where lights are dim
and shades of black are grey
time appears like a golden calf
while the moments slip away
a search for the freedom in the future
when the hours fall behind
I can always die another day
desperately I seize tomorrow
all out of my reach
that is what I learned
this is what I teach
corruption seems to flourish
while promises decay
where lights are dim
and shades of black are grey
where lights are dim
and shades of black are grey
from the moment of arrival
we are led astray
with nothing but a distant cry
from deep within a soul
a wordless voice
to guide us on the way
desperately we name the voice
and make the cries our own
as if to deny the fact
that we are all alone
in solitude we mingle
disillusioned we fall prey
where lights are dim
and shades of black are grey
I can always live another day...
and again he came to cherish
the comfort of mysteries
inspiring and far away
timeless in the moment
they painted immortality
forever drawn towards the centre
of this ensorcelling flame
yet, still in fear of the sacrifice
it would take to know its name
Do not despair, said the mystery
You will always have a friend in me
until the day you break my code
then I will be gone and you are free...
...to manifest another
towards the heavens he did aspire
now he shall burn who sought the fire
some will mourn the ashes cold
while others behold the inferno unfold
forever drawn towards the centre
of this ensorcelling flame
yet, still in fear of the sacrifice
it would take to know its name
now he shall burn who sought the fire
to manifest another
I hereby commit my body to the ground
sterilised and wrapped in plastic foil
being an object of this space and time
this body should remain concealed
for it holds every disease
ever exposed
it holds all pain and death
I could ever unleash
beneath deceiving, fragile skin
breathes the ever growing hate within
since the first glimpse of my existence
I have fed this greedy infection
an aimless search for potential persistence
found no escape from the fatal injection of life
for it holds every disease
ever exposed
it holds all pain and death
it could ever unleash
beneath deceiving, fragile skin
breathes the ever growing hate within
I am the father
I am the son
my refugee soul has escaped
this body depraved
of final wishes I ask none
but one
now that I am gone
lay thorns on my grave
Buried beneath the mountains of frost
Years of silent sorrow grim and dark
My winterwings of evil sleep in eternal nights
In death's cold crypts of snow
The moon chimed my return
With black storms I came
And not with the winds
The Northern darkness marches through the coldest night
I can't resist the taste from the winds of the moon
I split my tongue for the taste of these winds
And bath my eyes in its grace
Frost and winter return to my eyes
The call of the wintermoon
Nocturnal clouds blow freely in the distance
In the gray mist of death's horizon
My winter wings of evil sleeps
In death's cold crypts of snow
Buried beneath the mountains of frost
Years of silent sorrow grim and dark
Into eternal nights
Hearing the call of the wintermoon
Northern darkness marches
Through the coldest night
I can't resist the taste from the winds of the moon
I split my tongue for the taste of these winds
And bath my eyes in its grace
Frost and winter return to my eyes
The call of the wintermoon
The call of the winter moon
In the Northern tribe!
The moon chimed my return
Hearing the call of the wintermoon
Slowly crossing
As red rivers runs below
Forever passing
Where darkness lies unknown
Where soulwinds burns my eyes
Where shadows of lost life hides
Enter the centers of darkness
Where all evil dwells
Demons present in flames
Oath of black souls found
Sacrifices as old as the earth
We cut the living flesh
Circles of the deepest black throne
A promise of the darkest blood found
Unholy forces of evil
Unholy forces of hell
It's delicious
The demons, rising again
It's delicious
A mayhemic silence floats
We await our signs of death our circle's gathered
Ceremonial powers belong to us
A goat baptized in fire
We dance the circle dance on thorns
On thorns
Awaiting the sign of the horns
A thousand black clouds storm
Blasphemous Northern rites
Mysticism touched
Pentagrams burning
Into the centers of darkness
Where all evil dwells
Demons present in flames
Oath of black souls found
Unholy forces of evil
Unholy forces of Hell
It's delicious
The demons, rising again
Unholy forces of evil
Served upon our diabolical souls
Cults of death bathed in slaught
As the devil's candles burns
Into the dark skies
Floating with the soulwinds of the pentagram
To the deathlights where the North star awaits
Black sunset rises
Under the funeral sky
The freezing waters below
As mirrors made of funeral mist
But the blasting sky above
And the fullmoon is on the rise
Fullmoon’s on the rise
My hair blows in the winds of reap
Still I float with the cold diabolical massacre winds
On the bestial wings of evil
Above the mountainside
And into cryptic winterstorms
I long for eternal frost and black winters
Asleep in the cold lakes
Awake in the stars in the sky
And silent the valleys in the North
Where I once were a proud warrior
Where I belong
Where I bath my soul in doom fire fog
Where I ride death's cold winds
In the battles in the North
As Norse warriors I rode the dark valleys
With long sword in hand
Sworn to throne the dark lands
To return to my masters
In the blue mist of the dying sunset
Black sunset dies
Under the funeral sky
My hair blows
In the winds of reap
Still I float
With the cold diabolical massacre winds
On the overshadowed
Bestial wings of evil
Above the mountainside
And into cryptic winterstorms
Forever
Under a blood red moon in the cold lakes of Thule
Where wintershadows lies untouched
Where I dwell at the mountains of madness
In these shadows of death I march
In the blue mist of evil
Through the dark Northern valleys
Where only winds of funeral breathe
Hovering through the whispering darkness
With frost in my eyes
Only seven winds are heard
Chiming through the dark Northern valleys
Eternity I pass
Eternity I seek
For the darkness my spirit
For satan my black soul
Under a blood red moon in the cold lakes of another world
Where wintershadows lies untouched
Where I dwell at the mountains of madness
Entering with the cold winds of funeral dust
Out in the black night
Cold Northern breeze
Under the red skies
Surrounded by blasphemous winds
Midnight passing and the moon is fulfilled
Slowly blackening the sky
I summon up where the ravens fly high
Towards the moon of Blashyrkh
Death rides on black wings
Evil enter the sky
Angels fall from the heavens
While the darkness shines through
Chariots of the darkest masters
Arrives on devil wings
Heaven's angels surrounded by fog
Forced into the holocaust frozen clouds
A twisted wind
Rapes the clouds
Memories of cold days
And lightning return
Blacker than Darkness
Blacker than Darkness
A foggy fullmoon night
Into darkness rides
Under the horned goat-moon
As dark as black rivers at wintertime
December moon come to me
I ride the wings of Torment
Blacker than darkness
Winter of the ages so dark so cold
That flames turn into the bluest frost
Mountains of ice
Rises above a dead and frozen ground
The ravens return to the hills
And the Millennium black bells of eternal frost
Chime to the Northern lightning
Upon the mountainside I stand
The floods of black runs below
Hair of a cold goatscalp I kiss
Eyes taken mountain still breathes at one
To the poisoned ground
Midnight darksky open up
A blast of red lightning rides the night
With doom winds death's angels fly
Across a nearly closed skyline
And the sun freezes at one
With the infernal holocaust frozen clouds
Centuries of doom reigned by the Goatthrone of desire
Raised by sorcery to the Holocaust sky
North black hordes storm
Through invincible cyclones of frostwinds
I lift my hands
And join the ceremonial circle of one wind
Eye of stone now sleep
Into eternal nights
This winter is forever
A wind of red I rode
A wind of evil cold
For the years that have passed in the North
Brought me visions of the Goatthrone of desire
On the hillside where I stood left for another world
Tragedies blows at horizon
The sun freezes to dust
A perfect vision of the rising Northland
Delight of the moon
Is burning inside
Spiritless I lay
On cryptic stones
Mesmerizing snow
Wait silent above me
And my yearning for frost
Grow strongly
I'm a demon
A demon with a shadowed face
Entering to my winter coffin
Awaiting to see the dawnless realms
Staring into a ground of glass
A perfect view
I could have fallen to my eyes
I'm a demon
A demon with a shadowed face
Entering to my wintercoffin
Awaiting to see the dawnless realms
Staring into a ground of glass
A perfect view
I could have fallen to my eyes
Unsilent storms in the north abyss.
Unsilent storms in the north abyss.
Gathering the horde on a mountainside
Awaiting the mourning bestial sunrise
Diabolic seven winds of hate breathe
In the chasm of the realms
In clouds above horizon
A throne of ice
Watching silently
With a warrior's eye
Winds of destruction fills our hearts with joy
Portals to war lay before us
Fog in the distance is all I see
Born of the blackening sky of Blashyrkh
A raven's claw lifted toward the sky
In a sign for the norse hordes to ride
A sign for the norse hordes to ride
Is the way for our enemies to die
In The Mist Of The Twilight
You Could See Me Come
To Walk The Endless Woods Alone
The Earth Is Freezing
As I Walk It Become Colder.
Forever Descending In A Place Of The Moon
Where Shadows Move With Grotesque Eyes
Where Demons Rise
Surrounded By Black And Mourning Moonfog
And The Eyes Of The Dark Ones
Sempiternal Woods Wait Only For Me
A Path Opens Clearly
The Sun No Longer Rises
Over Cold And Forgotten Valleys
The Sun No Longer Rises
Where I Walk And Where I Come
I Believe In Tragedies
I Believe In Desecration
To The North And Into Eternal Winters
To The North In The Grip Of Eternal Frost
A Whispering Cry
Heard from a casket of stone
Sorrow Reap The Windscreen
I'm here all alone
Shades of gray cast to the sky
In The Deepest Night
Icewinds tears drips
On my unbeloved soul
Coven of black mist
Sing for me
Ceremonial hymns
Of the purest blasphemy
At one with the Earth
Alone with light in my eyes
The ravens circle around my tomb
As I dream the night
Coven of black mist sing for me
Coven Of Black Mist Sing For Me
Ceremonial hymns
Of the purest blasphemy
At One With The Earth
Alone With Light In My Eyes
The Ravens Circle Around My Tomb
As I Dream The Night
Frozen By Icewinds
Sons Of Northern Darkness
Under The Throne Of The Moon
United With Forces Of Evil
And Infernal Doom
Lords Of Tragedies Storm
As the valley gates opens
Decayed lands of sorrow
Wait below
Wait below
Storming through red clouds
Storming Through Red Clouds
Blades in eyes shinning
Eyes in blades shinning
Sons of Northern Darkness
Under The Throne Of The Moon
United With Forces Of Evil
And Infernal Doom
Storming through red clouds
Storming Through Red Clouds
Demonized by the closing Nordic lights
Enshrined on the burial ground
On the path to the cemetary gates
My grave sank in the rivers
To the cemetary pit
Spiritual voices called through chilling smoke
Frozen visions of a dying realm
Under a blasting winter sky
Hate rises from an infernal tomb
A shadow with black wings
Eternal years on the path to the cemetary gates
In the chains of cold with hate to all
Eternity surround me I am real as the earth
As dark winds fade away no one knows where I am gone
Enshrined on the burial ground
On the path to the cemetary gates
My grave sank in the rivers
To the cemetary pit
Spiritual voices called through chilling smoke
Tasting the cold from the shining gates
As snow falls from the sky
Thirsting for the realms of frost
At the end of the other side
I won't stop but spread my wings
As dark winds fade away no one knows where I am gone
Eternal years on the path to the cemetary gates
In an hour of the night I hear summoning voices
And wake from my funeral sleep
In time before light in crypts of eternal deep
Dust from my grave blew away with the wind
On a cryptic journey unto the other side
Beneath the mountain and passed beyond the gate below
The eternity opens
Floating evil reign with fear in the sarcastic caves
Enlightened into a blacker dark for there are views in darkness
The light is searching to save the soul of mine
It is blind and can't see the gate to immortality
Harnessbells hail my soul
The gate is all I've known
The eternity opens
Floating evil reign
With fear in the sarcastic caves
Enlightened into a blacker dark
For there are views in darkness
The light will disappear
It was never here
As the eternity opens
Floating evil reign
With fear in the sarcastic caves
Enlightened into a blacker dark
For there are views in darkness
As the eternity opens
Light will disappear
It was never here
As the eternity opens
Light will disappear
It was never here
As the eternity opens
The mighty sound of damnation calls
As holocaust sky draw near
Above the storms over Baeskades
Rule the power of the vrilla
It's come to ride the seven winters
With winds of war and winds of cold
Lightning strike the northland
Leading us into seasons of frost
Stand in fog with so cold a heart
Watching the death of the sun
Valleys abound a thousand of coffins
The holocaust has just begun
It's the march of the blasphemous masses
Into damnation all will fall
Chapels of black unholy demons
Chanting the words of the funeral rites
Pure holocaust!
Chanting words of funeral rites
Chapels of black unholy demons
Into damnation all will fall
It's the march of the blasphemous masses
The holocaust's just begun
Valleys abound a thousand of coffins
Watching the death of the sun
Stand in fog with so cold a heart
Leading us into seasons of frost
Lightning strikes the Northland
Winds of war and winds of cold
It's come to ride the seven winters
Rule the power of the Vrilla
Above the storms on Baeskades
As the holocaust sky draw near
The mighty sound of damnation calls
Pure holocaust
Come forth demonized
Under the banner of Blashyrkh we ride
In the battle sky we lie estranged
Kings of the ravenrealm
We trample bejeweled thrones of the Earth
In an age undreamed of
Viewing myriad battles
Yet our eyes sparkling strident with strength
To trample bejeweled thrones of the Earth
In an age undreamed of
The ones to sit upon the elder throne
With shadowed faces for the coming centuries
Riding towards the masterfields
A ride from the North to the North
By our sacred ravens we are one
In the deadwhite moonlight
Far above is we reign mercilessly
Kings of the ravenrealm
Stronger than ice, stronger than stone
A horde of heathenhearts to come
Battles, battles in the North
Battles, battles in the North
Those who adhere to principle above battle lust
Sing your songs with dying breath
Come forth demonized
Under the banner of Blashyrkh we ride
In the battle sky we lie estranged
Kings of the raven realm
We trample bejeweled thrones of the Earth
In an age undreamed of
Seeing myriad battles
Yet our eyes sparkling strident with strength
We trample
Those who adhere to principle above battle lust
Sing your songs with dying breath
For the Kings of the Raven Realms!
Battles, battles in the North
Battles, battles in the North
Frostbitten I became
Forthwith to see
Crystallized dimensions
To where the unfaithful fly
You might say
I'm demonized
yet not the only one
You must come to me
There are nocturnal paths
To follow
Painted faces
From earlier centuries
Wander by desecrating winds
Blinded shadows
Cast out from daylight
And from the beaten lands
Frostbitten I became
Forthwith to see
Crystallized dimensions
To where the unfaithful fly
You might say
I'm demonized
yet not the only one
You must come to me
There are nocturnal paths to follow
Enjoying the circling of eminent silence
Amidst the glacial abyss
Join my yearning emptiness
The knowing of being beneath
Grim and frostbitten kingdoms
Standing in ringwalls of stone
Deepest dungeons
Pass iron gates
Nor the golden sent dreams
Under towers
That once stormed in sight
That never storm
Hill
To the elder ravens
On Bergs laid in fog
Forget not the blasphemic
North deeps
Shadows steal our souls
Into what we once were
I’m feeling they’re taking us there
Closed in time
For those who shall not pass our gates
In circles concentric against the Earth
I enthrone my spiritworlds
Obviously of frost shall be
Blizzard beasts encompassing me
To vipe the faces of the Earth
In memorial to the ones with pride
Glance of day shall never shine
These realms are mine
Master of nebulah frost
Await the solar fall
Creations of ice shall behold
Wings majestic funereal
Guide through spectral lands
None shall pass me there
Hidden within churning chasms of an elder age
Come the mighty sons of dawn
Shadows of aurora
A time for pure holocaust to rise
Decades a thousand fold
In circles concentric against the Earth
I enthrone my spiritworlds
Obviously of frost shall be
Blizzard beasts encompassing me
To vipe the faces of the Earth
In memorial to the one with pride
And glance of day shall never shine
For these realms are mine
Still-breathing valleys
Made birth to the beasts
From the throne of the north
Throned by blackstorms
Creations of ice shall behold
Wings majestic funereal
Guide through spectral lands
None shall pass me there
Throned by blackstorms
Moonrise fields of sorrow
Our mighty fathers fell
Mountain watches memories
Dark shining past
Laid in frost below a bleak sun
Under icicled paths
Mighty were the fathers of Norse men
And in us they shall return
Shine for me fields of sorrow
Shine for me dread moon
And make me never-ending snowfall
Moonrise fields of sorrow
Moonrise fields of sorrow
Shine for me fields of sorrow
Shine for me dread moon
And make me never-ending snowfall
Laid in frost below a bleak sun
Under icicled paths
Mighty were the fathers of Norse men
And in us they shall return
Begun to me never-ending snowfall
Eyeless in eternal time
For I’ve worn the moonshine
Burning away the daylight glimmer
With my nocturnal senses
Winds have come for me
Winds will come to me
Descending now
Towards the frost moon eclipse
A spectral spirit kingdom rises
In storm screens covered by ice
Night emits its shadow
And there’s no difference between ravens
They have come for me
They will come to me
To the cursed realms of the winterdemons
Lavender eyes had only known the under dark
From the crypts of stone they ride beyond the blinding glare
Eyeless in eternal time
For I’ve worn the moonshine
Burning away the daylight glimmer
With my nocturnal senses
Winds have come for me
Winds will come to me
Descending now towards
The frostmoon eclipse
Out from the chambers
The horizon will be open for me
To the face of the Earth will know this black silence
For I saw them march
For the lights
Endless tall mountainside
Gates to open wide
Lands of dragon birth
Sorrow always rain
On a frosty path to sorrow
Guarded by unearthly beasts
Darkening memories claim
That winter never dies
Bad moons enshrined
In the heart
Northern Darkness
Walk with me hand in hand
At the stormy gates of mist
On a frosty path to sorrow
Guarded by unearthly beasts
Darkening memories claim
That winter never dies
With bad moons enshrined in the heart
Northern darkness walks
With me hand in hand
Endless tall mountainside
Gates to open wide
Land of dragonbirths
Sorrow always rain
What wait eternity in Permafrost
Views that eyes can never bear
At the stormy gates of mist
I’m still standing
In storm I ride towards shadow ruins
Infernally vasts take my sight
Took color my vision
From an endless dripping sky
Paint the visage centuries old
Of those that ride by my side
The hovering steel desecrators
Nearer have I never been
To this I always searched
Crystal-clear opening
In which I shall be gone
From an endless dripping sky
Cryptic visages centuries old
Of those that rode by my side
In storm I stand upon the ruins
Infernally vasts take my sight again
The light is dim before me
For vision was frost
For vision was frost
Chiming bells of immortality
Sing through the halls of eternity
In time when dragons sprang out from the Earth
I was at one with a blackening moonlit
And from a Berg to the open sky
I saw a raven circle
Born out of thorns to the surface world
Mesmerizing strength
To fly among the blackest rain
And soar into the deepest gorge
For this I would battle kingly palaces
For they learn to be false
And outshine it all that I once knew
Circling above the open sky
To fly among the blackest rain
In the under dark
To soar into the deepest gorge
In time when dragons sprang out from the Earth
I was at one with a blackening moonlit
From a Berg to the open sky
I saw a raven circle
Circling
Circling above in time before time
far above the ravengate
The spread wings of Blashyrkh wait
Above the roaring depths
Sits the oath of frost on the elder Raven Throne
Older mountains sleeping in my sight
By chilling woods I stand
A grimly sound of naked winds
Is all that it shall ever be heard from here
Winters await...
Seasonal...
Dying suns descend...
Ageless...
Demonized...
The Wind Valley...
Wintriness lurk within enlocked realms
Strength beheld our demon throne
Supernal journeys from the shrine
Beyond the spirit side
Yearning in beast worlds tide
Blackening the lands with blight
Benighted watchers with masterly pride
We rise the demon side
Winters spread by blizzard beasts
Wait no more centuries we have become
Triumphant sons of an ice age blast
Echoes of our shadowed age
Above the winter’s masters rage
Convoke nebular dimensions
As real as the realms we ride
With none above and none at side
Yearning from beast worlds tide
Blackening the lands with might
Benighted watchers with masterly pride
We hold the demon side
Wintriness lurk within enlocked realms
Strength beheld our demon throne
Supernal journeys from the shrine
Beyond the spirit side
Winters spread by blizzard beasts
Convoke nebular dimensions
As real as the realms we ride
With none above and none at side
Damnation call
Final blasts close the earth
Immortal victory
Winters bane upon the masses
Snow spiraling towards aurora clouds
Clear nebulous vision sight
Soul winds fall into the dark ice realms
Where you now reach far
Black-winged ravens cry for tragedies to come
Lurking with snowfall
By doom they drag the robes of ice
Frozen of heart you now reach far
In the nebular ravens winter
Winds are known from where they blow
Nebular raven winters
Strength comes from us above
Ravens season has begun
Melancholic ageless and unknown
Mesmerized you fall in our domain
Freezing in the heart
Sojourn for the elder ravens
Beauteous winter's birth
An eerie mage
Emblazoned with the biting winds
Damnation calls
With staring glowing yearning eyes
Poised they strike again and drag
Us all below
In the nebular ravens winter
Winds are known from where they blow
Nebular ravens winter
Might bestowed from us above
Ravens season has begun
Melancholic, ageless and unknown
Mesmerized you fall in our domain
Inhale the effluence of demon worlds
Freezing in the heart
Mountain guarded by the light of sun
In the valley that we walk
Dark spirits against the sun
Gathered visioned in the raven storm
Black winged wraiths of opaque dreams
Owners of frost spheres
Unearthly strangeness never sunrise here
Crystalline formations
Ice storms scar the sky
A shadowed face in the wilderness
Knowing winter never dies
Clearly I breathe
In the forthcoming breeze
With tempted eyes I dreamwatch dying suns
I await
Ephemeral suns to fall
Aghast
Light becomes darkness
Black moon calls bleakness inside me
No longer visions
I see the dying suns go under
Suns that sank below
In snowblind visions I let the darkening moon
Become the jewel in my kingdom
Suns that sank below
Smell the battle with the wind
Before you see us
Winter horde of fury ride
The wind will lead us
Banner high onward ride
Domestic purebred
On the ever-lifted north sky
Conquer all with permafrost
Phantasmworlds
Await at our final gate
Lay waste this world on ice
Let it crumble underneath us, underneath us
Ride the breeze of better times
Where there are enemies to die
High fame and honour
Won on the fields of battle
Warriors fight
With long swords in hand
Valleys drink from the open wounds of a thousand men
Hear the battle on the wind
So obvious
Winter horde of fury rides
The wind now lead us
Banner high
Onward we ride
Domestic purebred
On the ever-lifted north sky, north sky
Conquer all with permafrost
Phantasmworlds
Await at our final gate
Lay waste this world on ice
It will crumble underneath us, underneath us
Valleys drink from the open wounds of a thousand men
Eldrich talons eat hearts out of the fallen
Proud with battle lust we ride
Savagely towards the battlefields
And into greater strides
Battlefields awaits
The storm is getting colder
In a place of the frozen sun
Alone on the mountainside
Breathing the clearest winds
The winds are ever blowing
Blowing off the glaciers
Snow descends on the valley
The high impassable drifts
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
So rightly I am watching
These mountains that I know
Standing here
These mountains’ Northern face
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Icicled peaks
As far as the eye can see
I will reign this place alone
Cold winds blew into the valley wall
Snow was deeper there
The storm is getting colder
In a place of the frozen sun
Alone on the mountainside
Breathing the clearest winds
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Shadowed you fall
Iced soul in the shivering sphere
Bestial sound of winter call
Bitter cold comes whispering
Noctambulance spread its wings
Snow-tombed darkness circling
Demons claws in the wind
Rule the ever-lasting souls on ice
Cast for the nebular worlds
Demons of endless time
In the uplifting Aurora Borealis of cold
A trinity of might is born
Up head us masters, demons roar
By glacial utterness we view your spirits
Wind swept forever in the northerly hemisphere
Frozen in the winter gate
Shadowed you fall
Iced soul in the shivering sphere
Bestial sound of winter call
Bitter cold comes whispering
Noctambulance spread its wings
Rule the ever-lasting souls on ice
Cast for the nebular worlds
Demons of endless time
In the uplifting Aurora Borealis of cold
A trinity of might is born
Up head us masters of demons roar
By glacial utterness we view your spirits
Wind blown forever in the Northerly hemisphere
Stride purposefully through the snow
To the icy vasts at dusk
Crystals swirl by Northern dim
Majestic be this winter
Winter demons winter beasts
Further my visionary means
Blast into dominance
Millenniums filled with pride
Winters of hate winters of pain
Winters of sorrow
These winters await
Nebular fog aurora fog
Await us all in this seasonal cold
I stride purposefully through the snow
To the icy vasts at dusk
Drawn by our will
From the coldest regions
An ice age comes, comes
Minds into the elder dryas
Majestic panorama
Across the lands
Our mark shall flow
Winters of hate
Winters of pain
Winters of sorrow
These winters await
Nebular fog aurora fog
Await us all in this seasonal cold
Winters of hate
Winters of pain
Winters of sorrow
These winters await
Nebular fog
Aurora fog
Await you all to spread in this seasonal cold
Arctic wintry worlds in mind
Possessed forever by the chains of time
Beastly crafts comes with the snow
bring the coming of our demon storm
Mountains
On highest mountains we stand
Valleys in the deep
valleys we dwell
Demon ride
Hailstones flay the skin of earth
Demonized
Entropy’s victory is ensured
Stealers of dawn
Pale wraiths of the arctic swarm
Cover the sun
Storms are what we breathe
Arctic wintry worlds in mind
Possessed forever
By the chains of time
Beastly crafts comes with the snow
We bring the coming
Of our demon storm
Mountains
On highest mountains we stand
Valleys in the deep valleys we dwell
Demon rise
Hailstones flay the skin of earth
Demonized
Entropy’s victory is ensured
Frost demon storms
Darker and darker skylines of red grew my horizon
on the edges of my vision a giant grim-faced realm...
Flaming suns crested the horizon shadows born a cloudless day
believers of the rise and set of the moon darkened twilight into night...
Hardening claws of cold tell me we are closer to colder times
through the days of bitterness still the tundra lay untouched
In the final of that day and all centuries after
in eternity and time the same still the tundra lay untouched
Blacker and blacker blinded by shades from centuries behind
shadows of a dark that used to be under heavy winters reign...
The blackening sky never end as we stand the fall of time
yet winds of cold will always blow without tomorrow...
Hardening claws of cold tell me we are closer to colder times
through the days of bitterness still the tundra lay untouched
In the final of that day and all centuries after
in eternity and time the same still the tundra lay untouched
Believe the sea high waves upon our coming storm
hear the roaring tide as we name a dawn
See the ice in which we craft our souls
earth's frozen cries the dark benight your kind
Monstrously the sea rages afar as if to hide from that which nears
skyward from the sea salt air our vision knew a giant fall
See the ice in which we craft our souls
life's frozen cries the dark benight your kind
A place of utterness beyond the wilderness
through a darkened terrain that fades in emptiness...
Walkers of the dust survivors of the blast
slowly they move but far behind all time into the solarfall...
Believe the sea high waves upon our coming storm
hear the roaring tide as we name a dawn
Monstrously the sea rages afar as if to hide from what which nears
skyward from the sea salt air our vision knew a giant fall
See the ice in which we craft our souls
all frozen cries the dark benight your kind
The last sunset flame dust of ice drifts the earth
lightning plays in depths of no rebirth...
A black day dawn at horizon where winter hearts our battlefields
the ultimate frost age desire snow flurry drifts these plains
Since the blast of primaries we've conquered against the storm
throning with will and the sound of battle never ends...
Tragedies blows at horizon
we ride as one our battle rages on...
Tragedies blows at horizon
we die as one our battle rages on...
Thundering columns of fire majestic against the breeze
Gleaming my scepter at hand the wind altogether silent
Frozen of heart awaken from a time and risen
By the dying evening breeze
The sound of battle never ends
Tragedies blows at horizon
we ride as one our battle rages on...
Tragedies blows at horizon
we die as one our battle rages on...
Barbaric tempered steel strike forth and toll our days
the red and black of our Victorian crest
We flag beneath... 
beneath the solar seas
we grant us the might to conquer so spread be our wrath...
Meet the voice, the voice of us dark-blinded souls as it blasts from an open sky
victorious, victorious we live over all strong men under us fall
The longer we ride this yearning will make us find
where dark and light don't differ...
where dark and light don't differ...
Winterized... 
blackening descend
Mesmerized... 
into demon land
Far... far and further away
in mightful strong and mindless realms
We flag beneath... 
beneath the solar seas
again it's time to conquer so spread be our wrath...
Where dark and light don't differ...
where dark and light don't differ...
Winterized... 
blackening descent
Mesmerized... 
into demon land
The longer we ride the stronger we stride...
wait for me your deepest realms I'll find
with songs that sound eternally for you my call is ever so strong...
Winter landscapes pure and clear a walk into the glacial valleys
deep under forests alive only my torches fire light...
your realms ever splendid
songs were made eternally the call is ever so strong...
Blashyrkh mighty be your name victorious a kingdom we made
with strength and pride all the way you are at the heart of winter
As the face of a glacier your mountains tower against the sunset
unforgetting what was made a bond so strong and ever so real...
The statue watches the kingdom your giant wings make all beneath
I'm staring forth the raven throne I know I'm at the heart of winter...
Farewell... lengthening pain inside me
Harnessbells... I hear them calling me
A demon... watch my walk in snow
Remain... my years of silent sorrow
Dome in the sky black winds to taste
shadowed spirits lead my way...
Drifting everly alone years of silent sorrow
until I'm home...
Bitterness with bitterness you bitter me...
Emptiness with emptiness you empty me...
Darkness with darkness you darkened me
this journey black before me...
Farewell... nothing breathes within me
Harnessbells... sounding cold behind me
A demon... with frozen eyes opened
this journey black behind me...
Dome in the sky black winds to taste
shadowed spirits lead my way...
Drifting everly alone years of silent sorrow
until I'm home...
It's dark time
Darker than all days before
Darker than all years before
It's cold age
Colder than all days before
Colder than all years before
Taste a tide
Where landscapes surround us with blight
On the wind-rippled steps
The ever-flowing streams of our enemies' blood run cold
A strong ride
Stronger than all days before
Stronger than all years before
Might and pride
Mightier than all days before
Mightier than all years before
Come taste a tide
Where demons play the mind
On the wind-rippled steps
The ever-flowing streams of our enemies' blood run cold
Blow the horn for our tide to come
Triumph
Our battle will be won
Battle all the lands
It's the triumph of the ages
Empire fall by my hands
It's the triumph of the ages
Black demonic hordes
Journey against the earth
Coming from the North
Speeding on a gathering wind
dark time
Darker than all days before
Darker than all years before
cold age
Colder than all days before
Colder than all years before
Come taste a tide
Where landscapes surround us with blight
On the wind-rippled steps
The ever-flowing streams of our enemies' blood run cold
Cold
Again from above the gate we stride at hand
Leading the charge into the battle
Ravaging the lands
Shadows flow on the wind-rippled steps
Our black eyes sparkle
Celebrating death
Again from beyond our realm we come forth
The moon is setting on
Swallowing the sun
Shades gather on the tundra
Ascend from the gods
Who once walked the earth
Before the might of our wrath
Hear the mighty sound of damnation
Of dust all lands will lay in a savage of chaos
Before the menace
Strike you all by the blaze of the glorious victories
Before battalions storm you all
Hear the mighty sound of damnation
Again from above the gate we stride at hand
Leading the charge into the battle
Ravaging the lands
Shadows flow on the wind-rippled steps
Our black eyes sparkle
Celebrating death
The arctic views its distant vast
And the shifting breeze that blew my horizon
Where storm clouds mass along the skies
Dark and brooding across the blistered broken lands
Here flow long streams of freezing water
as in a saga it lived once
Descended to the brinks that tower to the sky
Sound my crying through creation
Still I'm enlocked on these ridges
Where the sun forever vanished
Once a world was ever splendid
That took my soul
Now the world is too old
So take me biting winds
My soul travels with a black heart
When the darkness close in on me
There's this world where I can breathe
Still the saga, the saga will live on
And the breeze that blew my horizon
Behind these waves of ice...
Eyes of stone
Eyes of ice are watching me
Their glimpsing light comes in my sleep
Chained in a dream from the ancient deeps
Mind-travelling the darkest paths
Eyes of stone
Eyes of ice are haunting me
Their burning light comes in the night
Awaken from a dream but still I'm in
Mind-travelling the darkest paths
Come with me
I promise you the darkest desires
Come with me
I promise you a dimension that's higher
Follow me through the unending
On a path where crystals breathe
And night and day are same
Enter to a grimmer dark for us to be
Eyes of stone
Eyes of ice are watching me
Their glimpsing light comes in my sleep
Chained in a dream from the ancient deeps
Mind-travelling the darkest paths
Come with me
I promise you the darkest desires
Come with me
I promise you a dimension that’s higher
Follow me through the unending
On a path where crystals breathe
And night and day are same
Enter to a grimmer dark
For us to be
For us to be
Blackened earth before me
Creeping fog in my way
Lurking through the shadows of another day
My heart's the darkened one
My soul on ice
Into the world beneath me
I stalk the night
Blind me moons above me
But still I shall see
In my time of wandering
Winter it will be
I'm getting nearer
The higher mountains wait
It's getting colder
Snow blow in my face
In our great winter's land
There's seldom sun in sight
In great king winter's land
I hear clear voices of ice
Through the biting wind
At the cold northern mountains
Horizon in wintry dreams
At the cold northern mountains
Cover the horizon
But still I shall reach
The unending darkness that embraces me
Blackened earth before me
Creeping fog in my way
Lurking through the shadows of another day
My heart's the darkened one
My soul on ice
Into the world beneath me
I stalk the night
Where the great winds blow
An ancient tide spills forth
Remember our diabolical past
Summoned by the call of the dark
Only in dark and sinister shadows
My thoughts come clear
And the voice on my mind sound oh so real
The years of memory pass
In our mystic visions blest
Where the ground shudders wind
And the world shakes and roar
Our ghastly souls are one
In our mystic visions blest
Forever
Never bury the years that are gone
Our ghastly souls are one
Here we go again
Where the great winds blow
An ancient tide spills forth
Here we made diabolical pacts
Summoned by the call of the dark
March of the black dungeon ones
Beyond the dim they shape
March of the black demonic ones
Beyond the dim they lurk
March of the black awakened beasts
Beyond the dim they rage
Hordes of evil march
Until the end you fall
Drawn to the apocalypse
It's the age of ending
Damned in black
Damned in black
The ghastly rivers whirl
Swallowing all in sight
Come the vision we await
Into the blinding depths
And never to return...
Damned in black
And never to return
Damned in black
March of the black dungeon ones
Beyond the dim they shape
March of the brave
Immortal gods
From beyond the dim we rise...
Aeons ago the legends tell we rode onward
Led astray by the northern chaos gods
Calm before the storm we came from the north...
Horses roamed in the open landscapes
Scald sang to their kings
Only he who battle wins
Scald sang to the kings
Let the battle be fought to be won
Tremble with fear for the banner of our kings
War now calls, heed to the battle
Hear our swords clinging in the wind
Men cast from their saddles horses, roar and scream
Descendants of wrath and the kingdom of fear...
The might we possess burn like fire
The will remain in our northern hearts...
More scalps to be won, an eye for an eye
Aeons ago the legends tell we rode onward
Led astray by the northern chaos gods
One by one by the northern tribe you fall
One by one... die by the strongest of them all
Still there's only greatness sung to those whom fell
Who battled strong to win these wars...
One by one we took your lives
Grey mist swirl across the meadows...
Where battle once ruled the steps
Where the ancient armours of bronze
Are buried and corroded by time
Strong were those who won the war...
And the legends tell only of wrath
As brothers of the northern tribes...
They guarded the borders of chaos
We leave this battlefield ground
Red were the rivers of blood
Unforgotten by the ones...
Born of strength and glory
Tremble with fear for the banner of our kings
War now calls, heed to the battle
Hear our swords clinging in the wind
Men cast from their saddles horses, roar and scream
Riding through the black fires of endless time
The icy dawn lifts with an horizon like nordens on fire
Still peace breathes throughout the realm...
This ride will be the one...
The morning sun gleam upon these peaceful plains...
Far beyond the realms of fire and ice
The legions marches on...
Now blow the mighty horns of war
Fly throughout the sky... 
set fire to the land
Fly throughout the sky... 
Sons of Northern Darkness
Anger rideth with the one that knows no fear
Whose eyes like fire, whose heart's like ice
And spirit rides with the ones that know no fear
They were the Sons, the Sons of northern darkness
Wisdom rides with the ones that know no fear
As old as the northern wind blow
Blow over grim moors...
Come on!
Gathered we all storm the land...
The sound of triumph in the air
The legions marches on...
Now hear the mighty battle blasts
Fly throughout the sky... 
set fire to the land
Fly throughout the sky... 
Sons of northern darkness
Armoured horses
Gloves of steel
Silver blades
Time to reveal
We're the tyrants that guard the land
Proud upon our gilded thrones
Servants of our great ancestors
Who guarded the gates to infinity
Once kings of shadows
On these blackened fields
All might and domination
Ruled the realms of the above
In conquerable walls...
Weapon of might
Splendour and nobility...
Barbaric times
We're the tyrants that guard the land
Proud upon our gilded thrones
The kings at hold
On their throne
Immortal and invincible
The might lives on
Armies hovered across the land
At the end of the world roll the rivers of red
Beyond that has no man been
We’re the tyrants
We’re the tyrants
Armoured horses
Gloves of steel
Silver blades
Time to reveal
We're the tyrants that guard the land
Proud upon our gilded thrones
Moments of time roll
Deep within the mind
Thoughts roam free and endless
Remembering the tyrants time
We’re the tyrants
We’re the tyrants
Black upon the throne forever
Devilish to be
Haunting in the voids
Somewhere only demons breathe
Black upon the throne forever
Demonic to be
With eyes that possess us
Dare you to connect us
Communing with spirits
And souls of the beyond
Cursed in black
Summoned here within
Black upon the throne forever
Never to return
Lurking in the caves
Blacker than darkness itself
Face us
By the damned in black you fall
Speeding with death's wind
Through the gates of the beyond
Red has marked us pure and evil
Black spirits haunt from here
The frozen squad descend
Demonium
The flame burn within
Death rides on demon wings...
Black spirits haunt from here
The frozen squad descend
Demonium
Demons until the end
Until the end
The dark night landscapes and only me
Seas and rivers high
Deeps and waterfalls
Massive mountains
Powerful mountains
Only me
Where bergs and peaks throne
Cold beneath the moon
The dark night's horizons and only me
The shunning moonlit lights
The paths to forests wild
Massive sky powerful sky
And only me
Epic and diabolic swallowing the gloom
At the works of my gods
I glaze my heart to be
The nature of dark
Awake my soul to see
At the works of my gods
I glaze my heart to be
With an evil mind
Flamed my heart will be
My quest reverse the time within the dark mind
Strength in it I find within the dark mind
The dark mind landscapes and only me
Walls of time benight
A world I realized
Massive thoughts powerful thoughts
Still only me
A deepening of a shadow
By the dimming of the sun
At the works of my gods, I glaze my heart to be
With an evil mind flamed my heart will be
My quest reverse the time within the dark mind
Strength in it I find within the dark mind
Forth after the dark
A time I do know
In my kingdom
I enter to my own world
Open the gate of a mountain of dark
Rising with the shadows
A dark world made for me
Black my mind
Black my heart
In my kingdom
I enter to my own world
Open the gate of a mountain of black
Rising with the shadows
A black world made for me
In my kingdom cold
At the mountains of madness
Unending grimness
On these mountains which I heart
In my kingdom cold
At the mountains of madness
Unending grimness
This kingdom is mine
Frozen and cold.
An existence I do know
In my kingdom cold I enter this condition
Open the gate
That’s a mountain of ice
Rising with the shadows.
A cold world made for me
A cold world made for me
Forth after dark
A time I do know
In my kingdom I enter to my own world
Open the gate of a mountain of dark
Rising with the shadows
A world truly made for me
And here we go again
In my kingdom cold
At the mountains of madness
Unending grimness
On these mountains which I heart
In my kingdom cold
At the mountains of madness
Unending grimness
This kingdom is mine...
This kingdom is mine
Gaping in the horizon
An entire continent cloaked on ice
With giant ice sheets constantly on the move
Seas of this continent so cold and invincible
Where icebergs move as monuments
Towards a dry damned earth
Behind the gates and the mighty portal
Of the arctic polar circle
Builds the frozen, the frozen layers of snow
A perfect platform to grow against the seasons
Towering in the horizon
An entire continent cloaked on ice
With giant ice sheets floating nearer
With its tide and icy waves, waves
Snow belts of Antarctica rise
With its dark polar winter storms
The shadow of Antarctica spreads
With its masses of permafrost
The clima shifts to colder for the older age
Glaciers stretching far washing everything away
The darkest face of ice
The coldest place of all
Massive and unconquerable
Its drama will unfold
On many ships I have sailed
Far beyond the north waves
On the high northern seas
We have found our way
The shadowing voices of our gods
Singing on the calling wind
Where the cold waves
And the longboats brought us far
The saga of the warriors from Northland
Speak of greatness and strength
The saga of the warriors from Northland
Are the saga of many great of men
On the seas against the open
We travelled on and on
Through the raging winds
And storms we arrived
The shadowing voices of our gods
Singing on the calling wind
Where the cold waves
And the longboats brought us far
With sword in hand I now stand
On my enemy's land
And with a northern heart
I will fight until the day I die, die
My time will be remembered
My time it will be known
By my sons, by my tribe
And by the sun, the sea and moon
For he who battled for his land,
His pride and for his men
Shall be remembered and stand eternally named
In the legends of our land
In the legends of our land
Breathing in winds
From the essence of a roaring horizon
Breathing in winds
From the cold sea
Call the shores of the north
Storming the borders of chaos
For the cause of a battle once strong
Faster than the wind we rode
To where our blackened hordes dawned
Armed in the fires of combat
The end will come fast on this day
Stronger than the gods we fought
Triumphant for the dark prophecies
Besiege the thrones of reverence
Gods of all fiery fate
Besiege the thrones of reverence
Warriors crowned this day
All shall fall
The dark tales wrath, bred of steel
An allegiance of great tyranny at the hand of darkness
A force to rule above all so that those who with pride
Lust and will eager to stride
Rise those who despise the weak
Spare none and ride proudly on the winds of death
All defeated by our call, all defeated by our war
Under the hovering thunders of Darkness
All shall fall
Storm forth through battle of fury
All giant warrior be
Blacker than the winds of death
Stronghold and fear blind the weak
Brought at the borders of chaos
For the cause of a battle once strong
Faster than the wind we rode
To where our blackened hordes dawned
Besiege the thrones of reverence
Gods of all fiery fate
Besiege the thrones of reverence
Warriors crowned this day
The rising moon so bleak and old
Its darkened grin poisons my soul
Mist pledges the darkness, be my home
I ride this night
lustful with pride
The lurking mist appears out here
Breaths of evil fire through the snow
This cloudless night smells of fear
Keep my soul
dark and cold
The rise of darkness in my sight
Black forces bound to the moon
Shadows creep under my skin
Smell of fear
darkness is here
All evil lurk under bleak skies
Undead and restless are their souls
Hatred lust aligned by the signs
Blackened night
darkness rise
Burning eyes watching upon me
From the dark haunting side
Caught between mighty winds
Kingdom of evil find
Demonic in this realm
I haunt marked by the sign
Caught between mighty winds
Kingdom of evil find
From the woods I see the rise of darkness
In its deeps I'm on the other side
From the woods I see the rise of darkness
In its craft I'm on the other side
Gather attack while death march in the sky
Ride through the heavens with power
The hammer of battle pound hard from above
All doomed and damned in death's hour
Armies' formations winged in death's sky
Storming from the other side
Apocalypse dawns at the fiery command
Above the great battle fly
Chaos and fire to deafening sounds
Nearting from the other side
Last march for the battling hordes
Annihilation on the rise
Now proud all watch them by Nordlight we ride
Warrios with cold blazing eyes
Speeding on wind the fierce holocaust rises
Legions of black hold the sky
Hordes of war come storming forth
Coldblooded warriors of holocaust
Death stares out from their blinding fearless eyes
The sign of evil burns inside
Smell of death now as we ride through holocaust
Burning souls fall from the sky
Across the tide of pure apocalypse
Come waving flames to burn you all
Descent from the valley bursting through all
Released now is the black burning sound
Those who oppose shall be eternally destroyed
Black fire burns the horizon
Ravens fly high in the sky
A breeze lifts the fog from the ice
As the winter predicts our fall
The last tide of honour now rises
With greatness and frost in its eye
A pale sun gleams upon the masses
All mountains stand proud in its tall
The winds speed upon our twilight
Thundersnow falls from the sky
Snowstorm that blind upon my eyes
From the clouds of red they are thrown
A thousand miles winter surround us
The dark marches while the world falls
The storm of the millennium rises
In massive size I hear its call
Beast of prey from the north arise
A force of strength none can defy
Unleashed from the gates a giant storm
To an end it all shall come
Mighty deeps of north world call
The power is at hand
Apocalypse brought by will
Scattered winds blow at you all
Bewinged by darkness from the cold
Come the order of chaos
Spread by winter, hate and storms
The final days descend the fall
The worlds ends just as it began
Cold winters claws grips at us all
All to be
not to be revealed
The prophecies' truth upon all
The curse is a force that we onward
Freezing and breathing at us...
No far from the forest abounded
The ravens warn us and call...
Through the storm of storm the Aurora lights
In her swirling skies a wrathlike ice
Born to ride the cold, winds of the North
Cometh to freeze the grounds
Release the arctic swarm to drag us down
Spread its shivering wings, caught us by its cold
With haunting frosty eyes, it journeys fast
The cold will bring the fall
The arctic swarm
Indestructible cold
The arctic swarm a fiend, of frost and ice
Gathering winds that howl in frost lines
Transatlantic travels a moss of cold
Revenge on mankind
Deep cold green seas... 
shivering masses
Winds tide heavy waves
Of continental darkness
Into the ice you see
It devours all
Unbreakable its ice walls are
Aghastic majestic sight
Chaotic apocalypse
A floating storm
On colossal powers
All souls to the frozen world
Into the ice you see
It devours all
Unbreakable its ice walls are
Eyes filled with ice
The arctic swarm
Indestructible cold
A passage in the sky
Its sights so monumental
Tower the mountain range
Pointing towards the Nordlight
Its realm hearts the kings
In the shivering frost
A horn monumental
Portals that throne in the sky
Above mountainsides
Pointing towards the Nordlight
Who dwell as gods of ice
Who rule the final realm
Mount North - the greatest of sights
Mount North - its power and might
Mount North - in the dark can be seen
Mount North - awaiting me
A mountain of dark
To where the mysterious rise
Under its light call the stars
Out here I am cursed to wander
Its realm heart the kings
In the shivering frost
Mount North - on unholy ground
Mount North - blackened abound
Mount North - as far as I see
Mount North - I shall enter thee
Entering the sacred world of might
To where the stormy kingdoms home
Here naked winds blow cold and free
All black and dead on frozen ground
Pass the gate to Blashyrkh worlds
An everburning fire swirls
Here shadows hold a grimly sight
Dark must the eyes that see it be
Elder visions rise
the legends and myths
Once brought before the throne of might
Blacker of worlds
Once I would look upon its grace
With everblowing winds
This realm consumes the light
Rule all that comes to eye
Uphold the might
Gates to Blashyrkh
Profante majestic realm
Unearthly kingdom
Mighty ravendark
With everblowing winds
This realm consumes the light
The gate is open
With endless heights, tall and steep
Here moons at twilight
Above the misty deeps
Graced with eternal nights - ice blown by wind
Forests dark to see - dread naked trees
Battle of gods
Fires beneath the one
Throne on the rise
Sons of the dark
From the mighty mountain we ride
North
Northern chaos gods
North
Northern chaos gods
Shadows arise
As the final prophecies
Blacken the sky
The battle of all
Rage from the mighty mountainside
North
Northern chaos gods
North
Northern chaos gods
Chaos has called its sons
Blackened from beyond
Hordes upon the ice
Where warriors ride through the final winterstorm
From the montainous battleside
Come the echoes of battlecry
Come the wrath of the gods
Fires and battles and blood
The immortal sons and the hordes of Blashyrkh
By the north
Northern chaos gods
North
Northern chaos gods
Once shadows before now by the mighty mountain ride
Daylight all darkened under blood red sky
Thunderous ice, fanfares of old
The hordes of Blashyrkh bow to none
North
Northern chaos gods
North
Northern chaos gods
Out from the gates of the shadows we ride
Unleash the powers of battle and strife
Out from the ice darkness to rise
Under the banner of Blashyrkh we ride
Battle of gods
Fires beneath the one
Throne on the rise
Battle 'em all
Now by the mighty ones you ride
North
Northern chaos gods
North
Northern chaos gods
Hordes of Blashyrkh
Kings of the Ravenrealms
Hordes of Blashyrkh
Sons of northern darkness ride
The sword of thunder and lightning is on the rise
From the north the gods of wrath descend
The storm of war nearing
black in its sign
Now vengeance shall enter again
feared by mortals
Our yearning steel strong hands
Thundering hooves strike above dying men
Down the black valleys aride through the haze
From the mountains
hear battle and death
Affronting all for the absolute rule
Let the battle of evil be won
So shall we triumph to rule above men
From the valleys are soon to be born
A thunderous march
tempest of old
Clangor of swords from the once vengeful ones
The doom of all men is decided from the book of end
Soon ridden down and trampled
Into the dim I ride
I know the dark upon me
Into the dim I ride
the gods of wrath above me
As I into battle ride
The might lives on and the horde of revenge
From the north they sound throughout the sky
Unending fire blast in their eyes
Rising swords on the battlefield held high
Warriors ride on the winds to avenge
Tried by steel to be gods among men
Soon the bleak skies will all blacken again
Shout for victory shall never end

Far beneath the blackened sun
mountains they rise
Far beneath the blackened sun
thunder the ice
Here reign the wicked realm
under cold open sky
Frostbitten world of utter dark Blashyrkh Unlight
Far on thy reign
Gods as we ride
Kingdoms of black
To where ravens fly
Far beneath the sky of ice
kingdoms they rule
Far beneath the sky of ice
winter and snow
Here within my wicked realm
open the gates
Throne of winterstorms I heart Blashyrkh Awaits
Far on thy reign
Gods as we ride
Kingdoms of black
To where ravens fly
Above the snow rise
frostcovered mount
Ravens up high
far up in the sky
The northern dark
where winterkings rule
Far from the light
gates to Blashyrkh Rise
Far beneath the blackened sun
mountains they rise
Far beneath the blackened sun
thunder the ice
Far on thy reign
gods as we ride
Throne of the sons of the northern darkness
Far above the ravengate
The spreaded wings of Blashyrkh wait
Into the real beyond the sun
Blackened mountains on my ride
Cold is the realm
dark is the realm
Grim is my call
Nocturnal kingdom on the rise
Blackest wraiths on they stride
Lurk beneath the frosted sky
In my eyes the whirling snow
And the dead and frozen ground
Unwhite
Blackened Earth
Winterized
The Blashyrkh Sons
Phantom frosted 
glowing ice
Death beneath the burning light
Mighty realm of wind and snow
Where I reign the tyrants throne
Snowy mountains hear my call
In this realm I am the one
Enemy of all
grim is my call
Blackened demonic God
In my eternal kingdom cold
From far above descend the beast
Blackened here
where winter reign
Embrace the dark that gapes beyond
The face of winter
frozen ground
The realm between the tides
where dawn begin to strike the sky
Mist - twilight moons
I want the tyrants to return
The doom of all to come
a time where chaos rule the one
Day of awakening
where we throne and reign the end
Thunderous march 
fanfares of old
Fimbulwinter
we are called to ice
Sons of the north
darkened tales
Fimbulwinter
we are called to ice
Descendt upon our tome 
the countdown to damnation
All dead and doomed
where the end knows day nor dawn
Cometh the untamed ones
so shall we thrive to rule em all
The sum of wrath
soon to reveal it's evil sons
The wrath of the beast descend
Gathering storms in the sky
Daylight darkened
thunder of the ice
The wrath of the beast descend and call us to ice
Across the snows
the throne of all thrones
We are by darkness found
to reveal a time to come
The northern souls
built to survive the eternal cold
Where the frost never cease
where the wind sing eternally
The heart of winter
that precede the end of the world
Thunderous march
fanfares of old
Fimbulwinter
we are called to ice
Sons of the north
darkened tales
Fimbulwinter
we are called to ice
For the mighty mountains I ride
Through the woods beyond the snow
Like a fire among the stars
beyond the clouds she rise
There's no fire from the sun
in this dark under the moon
My blackened sight behold the stars
and fallen suns below
Darkness rage within my mind
a rage until the final call
Still no fire from the sun there is none but the other side
Awakes my soul to feel the rise
as I walk on my own
Mountains of ice
rise for the one
Might that occur toward the sky
Mountains of ice
shunned by moonlight
Now into the bare ice...
For the mighty mountain I ride
Through the woods beyond the snow
Like a fire among the stars
beyond the clouds she rise
Bring no fire from the sun there is none but the other side
Blacken sight upon the stars
and fallen suns below
Mountains of ice
rise for the one
Might that occur toward the sky
Mountains of ice
shunned by moonlight
Now into the bare ice...
Return to the call of the wintermoon
Welcome to ice
where mountains rise
The dark worlds of shadows formed ages unknown
Fires to rise from below
Into the dark voids of the blackened beyond
Come my vision of old
The battle in my mind "storms from within
Tyrants of vengeance and war
Unforgotten is the old vengeful ones
When cold winds and ice bite like swords
Worlds
blacker of worlds
Visions to rise
as granted by the gods
from tales beyond the horizon
They battled the God of the Sun
Taken to where thunder rolls
In time when battles begun
In the shadow of the rising beasts from beyond
I journey
my own dark vision
Fierce frozen vast
paling moon shine
To the bleak hill of the north
Where rising swords once stroke into fire
I'll gather the embattled ones
Darkly beyond all horizons
gathering roars of war
Soon call to arms
swords to meet thy doom
Awakened by shadows
summon the eldest of gods
Clangor of swords
from whom I had called
Frozen up north
Far from the sun
Where the heart of winter is one
Cold winds they blow
All frost and snow
Shadows creep in forests old
Unending realm awaiting fires end
All light from worlds disappear
I lurk the paths where grimly woods near
Frozen gates call me from there
Under these mountainsides rises no sun
Whereas the icy cold mountains are one
Beyond the wintery woods winds they call
Here under the might of its greatness I roar
Forests climb to mountains
Cold winds they blow
Thunder and twilight and snow
Frost, wind and fog, snow deep and cold
In the realm that is hidden from all
Mindless voices speak through the heart of the gods
From the wintery woods winds they call
Caught in the shadows of thy ravenrealm
The kingdom that blackened my soul
Under these mountainsides rises no sun
Whereas the icy cold mountains are one
Beyond the wintery woods winds they call
Here under the might of its greatness I roar
Throne of the north
Mountains of might
Blashyrkh by name
Blashyrkh by fire
Towers of ice
Shadows of gods
Tales of the one
Frozen kingdom
Kingdom of north
Throne of them all
Tales of the one
Mountaineous sons
The throne of north
Mighty be thy law
Frozen up north
Far from the sun
Where the heart of winter is one
Cold winds they blow
All frost and snow
Shadows creep in forests old
Unending realm awaiting fires end
All light from worlds disappear
I lurk the paths where grimly woods near
Frozen gates call me from there
Under these mountainsides rises no sun
Whereas the icy cold mountains are one
Beyond the wintery woods winds they call
Here under the might of its greatness I roar
Years of plead, behind the walls
Chambers and vaults, Scenes of fright
Unspoken Words, in pain and dread
140 lives passed his hands
the perverted son
The holy man... hanged by nobility
Into The Crypts of Rays...
Alluring children for his masses
Robbing and buying young souls
Sacrifice to morbid demons
Satisfy his repulsive sexual lust
the perverted son
The holy man... hanged by nobility
Into The Crypts of Rays...
So this is for the morbid one,
The braveless and sick
Shivering laughter shrilled through the tombs
Sexual offence and perverted rites
Watching them limp and die...
Wizards and darkness
Halfway came true...
As a late medieval's French marshall
Unrestrained, with endless ambitions
the perverted son
The holy man... hanged by nobility
Into The Crypts of Rays...
Overdone Mystism and
Desperate Satanism
Are just one small step apart
There's no human scheme in the beyond...
the perverted son
The holy man... hanged by nobility
Into The Crypts of Rays...
My life turns into sand
Immortality is my dream
Man shall follow my command
Sorcery shall conquer my fear
Astral magic and runic wand
I feel that wisdom's near
Across the mountain's ice
Scarlett at the equinox' dawn
I sacrificed an innocent lamb
And drunk the wine of paradise
But, still run the sands of time
Just one thing yet to be done
As spell surround me
At a lightmass' night
He raised the abyss
Covered by the sword
I sold my soul in vein
I feel it, as he returns
The sands of time will never run
For an immortal dead man
See the portal, gate to madness
Locked forever in a veil of shame
Deny extraction
Thirst for disgrace
Watch his break
The emperor's killed
Light of the day
Shadows from beyond
Scaffold of steel
The throne has gone
Dethroned emperor
The foot of the stairs, dimension in might
The king sits, his eyes are glass
Growing of the small
The laughter's fall
Can you deny
Remaining cries?
Descent of the lords
Into the trap
Existence and hate
Unseen gate
Dethroned emperor
By burial this night
Nitocrys weaves the spell
Down the vault's misty light
The lurking Sphinx dwells
Agony and nightmare
To Yog sothoth they noan
Nightfalls, morbid affair
Beard the faceless one
In the nuclear domain
Arcades lost in eternal skries
Written by the insane
Agony and nightmare
To Yog sothoth they noan
Nightfalls, morbid affair
Beard the faceless one
Mummy's rebirth by wrath
Below the temple of nile
Vanished in Osiris' path
Above us reigns the Necrophile
Agony and nightmare
Nightfalls, morbid affair
Beard the faceless one
Morbid Tales
After the battle is over
And the sands drunken the blood
All what there remains
Is the bitterness of delusion
The immortality of the gods
Sits at their side
As they leave the walls behind
To reach the jewels gleam
The days have come
When the steel will rule
And upon his head
A crown of gold
Your hand wields the might
The tyrant's the precursor
You carry the will
As the morning is near
I sing the ballads
Of victory and defeat
I hear the tales
Of frozen mystery
The new kingdoms rise
By the circle of the tyrants
In the land of darkness
The warrior, that was me
Grotesque glory
None will ever see them fall
And hunts and war
Are like everlasting shadows
Where the winds cannot reach
The tyrant's might was born
And often I look back
With tears in my eyes
Grotesque glory
None will ever see them fall
And hunts and wars
Are like everlasting shadows
You are blind
Deny the sun and light
Whose are the objections
From where come the doubts
Evidence of infinity
Procreation of the wicked
Twist of the known
Procreation of the wicked
Serenades of opposition
Absurdity, humans fate and hope
True reflections of community
Procreation of the gods and lords
Evidence of infinity
Procreation of the wicked
Twist of the known
Procreation of the wicked
Cain and Abel's love and death
Love and hate is what we are
Dagger and grail are
Fallen of the altar
Evidence of infinity
Procreation of the wicked
Twist of the known
Procreation of the wicked
Mysteries of perversity
I've killed this old man, because he limped
I've done it because he shouldn't have to do it
If god raised the abyss
you'd procreate your own
Abolism of death is
Abolism of life
Evidence of infinity
Procreation of the wicked
Twist of the known
Procreation of the wicked
Dreaming eyes
Hope to return
As shadows fall onto
Distorted paths
Delivered from the fetters of light
Drifting back into my reality
The subconscious deprecates the day
In the twilight of my own intellect
Dull is my mind
Captive of illusion
Remaining awake
Is just dust
Take my soul away into the dark
Dreaming a thousand morbid dreams
No tomorrow when the wind caress my mind
Could I ever return, it would be my doom
Obsessed by the nightmare's sound
Drifting back into realms of chaos
Reality has become my dream
I'll be covered by the abyss' ground
An endless fall
Memories in the light
Frontiers of chaos
Return to the eve
Obscurity hides the plateau
Stars darkened at their place
Nanna's glowing above
Illuminates the silent scenery
Aeon of night
Eager to prevail
From the mountains of dawn they cry
The call of the frantic god
From the womb of mother earth they scream
The wage of creation and sin
The sleeping lord awakes
Tiamat pulls on her chains
The blind phantom rages
Vibrations at the black ethers edge
As nocturnal fear penetrates the land
Ecstatical celebrations at their zenith
The seven sharpen their claws
Winds emerge from the east
Deep dark water moves
Even the cold moon eclipses
When they adore the dog-faced-beast
As they admit the infernal tide
The eye on the throne derides
The old gods and their tribes
In chaos Tiamat laughs pride.
Listen
As the mist is rising
And uncovers all that's lost
Try and mend what you can barely feel
Even if it is forgotten and done
Watch out who is still on the throne
While the sighs of life are borne
The bloodless race of old
As startled
The flow of denial without remembering
The flood is still in motion
The ground on fire all along
Leave the thought of crying
Deny and harm the endless day
Where will be vulgarity
In these immune sights
Along the way I'm leaving this wreck
Without the suicidal horde
The day will come
And I'll be able to see
The flag rising of the free
Until eternity
Thousand decades in vain
Again they strive for final completion
Forgotten are the fast sins
And the perfect creation calls
What will the wind bring these days?
The smell of self-deception?
Masses of dullness, a spiral cage
As they ride on visual aggression
Once, I slept in confidence
Sounds like I've been a fool
Now, as my will is invisible
They shall face the evoked curse alone...
What will the wind bring these days?
The smell of self-deception?
Masses of dullness, a spiral cage
As they ride on visual aggression
Just fool yourself
a world of ignorance
Will tear the walls of dreams apart
Vast signals
memories in black
Sense is beyond distorted
Flood of tears you'll have to drink
As the grail is lying on the floor
Don't ask for another messiah
No martyr will save the stupid again
Is truth what you believe?
A prophet's tears will dry...
What will the wind bring these days?
The smell of self-deception?
Masses of dullness, a spiral cage
As they ride on visual aggression
The watcher's eyes are closed
As the dust covers the madmen again
There'll be a new king
And I was born to encounter him...
What will the wind bring these days?
The smell of self-deception?
Masses of dullness, a spiral cage
As they ride on visual aggression
Once prayed to my gods, searching for the whistled memories
Empty eyes are staring now, to my feet a land of sorrow
I'm the king, sitting in the dark hiding from the shadows of the wind
Wafts of might, wine of fire, I was called to taste
Silver horses brought us here, to the edge of the universe
We left the falling walls as the stars' collapse began
Now I rest on the highest steps, revealed the eternal frontier
As I gaze from the Jewel Throne to the portal of infinity
Fallen have the "chosen ones", debris remain in the dust
Far behind, beyond the sands, the wind sings to those who fell
Forever now, my hands laid down the weapons
I will pray to my gods, searching for the memories
Lend me your steel-bearing hand
So I may reign the Jewel Throne
My soul feels the gods' demand
As the lost kings uphold my side
Blood and sand
Mark their way
The usurper's tears
Guide my sword...
Fantasia slept in my thoughts
As I was a son of infinity
The emperor, forgotten, rests in my dreams
As, back to the wall, I start my conquest
Blood and sand
Mark their way
The usurper's tears
Guide my sword...
Innocence and wrath
Now lie far beyond
As we cross the deserts
To reach the fortress' gates
Tragic serenades
Are whispered in the wind
As eyes in fury
Grant us our strength
They're throning on the dignity of might
But the successor is to enter the hall
False truth saw them climbing the steps
But I remain the Jewel Throne's choice
Blood and sand
Mark their way
The usurper's tears
Guide my sword...
Humilated in human form
We have to die to be reborn
Awaiting the final judgement
The dawn now lifts
Subjects of flesh
Slaves of lust
The cross has failed
You won't see the coming fall
A diviner's fire and soil
Flames, like flowers, like blood
Fires of freedom, flowers of doom
A surface of hateful hope
Oh subjects of pain
Lovers of death
You will feel
The yearning flames
Flames like tongues 
like cries
Pant for kisses
For bites
Seven steps
And we're one
Humilated
In human thoughts
The frost, it bites
Your inner heart
Frozens the flame
ln every eye
The lord will come
Broken ice
The fire will burn
Gleaming ways
Well never be reborn
Prenatal death's redeemed our lives
Into his hand we demand our hearts
The lord and we are one
The pyramids tremble, darken the sun, the sky tums red
They reached the wall of no return and the breeze has stopped
Who wore the crown will never be known
might is broken
For all we'll drown into the sand
what will remain?
Inverted horizons, denied truth and blinded eyes
The Titans arise, the monuments fall, we cannot halt
Wishful pleads at last came true, some always knew
The clouds burn
or is it fire?
the gods wince
Human pride and megalomania
The Titans watched it all
The trace led to nowhere
Wrath had to come
As ushers at the gates
To ecstasy and excess
All turn their backs
They won't give us any rest
The fires won't redeem, illuminated's the night
the eternal summer
When they came high from the sphere on shrieking wings...
Now they're trapped to the ground, to heat and dust
And the eye is glowing above...
After the battle is over
And the sands drunken the blood
All what there remains
Is the bitterness of delusion
The immortality of the gods
Sits at their side
As they leave the walls behind
To reach the jewels gleam
The days have come
When the steel will rule
And upon his head
A crown of gold
Your hand wields the might
The tyrant's the precursor
You carry the will
As the morning is near
I sing the ballads
Of victory and defeat
I hear the tales
Of frozen mystery
The new kingdoms rise
By the circle of the tyrants
In the land of darkness
The warrior, that was me
Grotesque glory
None will ever see them fall
And hunts and war
Are like everlasting shadows
Where the winds cannot reach
The tyrant's might was born
And often I look back
With tears in my eyes
Grotesque glory
None will ever see them fall
And hunts and wars
Are like everlasting shadows
On days of northern wind, past illusions surround my dreams
Drops of mute oceans breath in the palm of my hand
The sound of silent waves still caresses all my thoughts
Where warm, mystic floods dominated the upper hemisphere
And dark ships sailed beyond those lost realms
Through gates to eternity, above the sleeping mind
Forever inconquerable seemed the walls of time
To those who always feared and always fled the dawn
But then, the guardians growl invited the thirst for steeI
Part god, part man, if I walked by their side
The old man's dream now has ended much too soon
Forgotten rests the wisdom that brought them once so far
Vanished until rebirth, we sleep the endless sleep
For one who knows never tries to reappear
Try to see through fainted views
As reality disappears in haze
A journey between eternal walls
The senses unfold before my eyes
As the endless dreams begin to reign
And my hands slip off the edge
The waters grow dumb
While they descend behind
Fainted eyes
Drifting in the streams of wisdom
While recognizing all those banal tales
Sin beyond truth, I see glimmering splinters
Encountering my past in flickering whispers
While they drown behind their frontiers
And the rulers sink in agony
Fallacy and false idols
Unbelievable is the human direction
But the screams die away in the distance
Try to see through fainted views
But the dust still covers all my dreams
I wouldn't tell you anyway ...
Necromantical screams.
Only you are deaf.
Is there life beyond death?
You've entreated death. 
The answer will come.
Debris of faith. 
Even you are false.
Immortal morals. 
Caught up in time.
Vault of darkness. 
Filled with hate.
Deny life. 
Addiction to death.
Procession of damnation. 
Expulsion of light.
Hazardous ways. 
Into the rush.
Soul is frozen and flesh is weak.
Necromantical screams.
Only you are deaf.
Intelligence is mute.
Respect and thoughts. 
Buried long ago.
Pleading for the end. 
Blind and dumb.
We won't feel. 
There could be more.
I will remain alone in the dark
...only you are deaf
You, who like the moon at night
Haunted my mortal heart ...
You who made this ancient walls
Shine like divine marble
The unwanted breath through creedence
A derelict shell in the desert
Mesmerised
As love inflamed the night
Burning tongues brought the rain
The sand remained purified
Murmur at the meager's spear
Battered Carthagian pride
The beloved cry wasted dismay
Invasion of baseness and shade
You, loved by your father
Innocent as a vestal dove
Buried in a deep blue sea
As we all lose
Sleep brings no joy to me
Remembrance never dies
My soul is given to misery
And lives in sighs
The shadows of the dead,
My waken eyes may never see,
Surround my bed
That from which they sprung
eternity
Beneath the turf
The silent dead
Sleep brings no wish to knit
My harrassed heart beneath
My only wish is to forget
In the sleep of death
Death is my joy
I long to be at rest
I wish the damp earth covered
This desolate brest
Beneath the mould
The silent dead
But the glad eyes around us
Must weep as we have done
And we must see the same gloom
Eclipse their morning sun
Oh not for them
Should we despair
The grave is drear
But they're not there
Their dust is mingled
With the sod
Their pale souls
Are gone, to god
Well, may they live in ecstasy
Their long eternity of joy
At least I wouldn't bring them down
With me to weep, to groan
And what's the future
A sea beneath the cloudless sun
A mighty, glorious, dazzling sea
Stretching into infinity
My inner sanctum
Lights have faded
Euphoria is dead
Past and present
Exalt of the weird
Chimerias petrified
Eclipse and suspicion
Deafened stream
Babylon fell
Distraction and envy, Babylon fell
Festal perishing, Babylon fell
Dreams drift in the frozen wind
And mysteries are reborn
We rose from sand and stone
To follow the light's allure
Tears drift in the shadows sleep
Turn innocence into excess
Fragments of a dying world
And destiny lies beneath
Sceptres of bombast
Tracks into myth
Fetish and feud
Dance of recesses
Fierce laughter
Banned into stone
Eyes of guilt
Covered by sand
is it addiction to prevail
or mute marble words
my heart
coarse and fallen
into the sand
oblivion into grief
millenniums perish
pillars of desire
therefore I have seen
meurt et seduction
des comptes morbides
tasting rhetoric hate
an attraction verified
fall of luster
and fake caresses
mundane beggars
costume of death
a purified doctrine
and communal repentance
my mortalized quest
the enigma still unborn
oceans of grime and stone
shores of wasted might
soaring remains forfeit
my visionary dream
wings of lust
temptation and fame
temples of prowess
left a man among ruins
caress into oblivion
I did taste their only dream
As denial was still unborn
Secrets beyond those dethroned walls
And echoes of a martyr's scream
Deterrent vibrates the allurements face
As my barque drowns toward conquest
Don't quieten the elder's tears
For they've forseen our past
Covered lies our remembrance
As symbols turn to dust
I won't dance
I won't dance
I won't dance within despair
I won't dance
The elder's orient
Journey lnto a wicked world
My body beneath the skies
Erotic wishes, my heart has failed
Incalculable is the surface's breath
Paralyzed form
the ring of death
Steps on the stairs to my silent ecstasy
Caress of the mental space
Thrones of fake life
Eternal addiction towards those eyes
Gods didn't you believe my earthbound call?
Slipping into the hidden sun
Intoxicated by an endless fall
This evening the moon dreams more lazily
As some fair woman, lost in cushions deep
With gentle hand caresses listlessly
The contour of her breasts before she sleeps
On velvet backs of avalanches soft
She often lies enraptured as she dies
And gazes on white visions aloft
Which like a blossoming to heaven rise
When sometimes on this globe, in indolence
She lets a secret tear drop down, by chance
A poet, set against oblivion
Takes in his hand this pale and furtive tear
This opal drop where rainbow hues appear
And hides it in his breast far from the sun
You have joined your father's feast
Those who saw Essence or fall
Floods of dramatic silence
And words, from whom we don't know
Let me dream...
Flee from false...
I have tasted the weight of lust
My hands on the skein of height
A pallid death
Mirage into dark
The horizons echo your glance
Following a detractive sleep
I am the wrath beneath the heavens
The downfall's monologue
Fallen into the vision of effect
Quiet as gods can be
Joining the king's words
Orgies of fear
lnbreeding and death
I have walked Carthagia's sands
l've touched those buried walls
All mortal is love?
Remembrance has won
Breathing glorified innonce
Quiescence has died therefore
We stood before the portals of Babylon
And saw it's petrified fall
...Have seen your decline's symbols
But carried another life
We tasted the wine of Persepolis,
As mute as our era's breath
Death was never a fragment of
Exalting fantasy...
This last region
Last of fire
Orgasmic cries
Tears and words
Wrath and strenght
Oh, gods! For you!
Before the throne...
Death
Fright and praise
A faded light
Intimate rests my book
Unwritten what seems true
Art of might!
You remaining king
Take your predesessor's hand
You son of my Jade gift...
Dancing violet dreams.
Joining nights of satin fame.
Acting jewel games.
All forgiven, you streak my heart.
More than pleasure in ice cold flames.
Crying soft, as love flies tame.
Swelling tears in diaries of lies.
Fading lights, as songs die quiet.
Bleeding sweet for dying blind.
Masking fears of silent decline.
Cherry Orchards. 
Ginger looks upon pain.
Cherry Orchards. 
August fades like tears in vain.
Winter's final shine. 
Dressing gold, one last time.
Seep from lace. 
Roses for an unborn face.
Cherry Orchards. 
Ginger looks upon pain.
Cherry Orchards. 
August fades like tears in vain.
Thirst and desire, to rule the light
For crossing heavens, a futile fight
Bound to storm, our minds wave
Fervent to sail in deserts of mist
Juices like wine, like the blood in the sands
Juices like wine
Born of earth, we strive for skies
Obsessed with lies, in arms of sleep
Earning dreams, we blind our eyes
Challenging secrets, ancient the cries
Juices like wine, like the blood in the sands
Juices like wine
Four arc lights. 
Moving stealth.
Two ride up north. 
Into the barrel fear.
Desire to share. 
My valiant care.
Downtown Hanoi.
We are drowning in purple wine.
Standing as one, as one we line.
Gold and light did stop their dance.
A fever obscene, a wicked romance.
I'm tasting sweat on my tongue.
Fane of wicked green.
Faith to the heart.
Passion and death.
Downtown's breath.
Heaven carries not
What the soul would reap
Growth of deception
Lined between the weeps
A thousand lusts luring in the heart
A desire in our sleep Nemesis
A million lies striving to be shared
An afterthought formed
First among fallen idols
Of the pandemonial storm
The heart beneath, the desire to die
Scepters of Scarlet, the eternal lie
Tormented eyes, perceiving relief
The shadow's light won't disappear
The mist reveals the shades of grief
The heart beneath, inside my fear
They're sleeping through the ages
Faces bare of names
Remembrance ever lies
At the Bosom of the insane
Death's cold embrace
Across the restless seas
Unfolding the wish to forget
The eyes of the deceased
Thirst for the wine in my hand
Third from the sun
The heart of death
A thought for fake desires
Starving trough the night
Engulfed in an earthbound fire
Left all alone among the dances and cries
They seed all the hate
Within the shade of sights
I'm sensing the paleness of lies
No rest to caress their eyes
In visions enthroning sleep
A mistress of eternal weep
Wastelands against the night
Bound in chains, a wish for light
Wandering beneath my fate my body slowly pales
Unleashed, with hands that cannot reach
The screams of heaven and shores
sound of a shadowed search
Foresee the wings of solitude
The wings of solitude
Ages of bleeding in vain
Entrapped by the whine of the insane
Civilization
a vision of deceit
Misfits, emerged from the heat
The violet dances fade
Restless dreams of hate and a silent cry
Wastelands against the night
Bound in chains a wish for light
Wandering beneath my fate
My body slowly pales
Burning in a hell made of my own
Looking for the you I once knew
Your love is hanging over me
Like a big black cloud of misery
Oh mother I beg of you to set me free
Now, like the tempting snake of old
She has seduced my very soul
She took my rib she stole my heart
And hid it in her bosom's warmth
Oh mother hallowed be thy name
For u give birth to us in pain
Maybe I'm Adam with a paradise lost
Or maybe I'm Abel, maybe I'm not
But as sure as hell I know that I'll be chain
Wasting love and my life again
Oh woman of sorrow, you guide me on
into caverns, where I do not belong
Out of your womb, onto the earth
Oh mother of my life, please give me birth
Oh mother of pain, please let me go
For you must reap what you have sown
Oh mother, my mother yes I know
The name of my bride is sorrow
Traces of dew, eyes in disbelief
Did we persist in misery and grief
Tasting a glance of the bold
A thousand days of fates untold
And from the restless seas I'm born
Through pain and in the restless seas I drown
Love in vain
Cold embrace
Regresses from mankind's trace
Ruling the light, we gave our lonely hearts
Addicted fiends, through weakened weeps and woes
The sight of fear, trading in for faith
Eternal thirst to lead the circling hate
Traces of dew, eyes in disbelief
Shattered at base, the lies that we breathe
No more... 
Harassed Hearts Primeval wings of solitude
The cross has saved the soil
Traces given to sinister moods
Cavity of hate
Unborn faith, scorn beneath
The quest for death
Gold built the mortal feat
Into the phallic tantrum
Stronghold of eternal fear
Into the phallic tantrum
Their only wish to reappear
Infinite space
No dreams of sleep of death
Humane, cold embrace
Concepts of might and reign
The apocalyptic raids
Shadows over the hearts beneath
Calls that forever fade
Their visions betrayed
By masquerade of sleep madness ever lures
Resting soul's rebirth, denying the depths of fear
Necropolis Built from mortal bones
Death descends inside the darkened mind
A thousand cries in pain, spread beneath the fall
A kiss glowing above, feeding upon the heart
Spells... on glory they ride from within
Light, as they seed hate onto the path
A kiss or a whisper
Floods of hate without relief for all sinister sleep
Shadows of eternal belief
Deep within my bleeding heart
Stranded by the hold of fear
Agony takes a final role
Sipping the dew of tears
Thorns and rites idols of false
Tearing apart the skin of lust
Forever still but never born
Broken by the final quest
Vanity, silent choir spreading lies
Vanity, fallen shrine of muted sighs
Surrender, dance and cry
Their Tormented eyes perceive
Grasps of fright, lusters crawl
Tarnished grounds of faded beliefs
Heaven and shores
Beneath the death of the sun
Suffering at will
Slaves in the cavity of doom
Wastelands without winds
Cries cut through the lies
The heat of the deserts
Heart closes to my throat
Will death cleanse me of this nemesis
I taste the blood and all the pain
In darkened depths
A vision of fear becomes as real
Nursing the dead
No love, life is grief
Dare to escape
The claws of sleep of death
No good, no cold
Salvation we are praying for
Days full of fear The silent eyes perceive
Will death cleanse me of this nemesis
I taste the blood and all the pain
What kind of race, lack of direction
Just how lunatic, to have a nature so deceit
Bewail my reverie, a gambol untried
Lure of carnality and silence in forfeit
Animals, enslaved to pearls of fictionalized worth
Creatures, born from caves into simulated mirth
I'm talking, Idols of Chagrin
Born of posession, complacement in disguise
Craving and candid, as to defy the character's fall
The kisses you drain, pedestrian pedigree
What's thought is pain might be desire after all
Babylon asleep, an everlasting foe
Striving to hurt, for flesh becomes dirt
Resting within, the sacred fire
I can't withold, the lies untold
Dances and cries, a descent to babylon
Wine in my hand, a descent to babylon
All eyes must foul, in stench of fear
Killing to quench, Babylon's tears
We are wisphering for holy wine
Innocence to reign, a world of shrines
This crazy dream, raging over ages
For only one belief. 
Killing
Suffer for a thought
In human blood, stretched out
A descent to a 1000 deaths
As sweet as snow, as cold as dew
A descent to a 1000 deaths.
Babylon asleep
Dreaming eyes, hope to return
As shadows fall, onto distorted paths
Delivered from the fetters of light
Drifting back to my reality
Subconscious depreates the day
In the twilight of my own intellect
Dull is my mind, Captive of illusion
Remain awake, Is just dust!
Take my soul away into the dark, 
dreaming 1000 morbid dreams, no tomorrow
when the wind caresses my mind, could I ever return
it would be my Doom
Obsessed by the nightmare's sound
Drifting back into the realms of chaos
Reality has become my dream
I'll be covered by the abyss ground
Endless fall, Memories in the light
frontiers of chaos, Return to the EVE
I stalk alone the burried seas
Dead and white, weak memories
Below 0, I'm turning blue
Why does the ice burn so hot
Frozen waters, a strange land
I know I live, as the frost bites
My eyes are closed, but I can't sleep
Moving forward, for sleep means death
A white shroud covers me
I buried myself to stay alive
Time's passing slow on my pale face
Beneath the snow, beneath the ice
I stalk alone the burried seas
Dead and white, weak memories
Dancing violet dreams.
Joining nights of satin fame.
Acting jewel games.
All forgiven, you streak my heart.
More than pleasure in ice cold flames.
Crying soft, as love flies tame.
Swelling tears in diaries of lies.
Fading lights, as songs die quiet.
Bleeding sweet for dying blind.
Masking fears of silent decline.
Cherry Orchards. 
Ginger looks upon pain.
Cherry Orchards. 
August fades like tears in vain.
Winter's final shine. 
Dressing gold, one last time.
Seep from lace. 
Roses for an unborn face.
Cherry Orchards. 
Ginger looks upon pain.
Cherry Orchards. 
August fades like tears in vain.
Lend me your steel-bearing hand
So I may reign the Jewel Throne
My soul feels the gods' demand
As the lost kings uphold my side
Blood and sand
Mark their way
The usurper's tears
Guide my sword...
Fantasia slept in my thoughts
As I was a son of infinity
The emperor, forgotten, rests in my dreams
As, back to the wall, I start the conquest
Innocence and wrath
Now lie far beyond
As we cross the deserts
To reach the fortress' gates
Tragical serenades
Are whispered in the wind
As eyes in fury
Grant us our strength
They're throning on the dignity of might
But the successor is to enter the hall
False truth saw them climbing the steps
But I remain the Jewel Throne's choice
The face of Nemesis
Under pandemonium's heat
Parched my yearning whisper
In this world of deceit
To lie, to cry, they die
To drown in their well of sighs
All their pain bears their name
Ignorance dies by its own lies
Tears of indignation
Crying under Apollyon's sun
In faith for love
Underground, a dream apart
Flesh from soil
Disparate, no less the same
Sift my tears
The lasting spring
We were raised to fade
To deluge by carnal claims
To lie, to cry, they die
To drown in their well of sighs
I am you.
Stillborn.
Into this state of being numb.
I am the temple and the sacrifice.
The shrine, entombed within lies all I am.
And you, the womb from whence I came.
I am you.
If I am you, no life is sacred in my hands.
If I am you, no love will prosper in this world.
If I am you, I am the faith to end all faith.
If I am you, you shall not live to save yourselves.
I bring no God, no after world.
I am no more than a lie.
I love your life not for you.
I am a throne made from dust.
I am hatred, seeping blood.
The rain, the flood, the grief.
I am rage becoming flesh.
A dismal, ravaged life.
This is pain, a wall of tears.
And my tears are my truest friends.
This, my heart, a dying sun.
A flower fading to black.
Oh God, why have you forsaken me?
In this darkness, called my mind.
The waste you left for me.
I'm your shit, your verbal smut.
Your twisted world recapped.
This is you, your lifeless soul.
Your sick and fucked-up lies.
In my world your love is death.
Your disease, your skin that burns.
Oh God, why have you forsaken me?
You tied my limbs and buried me alive.
And piled this frozen mud.
You watched me die with lustrous eyes.
As all your words grew stale.
You mocked my care and stained my mind.
You yearned for me to fail.
All is cold and frozen.
Frozen the sea, frozen the sky.
Frozen is death, but I cannot die.
Cannot die.
As the snow falls.
To cover this all.
And all is cold.
And cold is all.
All is cold and cold is all.
Cold.
Frozen.
Frozen is heaven and frozen is hell.
And I am dying in this living human shell.
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh.
I am a dying God.
Frozen my heart.
Frozen my soul.
Frozen my love.
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh.
I drown in ashes you've enshrined.
Of blissful days long gone by.
Concealed behind my dying eyes.
This hell of anger and weary lies.
A frame of mind, a dismal soul.
My final womb, this flesh turned cold.
You held me down and let me bleed.
My love, it died, along with me.
A world of scars and caresses pale.
And thoughts as chaste as pristine dew.
And flowers placed across your face.
I trace the life I've lost with you.
This bleakest pit that you've unveiled.
I hate to love as it is pain.
My hands are cut but I still sail.
An ocean of sadness in the rain.
My flesh, my blood.
My wound, my cry.
My broken back, my all now dies.
My soul, my tomb.
My pain, my joy.
My darkest mind, my love destroyed.
A pallid sun sheds dimmest glow.
On mute and pallid soil.
I am the one, a life long gone.
A refuge raped in search of life.
Like a shadow on this earth.
In embraces pale as human flesh.
I am unborn, and I'm undone.
How much of me is lost.
I deny my own desire.
Lying one among the liars.
I deny my own desire.
Dark in darkness I can see.
Nothingness is blinding me.
I'm drowning in this sea.
For those I loved I hurt.
So you taketh from me.
My name untold and numb.
Where I am there is no thing.
No God, no me, no inbetween.
Somewhere inside.
It's still obscured.
Darkness reflects.
Stronger than fear.
I seize control to inhale this final day.
I shut my mind but I'm falling anyway.
No.
And I think that I'm all alone.
I can feel the rain pull me down again.
No.
And I know that I have no home.
I can feel the pain take a hold again.
Tied to the ground.
In mounting shade.
My soul is bound.
And so it fades.
And I know that I won't escape.
My remaining faith is draped.
Like my hurt and my fleeting grace.
In this numbing empty space.
Within these darkest walls.
As I write these lines.
In this domain of decay.
Words fall on the soil beneath.
Enfold, embrace, besiege, swathe.
My domain.
Within these darkest walls.
How can I be human?
They say they are blind.
Smearing ashes across glass.
In this forest of harbored thoughts.
There's demons in my mind.
And I entrust myself to the lure.
Of leaving this existence behind.
Lay thy hand on the neck of your enemies.
Devour their flesh with thy sword.
Bring down the slain from among thine adversaries.
They shall fall to rise no more.
Thy wrath inflame my passion.
Against all sinful flesh.
Let thy wrath consume all of thine enemies.
Scourge them with flames of fire.
Lay thy feet on the pile of those slain by thy mysteries.
We shall be cleansed by their blood.
Thus said the Lord
Feel my holy wrath.
I am glorified.
I cannot be denied.
I am he who is.
Punishment for wickedness.
I am the one you dread.
You are as good as dead.
There is no God but the one that dies with me.
I have no life but the one I take with me to the grave.
We come into this world alone.
And we will die on our own.
I live.
I die.
I have never heard his voice nor have I ever seen his form.
Yet still he casts his dark shadow on the light of my being
Death 
Negation of being
Wraith of inner sanctum
Apparition of my amorphousness
Solemnity of my disembodiment
Death 
Decay
Creator of corpses
Principle of annihilation
Secret of negativity
Unspeakable silence
Despairing monologue
Internalized conflict externalized as war.
Hymning thy rebellion Lucifer morning star.
Bringer of light, forever shrouded by night.
I am hell, a sulphurous lake of fire and suffering.
My blackened heart is a writhing mass of poisonous snakes.
Grotesquely slithering as I slowly shed my dying skin.
In darkness.
Thou shall come unto me.
In darkness.
Thou shall worship me.
In darkness.
Thou art mine eternally.
Thy curse.
All of my lies.
Be blessed.
Lord of the flies.
Scapegoat.
Shunned and despised.
My church is my sacrifice.
Follow after me into the halls of my damnation.
I wield death like a scythe, reaping my annihilation.
A monarch enthroned upon my throne of guilt.
I am hell, a barren shrine to decay and neglect.
Uninhabitable, the darkened depths of cold empty space.
My necropolis, the catacombs and tombs of disease.
Monumental, the fallen temple of dead deities.
My necrolog, an eternal curse lost in the abyss.
Bow down before thy lord below.
I shall rise.
I shall rule in blasphemy.
And in the end when thou art mine thou will be like me.
damned to a ghostly substance
created by a lesser god
damned to carry this burden
forever in your sour souls
damned to dig on rotten roots
you are doomed and none shall live
the essence that keeps you alive
nothing but venom injected by wrath
on cold landscapes of ghostly substance
the dragon spreads its wings
the only dragon, creator of time
on paths where
once surrounded by night
throned the dragon of time now dwells
the swords dipped in blood
stone cold, washed away by time
none shall live and all shall die
immortal we stand
on the hills where the dragon flies
on the hills where dragon flies
Right in the dark
Flames burn the glade
You'll die, before we can try
The blood aprise, shall not worry
Your turn to pray
You must not die
In this place we're all, we'll be alone
But we pray and lord will grant us life
That's all I'll be
Break my spell
Right, but late
Called at the gates of
Place of bewitched
Don't worry now
The blood - a price
The shadows bouncing over me.
My star, I saw it high and far
At the parting of the ways
A light on the edge of the outer night
Like silver set ablaze
Where the round world plunges steeply down
But on the old roads goes
As an unseen bridge that on arches runs
To coasts that no man knows
I would not find the burning domes and sands
Where reigns the sun, nor dare the snows
Nor seek in mountains dark the landscapes of the men
long lost to where no pathway goes
But where they bloom those flowers fair
In what air or land they grow
What words beyond the world I heard
If you would seek for know
In a boat then, brother, far afloat
You must labour in the sea
And find yourself things out of mind:
You will learn no more of me
I would not find the burning domes and sands
Where reigns the sun, nor dare the deadly snows
Nor seek in mountains dark the landscapes of the men
Of long lost to where no pathway goes
There the twain enfolded,
Phantom twilight, phantom twilight,
And dim the mazes dark, unholy,
I would never find the burning domes and sands
Where reigns the sun, nor dare the snows
Nor seek in mountains dark, the landscapes of the men
Long lost to whom no pathway goes
Yet, if the wind breathe soft, the curling waves
That break against the shore, shall lull my mind
And scorn against all enemies prepared
And with the food of pride sustained my soul
In solitude
Sad was I, to pain depressed
Importunate and heavy load
My destiny has found me here
Upon this lonely road
And many thousands now are sad
Wait the fulfilment of their fear
For I must die who is their stay
Their glory disappears
Now I am dead and gone, my friend
Life's pain has come to end
Your star will guide my soul
To ride the winds above
How countless they congregate
Over our tumultuous snow
Which flows in shapes as tall as trees
When wintry winds do blow
Upon this star I fixed my eye
And rode over the wide, wide lands
My horse moved on, hoof after hoof
He raced and never stopped again
As if with keenness for our fate
Our faltering few steps on
To white rest, and a place of rest
Yet tomorrow grows with no love or hate
Those stars like some snow-white
Like some snow-white marble eyes
How countless they congregate
Over our tumultuous snow
Which flows in shapes as tall as trees
When wintry winds do blow
Upon this star I fixed my eye
And rode over the wide, wide lands
My horse moved on, hoof after hoof
He raced and never stopped again
As if with keenness for our fate
Our faltering few steps on
To white rest, and a place of rest
Yet tomorrow grows with no love or hate
Those stars like some snow-white
Like some snow-white marble eyes
How countless they congregate
O'er our tumultuous snow
Which flows in shapes as tall as trees
When wintry winds do blow
Upon this star I fixed my eye
And rode over the wide, wide lands
My horse moved on, hoof after hoof
He raced and never stopped again
As if with keenness for our fate
Our faltering few steps on
To white rest, and a place of rest
Yet tomorrow grows with no love or hate
Those stars like some snow-white
Like some snow-white marble eyes
Still here I wake and I think of you
I see you, I see you far away
Answer my call, can you hear my voice?
I hear you...
For we are gone and forever lost
Broken I lie, broken here I lie
Beneath, the shadows sink where daylight dies
I wake for you...
But here I stand and think of
The days the grass was green and my heart was so young
They've never been past
Forever lost...
In better lands the sun may shine
And green leaves on trees spring
Opening in its blossoming
And hear the raven sing...
For we are gone and forever lost
Broken I lie, broken here I lie
Beneath, the shadows sink where daylight dies
I wake for you...
Wars of great kings and clash of armouries
Whose swords no man could tell, whose spears
Were numerous as wheat field's ears
Rolled over all the great lands, and seas
Were loud with navies, their devouring fires
Behind the armies burned both fields and towns
And sacked and crumbled or to flaming pyres
Were cities made, where treasuries and crowns
Kings and their folk, their wives and tender maids
Were all consumed. Now silent are those courts
Ruined the towers, whose old shape slowly fades
And no feet pass beneath their broken ports
I need no call of clamant bell that rings
Iron tongued in the towers of earthly kings
Take a ride on, ride on,
on your rotting horse
on that deadly ground
Take a ride, ride on,
on your rotting horse
with a pounding sound.
Here on the stones and trees there lies a spell
Of unforgotten loss, of memories more blest
than mortal wealth.
Here undefeated dwell the fog immortal
under withered elmes,
Alalminore one in ancient realms
Farewell we call to the earth and hall
Though wind may blow so fast rain may fall
We must away ere break of day
For over wood, tree and mountain tall.
With foes ahead, behind us dread
Beneath the sky's our bed
Until at last our toil be passed
Our journey's done with sped
Beneath the moon and under a tall star
I wandered so far from northern lands
Bewildered on enchanting charming ways
So far from the days of mortal lands
From gashing of the narrow ice so near
Where shadows lie frozen on the hills top
From neither heats and burning glowing waste
I'm turning in haste and fear.
What I am, I must not show
What I am thou could not know
Something between heaven and hell
Something that neither stood nor fell
Far less happy, for we have
Help nor hope beyond the grave
And this is all that I can show
And this is all that you may know
A year there is a lifetime
And a second but a day
And an older would will meet you
Each morning you come away
The thunder's noise is our delight
And lightning makes us day by night
And in the air we dance on high
To the loud music of the sky
Neither substance quite, nor shadow
Haunting lonely moor and meadow
Dancing by the haunted spring
And riding on the whirlwinds wing
A year there is a lifetime
And a second but a day
And an older would will meet you
Each morning you come away
The thunder's noise is our delight
And lightning makes us day by night
And in the air we dance on high
To the loud music of the sky
I sit beside the fire and think
Of how the world will be
When winter comes without a spring
That I shall ever see
I sit beside the fire and think
Of people long ago
And people who will see a world
That I shall never know
I sit beside the fire and think
Of older times that were before
I listen for returning feet
And voices at my door
On high above the mists I came
A distant flame before the sun
A wonder ere the waking dawn
Where grey the nordlands waters run
In elder days and years of yore
Now behold the awful price of treason
Through dreams I influence mankind.
The holy trinity is rotten
All the saints are slain
Religion is forgotten
To the winged demon-lord we pray
We will rule
If not now, than in eternity
Maybe you win in this world
But the universe of black divine
Remains immortal
Get one of us in this reality
We sacrifice hundrets of yours
In our true reality
Hell
The dark age is our aim
To rule of mankind
This worthless brainless piece of shit
That remained of gods ridiculous creation
Our unit shows the sign of Satan
The master in black
Obey or be obliterated
His kingdom
Kingdom of Darkness
Where you can hear agony screams
Cry eternal
Frozen moon, growing shadows
Glowing eyes are waiting
The creator of darkness will rise
And the sun will shine no longer
Cry eternal
Condemned to walk away in the night
In the land where cold winds blow
Where silence reigns
From horizon to horizon
The wind leads your way
Darkness fills your soul
You'll be eternal in his kingdom
Kingdom of Darkness
Embalmed in black
Receive thy might
Our sense of live to harm world
Under the shining moon
We follow your command
Entering your unholy path
Kingdom of Darkness
Unable to save the world
But able to suffer in this so-called heaven
Your grotesque vision of pure holyness
Will be suffocated like you
bearer of light
Cry bearer of light
To weak to fight
Your fear
Your death
Eye to Eye at Armageddon
You say god is strong
You say god is eternal
I say this are lies
Unable to save the world
But able to suffer in this so-called heaven
Your grotesque vision of pure holyness
Will be suffocated like you
Cry bearer of light
To weak to fight
But we meet again - Eye to Eye
Victory at Armageddon
Marching through the woods
Our weapons held high
Here is our meeting tonight
Our fire burns higher then ever before
Out master's awaited with pride
We get immortality
We are eternal
We drink the blood flowing warm from christ
So sweet to taste the liquid might
Our satanic unity is done
Join force Belial
Hypnotic trance
Awaiting the beast
Waiting for the end
Whispering voices telling me
To rape to kill the priest
Floating caused by magic
Never ending hate
So we reached our aim
The replacement of day
The obliteration of the sun
The triumph of the soft moonlight
Mankind reduced so much
How deep my slumber is
You are not the one you think
We are masters - you are slaves
Why weeping?
Why bleeding?
Did you believe in the false god?
I'm laughing
I'm celebrating
I have foreseen my triumph
Now we are divided
But we know our time will come
Than we take our weapons
To stand together as one
Mankind exist to follow
To serve and not to think
We are born of the ancient race
To lead you in total darkness
Counts and lords with black blood
United under the funeral moon
The second wave of darkness
Is to be invocated
Darkness created
Dark age foreseen
The process of freezing
In my soft vision in blood
My lord, I say I'm yours
You're my mentor
I'll learn to take control over mankind
I'll be the leader of your unholy legions
To your victory on earth
We will your enemies the christians
My lord, I say I'm yours
I say I'm yours, my lord I'm yours
Speak the ancient words to cause the eclipse
Embalmed in black receive thy might
In sin we live
In sin we die
Join force Belial
Satanic unity
Meet us out there
Forests pride, moons beauty
Satans power, journey's end
Eternal darkness
Ancient!... we invoke
The polarities are united as one
We are united as one
By oaths once sworn by blood
The powers of darkness are unleashed
Fire of Surt engulfes the world
Fenrir unbound...
Midgard drowned by the sea
The chains of Fenrir are rent asunder
And the wolf shall course about...
An axe-age, a sword-age...
Come forth to receive the mark of fate
And prepare yourself for battle
The sun shall darken
Vapour and fire shall rage together
until the leaping flame licks heaven itself...
That the earth will be renewed in splendour
And Surt shall endure, as Baldur endures...
...For the powers of darkness are eternal
The twilight as come
The dawn breaks in the east
The world is alive
Loki lives upon the earth
It is done...
The fire engulfs the earth
Fenrir is free
the stars are falling
I'm the one behind the shadows
Tyrant of damnation
Believer in war
I will build the bridge of hate
To walk on pagan ways
In the light of the moon
...Hate in my heart
I wander through fire
To the valley of the shadow
I summon my inner self to strengthen my final will
I will destroy the promised land of God
To set the mighty flame
Flame
thou of wisdom the greatest
And to rise the hidden words
The words of ancient knowledge
The scars in the wind
Guide my path to the dark
Into my cold frozen reality
...This is the dawn of the final war
The victory is written in my flesh
I laugh as my enemies fall
And the sun will retire
Into the darkness of the night
Forever
I enter the gates
Into the realm where nothing dies
But I'm still so cold inside
Mesmerized...
By visions past and gone
Till the end of time
I will eternally dwell
In the darkest of storms
May crumble the dungeonwall
That bound me almost endlessly
And delightful and free may pilgrimage
My soul into the unknown land
I fly with the raven
Through timeless spheres of frost...
Through wasted lands of dreams
Fled from reality
for eternities
And on the other side of the blackness
An endless sea of greyness extends...
A sea of formless emptiness
Yet the misery and the pain remain
As memories of passed time
Proud yet desperate...
And deep inside I hope
that my life is just a dream...
The moon is my blanket
In this cold domain
So ancient
so cold...
As a nightmare creature I crawl
Awakened from my sleep
To forever be...
Wiedergeboren...
Bei den drei Monden durch Mittwinters Tore
Reborn...
By the three moons through midwinter's gates
I'm a shadow on haunted ground
Laughing in sorrow
Crying in lust
The storm is calming and death is rising
Evil
as pure as night
Proud
full of sin
Once again I'll rise...
To survive eternity...
Waiting for a painless death
The flames of hell are nothing
Compared to this life,
Full of woundlicking light,
Surrounded by atrocities called humans
Not worth a drop of blood.
My soul left this world
A long time ago,
But the everlasting hate bound my body
to this dimension.
I wander restless and empty,
Seeking deliverance and harmony,
Knowing that this search has no use, endless.
Someone had the power
And robbed the last hope from me,
The courage to end this misery, my life.
My wish could be fulfilled
Fade away, softly and certain,
On winterwings in the last
And eternal darkness,
In the icewind blow through my hair.
Comets are burning souls,
That have to travel through the cosmos for punishment.
Nothing disturbs this transcendental harmony
The only light that breaks up darkness
Are the burning red stars
Cosmic winds bear a waft
Of a gigantic psychic force
That the nineth dimension
colossal deep universe holds
And opens for me
Desolation in purest shape
Neither melodies nor cries
Resound in this cold silence
Nevertheless I feel the endless echo of melancholy
No mountain, no tree, no lake
But an endless wasteland of stones and ice
Forms this realm where no king was ever born
Because no life exists which can be ruled
Here is the destination of my astral journey
The only place where I find peace
So I leave the world behind
And replace earthbound grey
To interstellar black
I leave the world behind!
Buried beneath forgotten cryptic stones
Enshrined in silence, embraced by darkness
Belonging to the hidden ancient race
Am I still dead but dreaming
Awaiting my time of resurrection
Reminisce of a day long ago in past
When I was blessed with the dark kiss
The gift which immortalized me once
Oh... I do remember the taste of hot blood
Which was running upon my white face
To moisten my dry lips
With a burning kiss of mortality
A burning kiss of mortality
My eyes are blazing red in the night
Leather wings adorn my huge back
My fangs are sharp as frozen steel
Prepared to caress thy beloved neck
I rise from the tombworld, folding out my wings
Flying up high through the nocturnal sky
Looking for cretures who are worthy
To get the dark kiss
And to satisfy my hunger for blood
During this night
I do feel again the taste of hot blood
My fangs are mutilating thy sweet flesh
It's the painful bite of the dark kiss
Vampires kiss..
The blood is the life
Flying silent on winter wings
Flowing emotions from my bleeding soul
Tears that flow burn my skin
I'm drifting away on the cold wave of desolation
I'm touching the wind as it sadly sings
Carried to the disant unknown
Eternity awaits me...
My heart is so cold
Emotions reached their freezing point
...Only pure hate
Lost all that I was living for
Crying without sound
Thy sky has frozen to ice
As the last drops of blood leave my body
I hear the winter breath
I'm the face of the night
I'm all alone
The fullmoon is glowing
Snow falls from the sky
I feel the eternal winter
Holocaust winds are rising
Like a dark northern breeze
My cryptic journey has just begun
...And so my mind is calm
Ready for the darkest eons
Candlelight caresses my eyes
Incense smoke displaces soiled air
This trip is part of an endless journey
I'm Satan and Satan is me
Finding myself through this experience
Wash away all that ever was...
My life is a funeral ceremony
As I march through the mortals' graves
I obey deepest inner instincts
And gain the endless power of darkness
To place the seed of evil
Right in the heart of the earth
...And all ancient power manifests as shadows
Which darken not only my heart and soul
But the holy light of all that dare to stand
Against the forces of the black flame
In the night when the moon had a thousand faces
The secret was revealed to me
And instead of the skin in the human faces
I saw only dark spiderwebs
Wolves are howling to honour the moon
My heart belongs to the past
I feel attraction for the night
My mind to the ancient times
I wander through the fields where blood was split
Awaiting the reign of the dark and the cold
I can feel the creatures of the night
My dreams are no illusions
So I travel between these worlds
My soul is frozen
evil rules my mind
Able to face the eternal night
Why am I born into this world
...Soon I will leave
Into the sleep of death
never to return
My life is just a darkened silent barricade
Between all I ever wanted to be
I will enter the other side
To fly on the wings of death
To ride with the wind to the ancient times
To fade away to a blackened spiral
to see eternity
To be a wintershadow out of time
Mark my words
for I speak the truth and foresee
I've seen the winged shadow
The harbinger of the upcoming storm
And warriors which gathered
And inflamed their pagan hearts
I've read the dark signs and foretell you
The final battle under the hammer
Of the banished gods...
I sent black birds to the sky
I set a sign for my hate
To darken the day
To beat back the light
Winds storm above this wasteland
A first flickering of rage
Dark clouds keep me sheltered
Don't move before moonrise
Don't move before moonrise
We gather in the name of our pagan ancestors
The teutonic spirit burns in our hearts
What once was ours will be taken back
Rising our tribe like the upcoming winter-age
Upcoming winter-age
Like in the ancient days
We honour the cryptic place
Where we receive our visions
Was christian blood sacrificed
Hell is real
I feel its presence
Staring with empty eyes
Into an empty sky
Nothing is here to feel
I drift like a falling leaf
The wind takes me into the unknown
Where is all the hate
All the pain
Staring with empty eyes
Into an empty sky
Nothing is here to feel
I drift like a falling leaf
The wind takes me into the unknown
Where is all the hate
Just pure devastation to darkness
Hate
absolute and pure
Existence in this mass is impossible
To stand in their lines
Is to fight amongst enemies
I'm not human
For they are called humans
They bleed
I become stronger
Their fear
my pride
God is dead
now we'll slaughter his following too
The limit is reached
untamed devastation
Moving down every breathing entity
Our wrath
our weapons are too real to ignore
Mercy
a forgotten word
aimless, blind 
just storming against everything
The gods you banished in the ancient days
Have still been worshipped by ones you fear
They gathered powr which you now loose
As your god fails by your side
The two ravens are there to pick your eyes
As we cry out the names of the pagan gods
We loaf around the fireplace
War-weary and calm
We watch the sunrise motionless
The war has been won
We hear melodies unsung
Mesmerized...
We survived
but why?
A new beginning
for what?
Too cooled down to move
We just stare and lay back to die
The holocaust is over
victory
All is dead
burnt debris
Everlasting silence
we reached peace of mind
We just stare and lay back to die
Not a senseless life
but extinguished now
This is the long awaited end
Not pain
a sort of harmoney I feel
As I look back
staring at my body
Lifeless
but not without bearing
Realizing that the mission is done
As I leave the earth I'm not alone
All the brave warriors who fought on my side
Fly with me to our last place of rest
Is it the silvery shine of the moon that surrounds us
Or is it the path to the halls of eternal glory
Never thought to be so calm
As my soul leaves this dimension forever
Never to return
But wrapped in knowledge we found fulfillment
Forever...
Spectral planes before my eyes
Ambivalent growing with my inner pandemonium
Crimson horizons merge into ashen skies
Ascending bleakness but not colourless
I stride ahead...
Light-absorbing signs appear above me
Symbols to guide me, symbols to brace me
Impressed by these views which I always foresaw
Hearing the silent resonance of everlastingness
A cosmos that never began and will never pale
So do I...
Time and space like warmth and coldness
All earthly concepts left behind
Harmonious evil beyond faintness fills this world
My senses are adapted, obtuse they were
I have spiritualized the flame of Satan
So these eternal impressions are wages
For every life destroyed in a fake outstripped reality
Obscure are the ways of death
And veiled are mine...
Secrets and treasures can be bared in a place called... hell
The relevance of mortality descends after this revelation
And I have banned all christian mortality
One day I enter my morbid world
And stalk on endless paths
Where crimson horizons merge into ashen skies
As the wan moon
the 6th of the hidden
Takes his position
My body trembles in blasphemic delight
Obsessed I awaited this day
As the planets arrive
And unveil the powers of ages for me
Surrounded by a beam of light
The seven stars burn in line
I chant the first words of wisdom
And the earth is covered in deepest blackness
Mankind falls into chaos
Everything returns to its origins
I use a wand of silver
To draw the lines in the air
I use a wand of gold
To reign in blood and fire
For this is the time to channel my forces
To purify the surface of my planet
All celestial bodies form an almighty sign
Eerie constellation is a beginning
Eerie constellation is an end
The light I see is none...
It doesn't shine, doesn't murder the dark
Was not created by the white one
Not existing for your undimensional eyes
The black I see in none...
Not a shattering, but a creating one
A spectrum of unreal colours
And a thrust for your numb existence
You are alive, I am not
You are dead, I'll never be
My face is an earthly mask I never asked for
So I'll leave it behind and will never return
Longing for worlds which my astral mind has seen
Here I stand, flesh and blood
Laughing and crying, betraying the earth
But have you really even thought this shell is me?
As your reality crashes into the void
I sit beside Satan and watch you die
We are the ones in the mist
Are the darkness breed
We pity the one with the horns
And gaze at the hypnotizing starfire
Without words we communicate
Without battles we dominate
Wings for the wind, bones from the woods
One with nature, never alone
Our origin is unknown
Destination never shown
We never serve and never reign
Sacrifices for the stars, swords for the moon
Thorns and stones for your believes...
A cosmos with one colour but thousand shades
Universe of triumphant souls
For you not to feel, not to see
Your water is no blood
Your music no magick
Search beyond the stars
Nevertheless you can't find us
Our world does not exist
And we never lived
I am your inmost self
I gaze out upon thy world of coloured lights from the darkness
The darkness behind thine eyes
I am the most ancient one, the creator of the gods
I am the changing and the changeless one
I am the source of all that is
In what thou calleth dreams, I gather my forces
In what thou calleth reality, I stage my dreams
I am the true god, the only god which is
My dragon magic is sweet, for I will never grant thee thy wishes...
I drink the life essence of those who exist only to serve my will
Your dreams are my life, the bridge between the
Transcendental metamorphosis take place
As certain as the night follows the day
Your mortal human avoidance of hurt feeling" will cause you to feel
The pain of thy death
Realize that the powers of the dreams are five, dimensions unseen...
Astral reflections have immortalized me once, in a time before time
What follows is the breaking of the seventh seal
The final harvest is close, see the banner of the winged skull of UR
The gates of the greatest power shall be flung open
To the farthest reaches of all possible universe...
Your world will be swept up with the agony of billions
I am the undead who've risen, but time grows short for me
I am patient because I am eternal
I am an elder god, the vampire lord
bow down before me
Founding myself on a heath of light...
A great white tower before my eyes
Voices of sorrow, never heard nor beheld
I'm trapped
beyond my dark sky
And the glaring light burns my eyes
All colours look like sunlight's swords
The dimly light seems to be lost...
I'm gazing through this window,
Without moving, as if I had been there forever
The horizon of dreams...
I see a black raven flying
somewhere someone's dying
But all the moon revealed again and leaped my forces back to life
Now I feel harmony... showered by the moonlight...
My mocking laughter rang out to be resounded in the circle of time
And I rode back like the wind
into my beloved realm
And i leave thy heaven... 
forever...
My black cloak flew like wings behind me,
As I fly through the freezing fire
And the cries of falling souls encourage me
But the dreamworld will open its gates again...
Soon I'll reach towards your soul from the grave
And not to hand my heart on you
Because I am not the shade you're waiting for
My wings stir the moonlit dust of the place in which the past is buried
In this forest of wolves which is my home
Some things lighten nightfall... 
feel my presence...
Hurry up and hide you from your desire
you godforsaken whore!
What luck are you waiting for?
Your sins will never be forgotten!
The swiftness of time is a joke for me,
And I still feel the taste of your flesh on my lips
As it was in the beginning, it's now, and ever shall be...
Oh beloved blood
I am thy bitterness, I am immortal... 
and hunting eternally...
The taste of tears is bitter
But the taste of revenge is sweet...
Thy flesh is weak -
But I am not from this time
Just like the wind...
Gazed upon future dimensions
Through the spectral shadowlights...
The portal of my fate appears... 
soon...
Life may have mercy but I've none
You can never guess what hell is like
Not a sea of fire...
Nor you'll find chains of ice...
But the word of God is unknown there
Nothing is what it seems
The dismal truth is so hard to face
You're just living in a dream
fear the awakening...
Now enter my castle of pain
Cross the path of sorrow and fear
There'll be no light until your soul ignites
until your soul ignites
Realise the truth...
I am the lord upon the nightsky
And I'll never serve in heaven
because I rule in hell
But I am still dreaming
Unsilent...
Freezing winds of lands unnamable
Haunts the wastes of my soul
And time has come to join eternity...
To rest my eyes upon the darker shade of colour
This is the end and the beginning
As dimensions warped in time's motionless storms
The long awaited circle is close
And the gates stand open wide before me
Lie down and let your dreams attack
The silence of a soul that is real
Is the silence that you lack
I feel the strength pulsating through me
As I close the gates behind you
I slayed love disguised as fear
And time itself touches my soul
Satan
the fire still burns within my soul
And with lifeless eyes I stare
A way out but not back I must find
A can no longer crawl through this life I hate
Soon I'll be thrown to the wolves again
And the balance returns again
When mind and body unite...
I close the temple of my mind
Throughout so many lifetimes
In this dimension I've dwelt...
But I've never forgotten
Nor will I ever forgive
My thoughts have never been this cold in life
But never again I'll live and breathe amongst mortals
You've summoned me once
And my rise is your torment...
Your immortality was that close to you
As close as your death now
And now I watch you die my mortal slaves
I cause realities end...
Listen
a whispering, a crying
Some vague and pulsing imprint
Of long ago suffering and death
Thousands will be perished in smoke and ashes
Imagine your lifetime back when you were born
It's lost...
All over the world your kind will be destroyed
This is my rebirth
don't cry...
On the path of immortality
I walk
I am forever with the stars so plentiful and bright
The gorgeous victory of sheer energy and matter
This is my constellation
reflected in you fear
Through dark tangles of mountainsides I descend
And no other God is as strong as I am
I am Satan...
The lustrous and overwhelming scorn
And all I see, as I stand above this ancient landscape
Is the horror and death that awaits you...
My wings flare in the cold wind
The delicious stench of blood make me laugh
And for one moment I've felt harmony
As I've seen mankinds end...
Enter the path to the realm below
Where evil sleeps and darkness grows
For you don't know where I've been
And you don't know what I've seen
You can't feel what I felt
And you can't go where I've dwelt
For I am the blood you bleed
And the death you'll see
I am the sign of Satan
To bring forth the night
Infernal chanting..
As the secrets revealed before my eyes
Lost for evermore, lost in nevermore
As I've wept one thousand tears
And dreamed one thousand dreams
Now here I stand, flesh and blood
My soul reflects a stream of ice
As your blood flows in the dark
Your fears are calling as I left my mark
So here's my confession
Yet far beyond expression
For I am death and I am birth
Your incarnated fear
And when you're dead you'll dream of me
Live in your illusions
Die in your illusions
Restless throughout unseen dimensions
I've wandered
Now I stand forth to challenge
The laws of man and god
I'll rise the banner of the strong
for earth shall be mine
My hate are the stars
But soon they'll fall
Shivers herald an upcoming possesion
The urges to create set us ablaze
Demonic art sacrificed to the night
A monument of malicious sonority
The most precions gift
For the everlasting cycle
For the beginning and the end
For the comprehensive darkness
For master Satan and ourselves
Millions of unsignificant existences
Exceeded by our tones supreme
Melodies older than mortality
Enormous as death itself
The chosen ones have command of the language
That needs neither mouth nor words
Our minost soul transformed into notes
We are element as well as entirety
So what is paradise if not hell
Souls of infidel men
Is a fertile soul
Like dusky forest grow
On fallen leaves
We draw the essence of mortal weakness
Holyness
The worst gift of light
Is long dead and gone
Buried by our sisters ages ago
Whilst the sun rapes the day
Grow borns below
Armoured and strengthened
Are the sons of the moon
And not blood keeps us alive
Souls of infidel men
Flow through our veins
One last silent scream
One last breath
The moment we appear from the shadows
To inhale another soul
Of an infidel man..
Red interludium of pain
Sacrifice for the vein of eternity
Battles of ages revealed
To my third eye
Darkness' treasures as reward for my belief
I faint in final ecstasy
Surrender to the demon of war
Proud and dauntless I stalk
Trough the gate of the nine seals
In the realm of perpetual divinity
A path is destined for me
Now, as I'm not blinded
By gruesome lights of the past
I gaze into the distance
And perseive my destination
For many a castle is obscurity
For me a palace of wisdom
Redeemed from mortal weakness
Enlightened
Every single christian monument
We lay in ruins
And sweep away the servants of the cross
We are the creators of the dark ages
The revival Of forgotten century's eclipse
We rebuilt a somber paradise
Out of the wasteland of god
I bear the millenium's pain
Pure indulgence
As my mouth opens breathing death
Unreal revealed this imagination
A dream so real, a dream so deep
Turning me towards all mysteries
I see through the veil of darkness
And the mirror behind it reflects my fate
But the way is blocked By sorrow
I scream into non-existing nothingness
And at last only silence remains
Oh, make every tear in my heart
A lifetime in hell
Falling eternal through the pits of time
Into an abysmal womb of subconsciousness
Torn apart by the phenomenon of enlightenment
And here she was standing enrobed by mist
The spirit of Venus..
Chanting my name
Embracing my soul
The blood was freezing as I touched the flesh
And ripped out her heart
A kiss which brought total eclipse
Unite us in pain
Unite us in blasphemy and lust
And join us through your devotion
Grant me deepest ecstasy
Under the watching autumn eye
That has guided me through all this year
And in the coldness of night
I whisper the wildest dreams unto you
While I am shrouded
By crystals of frosty dusk
And the everlasting winter
Embraces my heart with grief
This soil is dripping
With the blood of angels
I can almost touch
Their hands through the ground
My eyes are filled with pride
For this land of the dead
Is the precious gift of my father
No mortal value can buy such a treasure
Which I cherish in my heart of hearts
Satan with fangs stained in blood
Smile to my naive dreams
This unhallowed ground
Secret sanctuary of my thoughts
Where I walk hand in hand with death
Upon blood and soil
Oh, don't mind any pain
It gives me wisdom
My rage is my strength
It gives me might
But something inside me seems to be lost
Is there hope for the blood of life?
Or will I always fly alone..
Those who are in Hell
Hallowed be thy name
This is for you who made me what I am
For the storm that tries
To shake my roots
Is just the breath of the dying god
Who once ruled heaven
But he won't succed
As long as I stand true to my ways
And even I am alone
I can't remember what I'm missing
Awakening
Although I thought I would never again
In a room with no begining or end
But for sure there is a center
Nothing but vastness
And an object of supreme magic
A mirror shaped as a pyramid
Black but still reflecting
My hands and arms but not my face
I'm watching myself moving
Towards this blasphemy
Attracted I float nearer and nearer
Trying to step aside
But my journey ends behind the glass
A sea coloured red is awaiting me there
Everything is upside down
Am I destined to drown
Surfaces belong to other dimensions
Hell is above
And heaven awaits far below
Deeper and deeper I sink
And scream without sound
Unrealistic reality or a dream
In the state of being awake
For sure this will be
My greatest victory or my final defeat
If I am demon all the angels must die
Silent screams
Beaten and torn
Sanctify
This life of scorn
Innocence withdrawn in fear
Night grows cold and twilight's near
But the light I see is none
Just a spectrum of unreal colours
Which appears before my eyes
For you neither to see, nor to feel
Shattered scattered
Remnants of life
What can be extracted from nothing
What can be found within the emptiness
Within the emptiness from which I am fed
I deal in pain
All life I drain
Cherished
The grandeur of melancholy
Always and never
The skyline seems so unreal
If I had wings, would I be forgiven
If I had horns, would there be flames
..To show my cry
Laughing and crying
Nothing remains
No future and no past
No one could foresee
The end has come so fast
And I reach my hand
Towards this ocean of despair
To grant my soul a lifetime in hell
A newborn day waits to surrect
But what will cover dawn?
Neither begging nor pleading will find ears
When all the angel hordes have gone to war
For a final twisted dance
A twisted dance into death
Writhe within the emptiness
Writhe because there lurks endless pain
To satisfy our brothers slain
To satisfy our sisters drained in flames
The dark age shall rise again
And ten for one we will revenge what has been done
Bathe in flames to clean your souls
Your silent screams guide your eternal fall
One another you will tear
Your flesh out of your bodies burnt by fear
Now keep your breath and feel inside
Can you feel... it's the time
Is this judgement day?
We feel the signs supporting us
But shall the moonlight bathe again our midnight prayers
To reach the aim we're longing for
To rise up from the human dust we dwelled this earth
The trust in us and victory
Drives us against our enemy
Our kingdoms we are dreaming of
And hoping gives us sense to be
So let us bring an end to this
And lead the first hit to the faces
Of the crowds out of the light
For broken now lies all their might
From all directions coming in trembling with fear
The herd of God sentenced to death
I lead the first sword strike to eternity
You cannot flee from certain death
When dawn has come this final day pass with your dying breath
A hunger for insanity within illusions infinity
A heart of dreaming ice and burning flesh caught in passion
The ultimate pain shines as a star upon God
And his creation that gaze at the horizon of the dead
A source of tranquility obscure the mind
Paralysed by abyssmal revelations
Endless oceans formed by skulls
Pandemonic outbreaks cause chaos within the universe
Blood for Satan
Tears of God
Lords from beyond fly through the astral skies
From the ashes of burning hell
Satan's legions rise again
To sweep upon earth in flames' disguise
Within the gloomy eyes
You always saw the darkness rise
So think about it
Because it's the last moment you will remember
Forever burning in your mind
The cruel and ruling all consuming unity
Obtained is now this crystal throne
That once upon a time unfolded before my inner eye
Extinguished equilibrium
While I became immortal
Time itself flows through my veins
As I rise my sword in lust for battle
The battle to feed my raging thirst for blood
As my soul reach the plateau of everlasting wisdom
That laid hidden for milleniums - unknown, unseen
For I am the harbinger of a new age
The age that rise between my outstretched arms
As I lick the blood of your flesh
The age that rise as I inhale your dying breath
While the sun and the moon falls down between my fingers 
subconscious
Glassy tunnels reveal upon this wisdom's flame
The flame, a shivering mirror that reflects my osseous face
Bloodred are enlightened my bleak eyes that saw worlds crash
Into to the void, the void an empty abyss you call reality
Apocalypse pass by
As I settle down in the crystal throne to close my eyes
But is this really what I am striving for
An everlasting existence without any challenge
But what's an assignment for a god of the superior race
In the ancient tradition of conjuration
To satisfy my bestial urge
I raise blackened magic to the heavens, against the light
So appear and bring forth my desire
Flesh is the slave
my spirit reigns
As naked servant to my rite
enslaved creation
Raging wildfire for ritual soul cremation
No flame burns brighter than desire
Lust and passion, and pain as sinful gift
Wildfire in the heart of man
uncontrollable
I'm the creature set ablaze with God's despised sin
Grant me irresistibility
power infinite
Let open up the earth to spew whores
Sexual rites to praise your name
No flame burns brighter than desire
Lust and passion, and pain as sinful gift
Wildfire in the heart of man - uncontrollable
I'm the creature set ablaze with God's despised sin
Forgive me father for I've sinned
I am a child of fire and the master of winds
But I'm still wide awake...
Fingers grip out of my brain
No control
my mind is lame
From the earth up to the trees I hear them calling me
The voices which rides on the breeze
Oh, its haunting me
in expectancy for your flesh
But this dream life is the only life
An everlasting astral dimension
The dream death is the only death
Total destruction of the soul
Within this astral plane I'll never be the same
Throwing myself at the sky while falling back to the ground
I'm off the earth but no one can hear my painful sound
I open the doors to the other side and step beyond mortality
Trapped in rage
it bursts my veins so feel the pain
I breathe your name
It isn't just a nightscape vision painted in blood
Utopia Consumed!
The dark silhouettes move towards me
As I confess the morbid desire
And I witness all the falling souls consumed
Only one night is missing
But this one will bring the storm that put an end to everything
The sky is still starlit, but if our faith, our desire is forceful enough
The strings of silence hushed
The strings of silence smooth
Within a few hours all signs will read storm
Listen!
It is true that there exist individuals
Who are never looking prouder
Warliker then the rising of the storm
Many-voiced the singing rises
The air seems to condense
Filled with electric sparks
Starting to fly, to rotate, to spin
To oscillate in the centre of the magical circle
The voices sound higher
Coil-linke circling and narrowing
The light rises faster and faster
The voices resemble blowing wind, howling wolves
The silence break hissingly
The storm put on it's strings
The strait looks like a witch's cauldron
Like a hotblooded foaming geyser
The elements are in uproar
Now all signs are stormy
It's insignia are shining dark ablaze
A shining ablaze from a violent encounter of sulphur and lead
Everything is out of breath
Everything is beside itself
storm world!
In the shadow of heavy wings
Sorceresses preserver
In their fluttering clothes resist the beating weather
That almost tear the garments of our bodies
Flashes in the eye
Endless high pulsating coil
Is rising from the cone
A magical and miraculous horn
Of a unicorn whose top gets lost in infinity
Sparks spray, thunders beat, lightnings are inflamed
That the air is filled with the claps of heavy wings
The apocalyptic wildness of the storm
Who's now reigning with a brachial power unleashed despot
The string of the storm!
The storm of hell that never halts there
It drives the ghosts and demons in it's vortex
Everlasting, for the fatal and glorious return of our master...
Through imperial halls of ice
Where I left bloodstained pillars
Resplendent seem these silver walls
Silent phantoms I burn
Towards the emptiness
Towards the gorge
Onwards, onwards... to hell, to hell
I was the could through which angels fell
Onwards, onwards... to hell, to hell
I was torture, death and fatal spell
Onwards through another vortex of colours
To hell where I left devouring darkness
Onwards 
opaque visions I haunt
To hell impervious seem these delusive lights
My journey begun
As you unveiled my face
As I ripped of my skin
And my demon was roused
Thrones and dominions mean nothing to me
As long as I seek the truth
Thus I break man and ice
On my journey towards beyond
Melting in the heat
Beloved Succubus I lick your lips in fever dreams
Pandora sweet
Your hot flesh sucks on mine as I flow deep into thee
My bride in red
In lust our souls ablaze scream with the winds of hell
My high priestess of death
Drowned in the seed of doom you spread
my blessed grim reaper
Writhing in you brute embrace
you breathe miasma
I taste your kiss of pestilence
Pandora
glorious countess of plague and fevers
Tears darken my eyes
Dripping on you naked breast
You lick my flesh
Greying, decaying by your touch, my body wreck
Convulsive grasp
My flesh is stricken, shivers run across my skin
I face my death, rape my fading life
And ride my fevery soul through thunderstorms in Hades' depths
you're the flesh untamed
I face my death unchained
Overwhelming fear
As all nightmares come to life
Extracted pain unfolds within this realm of fear
A change of visions extend my mind
Psychotropic pulse
I am the chosen one
Satan’s son
A flash of shivering stardust enlightens
The truth beyond the portals
Reality’s borders fade
replaced by liquid glass
Modulation tunes reveal
All your tears unleashed
All souls wrapped in plastic and wonder how
It must hurt to see all the fears unleashed
A battlefield of indescribable beauties
Like silver statues that glide
In everlasting oceans depths
Legions march onwards in their perpetual cycle
But soon our journey reach it’s end
And since ages I felt that kind of satisfaction
As my one and only axe strike hits the hand
Of my chosen victim that kneels crying before me
Oh how I enjoyed to see him cry and finally die
Now your prophetic redeemer is dead
But take a look around and understand
What has changed, say to do really miss him?
So forget all set up morals
And let eternal wisdom flow
Cosmic revelation
demonic incarnation
Collective concentration
total devastation
Psychotropic pulse
I am the chosen one
Satan’s son
A flash of shivering stardust enlightens
The truth beyond the portals
Set ablaze the fires of Satan
Interconstellar eclipse caused
By protoplasmic bombardments
Extraterrestrial invaders encompass the universe
Infernal invasion enchant me
Systematic obliteration
hate me!
Lifelessness invaders your eyes
Demonized, in fire baptized
Chaotic birth of a new domain
Static, emotionless
I am the repulsor
Corrosive spiritual fragments
Drowned in grey
I am the repulsor
Human factors fail again
Lifelessness invaders your eyes
Demonized, in fire baptized
Chaotic birth of a new domain
Static, emotionless
Hordes of bio machines
I am the master of
This is my legacy
repulsor!
I flight the war no one has fought
I am the wretch that’s never caught
Infected diffusion
repulsor!
Electrostatic aura, I am the catalyst
Life and death means nothing to me
Demonized 
genocide
demonized
Brutalized
demonized
brutalized
So bow down before me
Because resistance is futile
A fallout force
a fatal vision
Decolour the universe in its purest shape
Give birth to the constant of death
Immortality and departure of the eternal stardust
Reveal the eye of the phantom throne
Passage from another universe
Into the 7th dimension
Distortion and microcosmical revelation
Corrosive devastating fire
the rage takes us higher
Analyzed is now your mind
Neutralized the human kind
alignment of Satan
like a planet that explodes
For this is the dawn of the new age
Refuse unknown
glory to be shown
Electromechanical precision
Objects termination
Our legions are armed
mass murder, art
Collective homicide
fear worldwide
We’re the kings of starlight
The beast that tore from inside
Our legions are armed
mass murder, art
Collective homicide
fear worldwide
Life’s pain has come to an end
So face the demon unchained
And visualize fortress hell
Hail you forgotten gods
Sleeping the step of death
Return to blood soaked power
To fierce tyrants reign
They somnambulate on burning foots prints
Haunting black infinity
The shadows beyond the stars
Unholy flesh of shoggots distorting time and space
Black tentacles atrocious
mouldery slimy trace
Recover the lands of an eons lasting dream
To enslave all mortal life
And bring madness over men
Hail you forgotten gods
Sleeping the step of death
Receive my words
chaos arise!
Winds of time chase my prayers
Through the depths resurrect!
Wake the dead dreaming gods
Cthulhu thee who lurks beyond the threshold
Buried under black withered megaliths
Under cold and bare distant desert planets
In abyssmal depths beyond blinking stars
Fleshless bodies dream of a new return
Drunk now is my blood, opened is the path
Ancient Ones return, cosmic wrath unleashed
Voices chanting pain
scream from a thousand mouths
Forces raising dead mountains of flesh
Protoplasmic waves spilled from outer space
Transformed is my flesh, blackened now my heart
The triumphatic rise of the Ancient Ones
Invading land, sea and sky in their lust for chaos
An age of occult worship
To flesh turned fear in grey disguise
Has lead it’s trail for eons long
And eons more it will lead on until the galaxy declines
Yet Luna splits her gruesome rains
Of light over a world in fright
And while the tides of time pass by
The grey still walks these haunted planes
I am the heart of battle
I am the arm of warriors
My father, he gave me the heavens
My father, he gave me the earth
He who was alive yesterday
He who was alive is dead today
The thunders of wrath and judgement are numbered
And harbored in the earth, so open the gates
The voices travel with the wind
listen, feel it’s power
Fear is not! for in time it will reveal the true powers
The powers and the might of the black divine
The luminescence of darkness
Chaos
void of creation
Chaos rise
I am the one who comes forth of frost and show
With a shadow cast and soon unveils
The northern darkness glory
I am the angel that never felt
All the mysteries are mine
I lead you to rebirth though death and destruction
Just take my hand
For I am the angel that never left
All the mysteries are mine
I lead you to rebirth though death and destruction
I am the one who comes forth of frost and show
With a shadow cast now I unveil all
The northern darkness glory
Creation
understanding
Destruction
transformation
Renewal
wisdom
Just take my hand
Chaos
void of creation, chaos rise!
Chaos
it is done
Angel of death
Go forth into that dark night
On the narrow threshold stands a legion
United they sing out but one name
Sword to pointed sword
Wing to pointed wing
Language unpronounceable
For human tongue
for mortal senses
Lnaudible, yet loud as thunder
Cracking silence in that cave of winds
Azrael! Angel of death
Go forth into that dark night
You’re the lamp onto the realms of shadows
As you would enter the arms of your lover
Drawn me higher into the night skies!
Take my hand and guide me on this journey
Dispel fear with understanding
I am your temple
The temple within all evil dwells
All I am is light and shadow expressed in the manifest from
Orion, I lock my visions onto the stars
I am your Bipolar chaos
Of proud heart and valiant soul
Death zone
reflections in liquid glass
Cry tears
tears that gleam like falling stars
Death zone
barren planets teemed with life
As I warp my wings around this universe
And collect billions
Of souls
the souls that rope
Upon the planets surface
Glimmer as tiny blue flames
Vale of shadowed twilight spheres
Bearer of the millenium’s pain
Azrael! within, without, everywhere and nowhere
I am the essence of all life and death
What means imagination
If not the trigger
To pure hell?
The chaos nova of our vision
Closed the fissure of the night
After the mirror of the void was scared
By shapeless horns
Satan’s galaxy
Seeing through five triangular shapes
We are so close to this dimension
As the center erects a spiral
Uniting us without bridges
We swim in a chalice of cataklysm
The pentagrams dynamism
The chlorophyll of liquid dreams
Cloaks the lords of apocalypse
As the distortion in the tapestry shows me
What they cannot see
Reborn by the burial of syndrome
This pure flight of transparency
Mutating into the new circle of power
I gave death to whom
I gave death to me
An exchange of the links below
The geometry of madness fulfilled
I breed into new unzoned trance
United in parallel
Genetic eternities
By shapeless horns
Satan’s galaxy
It feels so cold tonight
My skin has turned to ice
Dead and gone are all emotions
Breeding pain enwraps
All the tears that wash away
Life's unreal
Values of joy and love
Pale are my eyes
frozen my heart
Time and space, life and death
Pale is my mind
stone cold my soul
I am the accuser that recreates hell on earth
For waits in yours restrictive
Three dimensional world?
Too late, too cold
none hides of the truth!
For I have seen
the prophecies foretold
Abstract realities crash into the void
A heaven built on non-provable facts
a lie?
The wisdom bursts
my veins as I Tremble in unreal delight
And even it hurts to belong to the knowing
An I not the fulfillment of all quests
Trust me you that bears the nuclear winter in his soul
I’ll pour out my soul
To show my inner strength
And wouldn’t you agree
If was the highest excitement you’ve felt?
So give me all your heart and I will take your life
For I am the reborn 
beast that will Extinguish all your mortal kind
Or might it be a too radical step to immortality?
But I thought you couldn’t await to enter
My heaven so accept it cause our time has come
I rise
you fall
Incapable of error... 
Human error...
And the earth was without form, and void
and darkness was upon the face of the deep
A sombre shade
Death has given warning
I knew it would come - 
The storm of all storms...
Freedom or hell?
The axis of sovereignty?
Open your eyes!
Come out of the dark!
Leave the house of death!
Face the unknown - 
Praise the failure itself, 
let him be your comrade in nothingness...
Oh, grand machine of desperation
Deliver thy sermon.
We will chant with you in a choir of void filled souls.
We feed you, god of the grotesque, our flesh shall serve you well.
Welcome to the realm of endless death, where we are nothing but slaves...
All colours are dead and unreal now, 
oh great kingdom of the withering...
The great deluge is about to come!
Hope dies with the wind...
A storm like a cold stare:
This is belief
This is above all knowledge!
Face the undeniable fact of death
Archetypes stay while the world dies away.
What a sinister bless for the few
Are you of the devil's seed or not?
I will burn this world in ecstasy!
I feel the hate rise up in me...
Release the demon
Unchained, set me free
For this is the gift of the goat.
Offer me a world to win!
Biomechanical Antichrist.
The one that never dies.
Welcome to my domain...
My heart that once raged in battles of fire now feels so old...
Still the taste of blood on my lips 
I just fix this problem with a blade...
Sharpen the dagger and open your veins!
Stone cold is death's bowl and all that's left is ash.
Death is not a punishment, just the gate that leads me into the ultimate existence...
You can't hide from your desire!
The flood of liquid lust
A flood of inhuman disgust
The essence of evil illuminates the soul.
Enjoy deepest ecstasy of unearthly kind...
Let us summon the horned master!
Let blasphemic passion flow!
Injection Satan
Now!
Deconstruction of fundamental nominalism
Total confusion of the self...
Is this land in God's possession
This land of frost?
Ultimate consequence shall be death
No bitterness
just empty shells of human flesh
No creation without a room
No being without a point of reference...
The path you have chosen doesn't exist anymore.
Don't search for the stars, even the moon is dead...
Just don't pray for death
Remember your birth!
Take the knife to practice the ultimate sacrifice!
Who else drinks from this pool of death only to remain alive?
When time stands still and sparks of burning flesh enlighten the glimmering horizon
Reality's borders fade, unreal...
It's hard to face the truth as your reality bursts...
Real pain defines what you forgot through your wasted life based on mortal morals.
Pain reveals the real existence, it leads to understanding:
If you seek life, then prepare for death.
The devil, great consumer of mortality, 
appears as the destroyer of cause and effect, and of God's linearity.
Hence man can be merged in His infinity.
Monument, oh mighty monument of time!
We're marching through the ongoing passage of time
Life eating... 
collapsing... 
drowning...
Pointed but without origin
Continuum... 
sequence... 
pendulum...
We provoke spiritual leadership
We step out of this miserable race
We become one with His principle
We are one
We invoke the magnificent purity
We invoke the almighty black flame
We become one with His principle
We are one
we are none
Locked and trapped inside thy self
Thou shalt never be free
Dissecting process marches on
Without limitation
A solemn decay procession
Cycles structuring around thee
Like a maelstrom
A time to kill and a time to heal
A time to tear down and a time to build up
A time to weep and a time to laugh
A time to mourn and a time to dance
A time to throw stones and a time to gather stones
A time to embrace and a time to shun embracing
A time to search and a time to give up as lost
A time to keep and a time to throw away
A time to tear apart and a time to sew together
A time to be silent...
And a time to speak
You seem to be separated in entities
Consumed and erased you creep and crawl
A sequence of extermination
Constellations evolve out of prima materia
Periodically transforming and enduring
Focusing on metamorphosis
Where shall all this lead to?
Grand Master Satan lead us through!
Time
father 
reaper
Life eater
Time is Satan's way of keeping everything from happening at once.
Perpetual cycle devoid of all logic
So cold and bare of all reason
When nothingness becomes even more desperate
A moving mausoleum of eternal death
A delicate cut through the heart of goodness
Tyrants of an alternate faith rise in clarity
We provoke spiritual leadership
We step out of this miserable race
We become one with the fragmenting principle
We are one
we are none
Bloody knives and utopias shall be hidden
Yet there is a weapon that will never be found
We the shadow's priests
we are absence
The endless not-knot
the void's presence
Directing the anxiety circus in eternity
Monument, o great monument of time
Oh you black colossus of presence
At the heart of it all...
I will no longer rise
Nor will I fall
From towers shadowing the sky
All logic comes tumbling down
As one and one equals none
When Icarus' ways lead to Phoenix' grace
Victory I praise
Illuminated
resurrected
Come ye father and reap my soul
Come ye, come ye father
Unveil it all
Now and forever we fall
We fall!
O great father Satan, reveal thy mystery to me
I devote my existence to praise thee
Lead me on thy path to infinity
Come forth demise!
What sweet revelation do you bring?
This is the end of everything
This is the bottomless betrayal
Time flies and life passes by
Forever determined and stuck to the dirt
Thou art desire
Thou art nothing
Reflecting the illusion of light
In agony
A glimpse of passion
Manoeuvring through the twilight
Of a dying god
We must rape this pure gift of God
the evolution of man
by reaching out beyond His consecrated ground!
We must seek the entrance to Satan's time-and-space-consuming paradise, 
the anti-utopian perfection!
We must face the Eden
we must transcend logic into faith on the pathways through the event-horizon
Acknowledge holy singularities and recreate balance within a dualistic eternity!
Ye shall leave no trace
But measures and obstacles behind
A final rearrangement
Turning the lights
Once and for all
This imprisonment is for those
Divided from the true will
Are trapped by time
Enslaved puppets on a string they are
The power of the I fades
Come forth demise
What sweet revelation do you bring?
Oh mighty black ships of time
Lead these men to destination
Where their spirits will be fed
To the lowest of the demons
Flickering lights
All senses alerted
Like hot wire
Vibrating up in the skies
Electric sparks
Becoming flames
Floating like sulphur
Through the veins of the so called saints
Off from grace we fall
Oh mournful souls
A cruel but yet delightful scenario
Mother's in the tomb,
Mother's in the tomb,
Father is taking all life away
and time keeps on marching
Marching on and on!
Oh passion, oh magnificent sin
Dwells and dwells from deep within
Like an ever overflowing growth
Giving lifeless birth
Giving an impotent kind to Him
Out of the abyss
Up on earth
thy soil
Then the garden for those who can withstand
O cruel gardener lead this flock into flames
Infernal stench shall inherit the world
Oh mighty cosmos, oh great consumer
Lift your mask and reveal thy ultimate principle
NONE EQUALS NONE
Duality... 
trinity
Multiplicities... 
cycles... 
clarities...
Death
Once and forever - 
reap us all
Our comrade in nothingness
Above time, above all
We are one
Dance! dance to our song
Build formations
And deconstruct again
You're figures in this eternal play
Can you hear the sound of chain-bound hearts
Beating like a slavedrum
What immaculate bliss lies in the sovereignty of the elitist soul
Dancing in union with the neither-not
Naked and bare of all reason
We fall... 
we fall...
Woe is me if I am bound to flesh, 
the staggering will be consumed by serpents and flames
Dignified man awaken! 
Acknowledge His revelations!
Praise His manifestations or perish in flames
Channel the quintessence of Satan
Obtained are now all wisdom's thrones
Once desired, splendidly clear, envisioned through my inner-eye
Extinguished equilibrium as I became immortal
No blood but time flows through my veins
Dimensions and matter, dissolved and confound
I spit forth tongues of fire, 
no blood to soak this battleground
Ultimate knowledge is a vast plateau, 
concealed for millenniums
Unknown, unseen, yet spirit longs for nourishment, 
for eons and still
Thus I must break the cycle of life and death 
and bring an end to the greatest of all sins
Dying is the sacrilige of man-divine
A new age rises to my outstreched arms, 
an age of uprising or eternal stagnation
No more blood and no more flesh, 
all in hibernation, subconscious drama
The wisdom's flame lights the labyrinthian tunnel, 
all glass and mirror reflecting my osseous face
Bleak are the eyes that had witnessed worlds crashing into the void
Apocalypse passes by... 
apocalypse passes by... 
equilibrium pass by
Must I settle down on this throne to close my eyes?
Is this really what I am striving for? 
An infinite existence without any challenge
What is the purpose of a spirit supreme when four equals one and equilibrium never ends?
The humble disciple never seeks but finds
Just one more night is missing, the night that ends the endlessness
Sky's still alit by radiant stars until our belief's severe enough
The strings of silence hushed
The strings of silence smooth
Within a few hours all signs will read storm... listen!
Spirits roam and gather bodies, many-voiced the speechless arise
Cadavers once of proud existence, now chained to His storm
Chained to His storm!
The air approaches to condense, channelled, electric and charged
Oscillating in the circle's centre, coiling and circling and narrowing
The voices sound higher and higher, 
the light rises faster and faster
The silence is smothered by hiss, 
the sonics are piercing the bodies and thunder is shaking the ground
The elements are in uproar, 
all signs now read storm
Insignia shine dark ablaze from a violent encounter of sulphur and lead
Sparks, fire, thunder and lightning, 
furious tempests of the apocalypse
The world holds its breath, 
a moment like an eternity
An infinitely rising coil is merging with the cone
Oh, magical miraculous horn, 
stretch out into eternity
Atmosphere's resounding with claps of heavy wings
The storm of hell will never halt, 
driving angels and demons round its vortex
Perpetual magical battle for the glorious return of Him
In the ancient tradition of conjuration, 
I'm evoking my bestial urge
I raise blackened magic to the heavens, 
words like spears against the light
So, appear and bring forth what I'm yearning for
Flesh is slave to the spirit's reign, 
creatures enslaved in this spiteful act
Submissive servants to my rite
Summoning the old fire that licks and consumes
Souls victimized and presented to Him
What flame burns brighter than desire in a violent ritual rage
Sublimating the lowest human instincts
Lust, pain and passion as sinful gifts
Wildfire in the heart of man, channelled and overcome
Utilizing the flesh, elevating the spirit to grant me powers beyond nature
So let the earth open up and spew whores, 
sexual rites to praise His name
I command your tongues of fire!
Unclean flesh purify my spirit, set me ablaze on the climax of sin
A newborn day waits to surrect, but what will cover dawn?
Neither begging nor pleading will find ears when all the angel hordes have gone to war
Processions of flesh creep over the earth
Welcomed to get in line for a final twisted dance
O, what a gruesome sight, the ghastly cortege of death
Repent, bathe in fire, cleanse your souls
Writhe within the moment of emptiness, 
sinful lot await your eternal fall
Awaiting the lamb to break the seals, 
so that the seven trumpets resound
Headless hordes herald the beginning of the end
The angel of fear burns infidel men
The angel of regret whips the skin off their bones
Thus hold your breath and harken close
His darkness is final, His will grandiose
Can you feel their presence, this is judgement day
All signs are pointing to kingdom come
No sea of holy water could purify your vessels soiled
Swept from the shores of life to the sharp edges of death
Heathen plague rot away and face your destiny
We rise up from the human dust
To dwell here on earth between heaven and hell
We witness foolishness end in despair
You'll be buried under the falling stars, 
you'll be drowned in the poisoned sea
Pest crowned herd, sentenced to die, 
this final day passes with your dying breath
I witness all the falling souls consumed
Reward me father for I have sinned
Baptized by fire, servant of Thy will
I'm still wide awake
Worms come devour, feed on entrails and brain
My unclean spirit shatters all earthly bane
Restfully I'm awaiting the moment of descent
Through the soil of human filth I still hear their hearts pounding
Dislodging the burden of physique after a lifetime of seeking His manifestations
Deciphering the writings and signs
No martyr of flesh will ever receive His divine grace
No one can stretch against the heavens while rooting deep in the ground
To pass the gate one must leave contrasts, views, poles and sound
Only the haethen rots within the cage of a horizon
Opening doors of mortality will only build walls
Murder all doubts, break the chains that bind
Blessed are the seeing, damned are the blind
Worlds of the antithesis move towards me
The supreme command defies flesh and blood
Smother all infidel men, hallowed be Thy name
Bow down, confess and acknowledge
And I witness all the falling souls consumed
The shadow of mortality slays the illusions of infinity
When a heart burns with passion the intellect yields faith
The flaming star of salvation shines upon man
While God's creation gazes at the horizon of death
Views of endless oceans of bones attract the eye
Paralyzed is the soul by such divine revelations
Chants of tranquility obscure the heathen's mind, 
join in the choir of the damned
We demand a new order of chaos within the universe and raise pandemonium on earth
Our blood for Satan, their tears for God
Our blood for Satan, their tears for God
And the vacuum of souls yawns inbetween
Those who never confessed roam the limbus forever
Feed their pain to the demons and their hope to the angels
From the ashes, from the fiery pits of Hell, 
Satan's legions rise again
Subtle shifts the day to night, 
slowly fade doctrines of light
Without the roaring of a final battle, 
without the colossal act of disgrace
With every sin and every lie, 
you could watch the monuments of darkness rise
The last moment bears the revelation, 
the cruel and ruling all-consuming unity
Through the halls of the enigma, 
built on giant bloodstained pillars
Resplendent seem these silver walls, 
silent phantoms I haunt
Towards the emptiness, 
towards the gorge
Towards the emptiness, 
towards the gorge
Onwards, onwards to Hell
I am the cloud through which the angels fell
Onwards, onwards to Hell
I am torture, death and fatal spell
Onwards through a purgatory of colours
To hell into the devouring darkness
Onwards opaque visions I pursue
To hell impervious delusive lights
Quest, creed, humility
Swordstrokes of ignorence block the path to Him
Doubt, regret, disbelief
Ye wavering forms draw near so I smite you again
I am on my way to infinity, 
I am drowning in sway and I'm nothing
My transition is pure yet unclean,
everything I am is in Him
My path is omnidirectional since He unveiled my soul
I ripped off my fleshly shell, 
roused is the demon, spirit unclean
Thrones and dominions mean nothing to me as long as I seek the truth
Thus I break man, 
stone and ice on my journey towards beyond
Dignified man awaken! Acknowledge His revelations!
Praise His manifestations or perish in flames!
Channelling the quintessence of Satan
Empty the vessel and hollow the shell
Come, toungues of fire
Abandon all earthly, glance deep into hell
Purge and inspire
The act of worship sets us ablaze
Demonic burden, ecstatic delight
A monument of malicious sonority
Our humble sacrifice, devotional rite
Revealed in the flesh
Justified in the spirit
Seen by the chosen
Heard by the few
All earthly vanities of existence
Exceeded by tones supreme
Melodies older than mortality
Enormous as death itself
Praise his name
Chosen are the ones
Who have command of the language
That needs neither mouth nor words
Who transform the inmost truth to notes
Who form sculptures reflecting his glory
And spread the gospel of the horned
We’ve been granted the most precious gift
We are element and entirety
Performing the everlasting cycle
Without beginning or end
Find the unimaginable paradise
Amidst these pits of hell
Those who chant his hymns
Hallowed be their names
Immortal is the choir
Only the highest art
Supreme and impure
Purified through his will
Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of him
Souls of infidel men
Form a fertile soil
Like dusky forest grow
On rotten leaves below
Souls of infidel men
Wither and burn
Like arid grass on dead ground
Forsaken, eternally bound
We feed on the essence of mortal weakness
The flames chain the fallen and proud
Holyness, purity, and all gifts of light
Long vanished, decayed and dead
Buried by god’s children eons ago
Heathens, sordid and profane
We are the legion, the leveling horde
True to the laws of the horned
Faithful and strengthened and
Fiercely unbound
Lurking to gather the mourned
Planted is the seed of him
And no blood flows in our veins
Nurtured by souls of infidel men
In the kingdom where darkness
Forever reigns
Soil of souls
Behold and see
Glorious our realm will be
Filled with humbleness and tempted by pride I kneel before you
I did not command but accept the fires you send
For not my hands receive and give, but through yours I deliver
Incomplete yet not unjust, and with you I shall burn
Come and fill my vessel!
Grant me the right to speak
Clothe me with the fabric of perception
Here I am, bare and bleeding, facing your vast magnificence
Come and fill my vessel!
Am I worthy, is my dignity enow
Your Spears shall pierce my nescience
Who is higher than me, who else has your authority
Is my arrogance the sole ordeal in front of you?
Do these rites legitimate me to evangelise
Will you guide me through the entrails of the Earth
And accept my sacrifice
In the dirt, in orans posture
Presenting the litany
What more is there to offer than myself
My deeds and thoughts, my anguish and joice
Indulging in the shadow of your splendour
Building Cathedrals not of stones but words and tones
Bind not these hands of yours, but anoint them with strength
Fill this ardent vessel with your fiery revelation
Through one single man sin came upon earth
One single man is enough to open up eternity
So take this yoke of him and bear
Take the order and sacrifice this new covenant
Holy oil, Candles and blood
Drink from this chalice
Taste from the most forbidden fruit
Flesh opens the membership
In the mystic body of him
Become the tempter!
May the painful burden of these sacred words
Become holy privilege
And meaningful purpose of existence
May the sole gesture of you once scorned vessels
Become fiery reality
Feast on the body and become the impure!
Ye the almighty, unto whom all hearts are open
All desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid
Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts
By the inspiration of thy flames
We worthily magnify thy thousand names all unified in thou
Abyssic lord, we call, plead and crave!
Send your legions
Come forth, angels of sin
One of the seven will come
And with the golden censer step up to the altar
Carrying incense and embers to be burnt before the throne
To bring our words to him
And from the hands of the winged sovereignty
Overcome with humbleeness facing such grandeur
I am blazing with awe and shine with the fires of him
I kneel down, brace posture and offer my gifts
I lay outstretched in five pointed symmetry
I purge the ground and close the gate
Call back your legions
Descend, angels of sin
Grant me command
Let me burn with strength
Sharpen my sense and my will
Lucifer! Rebellious son, infernal one!
Tempt me! Lead and ignite me!
No longer shall we be called servants
We testify and cast off these chains
Hesitation, sloth, incertitude
No longer shall we fall prey to these soothing whores
So let me rise
Thorns pierce and nails purge
Struck with awe we shall ascend these high ranks
And shall be vigilant to the blasphemies of the divine
The devil's wisdom is commended to the untiring
Who persistently perform exercises clandestine
Prudent are we as we celebrate the mysteries
Transform all abominations, free the body of all desires
Our lession shall be sacred medicine
Sermonizing we rejoice in the house of temptations
Freedom is no longer an illusionary whore
Celebrate his name, ye souls, waken
From your determined slumber of eons
We chain ourselves and serve with pride
We wallow in this earthly dirt
Our free will is perception
Our prayer is our fate
The first duty of the earthborn is worship
As it directs the soul towards him
Because it is him man is bound to as mystic source and purpose
Protean king of thousand faces and forms
Only when man accepts his highest reign and truth by revelation
Then man is above all welk and rotten
So I proclaim the glory of our lord
To the devil, the father of all
We praise thee
To Satan, his mysteries hidden within all scripts and cults
We praise thee
To Lucifer, who touched man and brought knowledge on earth
We praise thee
To him, who is above us, in us, as well as below
We praise thee
We praise thee by our existence!
Glory
Oh, rebellious son
Glory
Blackwinged angel, fallen one
To the devil, the father of all
When man's entire conduct is catered to him
When man's worship is exercised with surrender
Then man's soul is directed towards him
Then man is above all welk and rotten
Not in humility we look down
But resolute we stare into the abyss
For the righteous falls 7 times a day
And depravity paves the way into damnation
Rejoice! Powers of hell
Shadow legions, darkness descendants
Exult and gather all around Satan's throne
Lucifer, our lord is risen
Enthroned upon deniers bones
Thus sound the trumpets of doom
Rejoice!
Rejoice, oh earth in sunken splendour
Vanished in the brightness of your king
Satan has conquered, once and for all
For he has redeemed us with his infinite fall
Inverted Eden and bled for Adam's sin
Mad laughter and disharmony
Resound, ye songs, in ecstasy
Chant well his gospel, cry aloud, inflame the fires of hell
Scorched be feathers, flesh and skin
All Choirs and armies nw join in
Exult and rejoice to the honour of him
And so we sin
And so we sin, fall and rise herein this dirt
Born out of dust, but fire we became
To the great dragon we have served all the hearts impaled
On crimson pillars pointing to Megiddo
Assuaging his hunger, quenching his thirst
With the endless stygian stream
Made of all blood and all tears of all angels and saints
We cut the flesh open and proclaim the rise of us through him
Martyrs of the earth
We praise your strength of transformation
Martyrs of the heavens
We bath in your feces and blood
And summon the
Martyrs of hell
Sing to the honour of him
Pyrophorous titan, fiery ghost
Caller out of the netherworld onto earth's armies of Lazari
Winged spirit baptist, unveil the layers of haze
Speak the word only
And awaken your zealous advocaltes of the inferno
Those sunken into dreams
Where seconds become a thousand years
We are torn between orgies and wars
As long as poles do not unite
As long as angels fall and devil's bleed man will weep
Tempt me not! 
Sordid soul deceivers
Tempt me not! 
Or watch your World be consumed by fire
I receive this flaming vesture from his hands
A Purple rode, green his signs, gold the sigils
And fufill my ceremonial duty
He is powerful to heighten my grace
He lives and rules as king from eternity to eternity
Where did all struggle lead the slaves
Whom helped all knowledge, who escaped
The grip of God, the scythe of Death
Doubt is the gyve of the weak, belief the sword of the free
So we worship thee!
Winged revolutionary
Fiery emissary
Wrathful luminary
All earthborn plod perpetually to rise and praise aloud
We're martyrs blessed with infancy, neglect is our shroud
Continuallly lasts this act to build your Majesty
All earth does worship thee!
Lucifer, enlighten not
this world's not worth to shed your image on
but blind them all who are gazing into your light
tarnish the servants and seekers alike
neither Eden nor Inferno is their house
extinguish your flame they're all unworthy of
bring forth the night, spit poison, spread blight
kill friend and foe, disbeliever, proselyte
all hail darkness and evil
eternally trapped in the purgatory aether
damned to rot between heaven and hell
all hail damnation and terror
ungranted redemption, cursed by the serpent's spell
cast out, entrance forbidden
the moonchild is strangled, a new cycle yields
nothing but suffering while gallows dance
on the endless cemetery fields
and the harlot has taken up the sword of silence
to spill the blood of the saints
their semen mingled in her sinful cup of worms
the seed unholy and unclean
and Salome points the sword of silence
to dance the seven muting veils towards John
sacred betrayal, spell doom to all men
and the seed spread forth unholy and unclean
knowledge is not wisdom
be silent!
darkness reigns and murders all light
be still!
choked and strangled by the serpent you seek
I laugh as you bleed
knowledge is not wisdom
be still!
smash and wreck your sanctuary
pissing on your holiest mystery
I cut the knot of Gordia
and lead the sword of queen Discordia
bending Kether to Matkuth
while separating all and not
letting you survive under the ruins of your temple
contemplation and retreat is regress
once the abyss is crossed
the severity of the devil's verities
ends all eternally
where Samael lurks in rebellious defiance
to cut the branches off with the sword of silence
in this glorious age
of darkness and death
of witchcraft andfire
foul stench rises up from the depths
he hears our chanting
we obey his call
Lord Satan's arrival
the abyss takes its toll
the plague of rats is welcomed
the pestilence is spread
Lord Satan's arrival
silent beast, ghoul of worms, king of the dead
woeful is the sight on those who walk
in rotten trance
bodies twist like branches deformed
he commands and executes, grotesque the dance
and mute, not one sound breaks the eternal night
all bones, rotten flesh, scythe in hand
he appears as the winged reaper, horned dancer
lifting his instrument, darting his pestilent tongue
and the golden angel of salvation is burning
by the moon's haze and autumnal light
yet seasons freeze and crack under the burden of time
upon the earth to roam
to unveil that which never was and never
to become
eerie and cold
winds that blow foul and old
fights unknown to a sun
morbid, spectral, unreal
from the deep maw of infinity
his breath spawns terror for all eternity
for every new aeon arising he exhales
the poisonous pant of damnation
the cold breath of Satan
all graves are flung wide open
legions follow the bleak tyrant
he calls his army with merciless shrieks
oaths once sworn, now to be renewed
unforgiving is the vortex of hell
faustian pacts turn to fatal spells
he breathes out the
eternal winter of blood, tears and pain
repeating shapes, sigils morph into biting blades
formless icons each contains
nucleus of Satan's ghastly breath
not from the heavens high he fell
but from the deepest abyss he rose
within us and without us
he, older than all other gods
whose names no stone ever mentions
who left the faintest trace in the memory of man
so is he, the lord of evil, mighty and ever here
what you call hidden is only hidden to you
I know hence I am, a secret unlocked, holy his law
iron will, firm belief, all is spread out before me
none before him
the truth like a savage beast set free
victorious is his army, burnt earth we walk upon
vicious is his iron arm
underneath he crushes the unbeliever
wytches and daemons obey him
all dance under his command
none before him - titans, temples and time
all left for the sand
the grim and stygian shape of the opposer
he rises in the sombre sadness
in the silence of monastic madness
behind monolithic pillars
of churches, shrines and chapels
in the dust of age-old cathedrals
where the horrors of death shake the ground
his shadow grows in arcane castles
where secret sins gnaw the souls of gauntly lords
in the crypts where alchemysts transform
the nature of things
in the woods where magicians practice
their nocturnal arts
Satan is everywhere
many can see him, to many he speaks
hermits call him and we serve him
when fiery omens set the night ablaze
when stars take strange shapes
and planets bathe in blood
when we spread the seed of malediction
carried through the absolute all-abyss
unforgiving is the infinity of darkness
his breath of flames surrounds and occupies all
all motion freezes to moving stasis of lava matter
fire without end
end of time, time for the end
slit throats cut veins rape souls eat hearts
plunge humanity into the pits of eternity
blood lakes black holes deep chasms
all dimensions crumble
when mirrors crack
sinister energy permeates
reality melts into lentous states
pouring over from the astral world
the flaming void consumes
death spawns changes, senses overstrain
the omniverse dissolves, evil reigns supreme
Satan wields his axe
all imploding chaos arises
I have tempted him, fed doubt to his heart
stirred up the old people with anger and zeal
sharpened the spear for his suffering
mixed gall and vinegar for him to drink
prepared the cross to crucify him
and the nails to pierce hands and feet
open the brass gates of cruelty
prepare his descent into hell
thousand breathing crosses
consumed is Jerusalem
open graves, empty tombs
sore scars become incurable wounds
mysteries of sin
weave the burial shroud of Golgotha
sacred flesh, bones and skin
rotten reeks Utopia
sinking into unholy ground, below
in tears and blood they're drowned
prophet's horns of doom resound
born is the Antichrist
the earth-corpse will be sacrificed
now let the dreadful drama of the Apocalypse
commence!
the dead arise, the underworld echoes with thunder
damned souls, demonic army, rise, sons of darkness
behold the signs of un-salvation
monuments of the saviour's absence
An old cloud like a notion of times gone by
the scent of death and decay
preserved
in the past's perpetual haze
all trees sing rotten hymns
the soil is lifeless where evil dwells
let the eternal night encompass any light
when shadows mingle with the vapours of the earth
when thoughts become manifest and deeds dissolve
Azazel roars the tragedies of man
the devil raises chaos against the holy plan
Satan whispers primordial lies
Pandora spawns the Lord of flies
Belial thrusts to the sun's demise
from the depths a fog will rise
misty spirits, cursed ghosts, all that never dies
forms the ancient fog of evil
Come near, fiery eruptions
Inhaling abysmal emanations
All knowing unfolding before me
The magic of excess
overwhelming
The noose that lightens my liberty
Within boundaries once constrained
Yet savagely and fierce I thrust
Towards the depths glimpse
Despair and fear are shed in anger
I beat wings of victory
Satiety no tame or temper
Wild spirits, reckless
Fullness tempts me
And the behead of ecstasy
The devil's joyful mysteries
Luring madness waits for me
I give my soul and reap it all
The fires of damnation are calling
The evil eye burns in malign
Behold the eerie constellation
Eclipse all hearts at my coronation
Untamed devastation follows the dark age and invocation
I am I, I am all, I am Satan's arm
















1. The Wilderness

It was when I realized
that life has no meaning
no purpose, no quarry
...no answeres...

And all the dreary night
that had befallen across
the land
I slipped into a revery
a web of human hand

You longed to soar up high
to caress the silky winds
to embrace and kiss as lovers
...the ether...

but fate with cursed hand
has struck wretch apon your head
this wretch has been the day
you were born (human)

I live my life alone
and all it's misery
until the day I turn to stone
I shall die alone
among the wilderness

It was when I realized
apon my waking eyes
no nightmare of mankind
can harm me...

I live my life alone
among the wilderness
until the day i turn to stone
Life is but a dream
among the wilderness

...I spread my golden wings
set sail my weightless form
and soar into the cosmos
...Forevermore...


2. As Embers Dress The Sky

The shallow voice of the wind
cries between these ebony wings
The shallow cries of the win
sing a swansong for mankind

Shine on morning skyfire
ablaze this final day
The autumnal end, the dawn of man
The centuries fade below my feet

I soared above them
as they worthlessly poured
thought from a chalice
as wisdom would flow,
twilight would come to pass
drink oh hallowed cup of life

Shine on evening skyfire
paint the sky with the blood of a raven
bereavement, oh garment of ebony
as embers dress the dusk of man...


3. Foliorum Viridum

4. This Old Cabin

...Blood on my hands...

I walked in the shadows
'neth an azure midnight sky
I walked in the shadows
to abscond a life not my own
I walked in the night
this life I hate

Destroy this life, this life I hate
return me to the womb
thy crystalline will
has finally shattered
As spring rain paints itself
on the canvas of youth
it's snowing still in my heart

Will I ride the summer winds
or dance apon the crimson horizon
will I find paradise in hell?
If I go deep into the woods
If I go to this cabin

As scarlet flowers lust for the dew of morning
and infants nurse on the nectar of motherhood
As prophets of ruin wield their swords of wisdom
and battle forth towards a brighter dawn

Take me away from here
...Falling...
...Soaring...

If I go deep into the woods
If I go to this cabin
If I go deep into the woods
If I go will you follow?

...Falling...
...Soaring...
Take me away from here

This blood on my hands
to celebrate my passing
My soul shall bleed
for eternity
...in silence...

1. She Painted Fire Across The Skyline

Oh dismal mourning...
I open my weary eyes once again
My life has been left hollow and ashes have filled the gorge of my within
Last night I hoped and wished I'd die in my sleep but no catharsis was granted to
me
Will this pain ever pass?
The enchanting perfume of winter and the bleak, cold breath of her still haunts
me...
Oportet ubique pulchritudinem evanescere

So half of me rode to the mountains and the other half soared high in the winds
to a place where the angels had fallen, the soil gagged and choked on their wings
My soul was the pale skyline that she stretched across the horizon
Two years had brought the fire that she paints upon my loathsome canvas

She is the dark one...
As a bird I watched her from my cold tower in the heavens
and when she fell from the northplace, I flew down and embraced her
I took her where the snow falls forever, she showed me the haunted woods
We gathered together in the oaken palace, free from both death and life
The fire blazed in her eyes one day and she tore the soul from my chest
With a bleeding heart, I flew back to my cold tower
to never escape and lie in a pool of death forever

I saw the nightfall...
It called to me like a river of shadows
It sang to me with the cries of a thousand ravens that blackened the sky as they
took flight
and sank the Sol
I shall never trust the sun again, Eridanis Nadir

I ran away far into the woods
To find the Sol, I called to her...
I don't want to be forgotten...I never wanted to be human
Never!

So alas the sun had descended, her fire burned brilliant in the sky
The trees bore their withered silhouettes, that cast a spell upon unearthly white
No wolf shall keep his secrets, no bird shall dance the skyline
And I am left with nothing but an oath that gleams like a sword
To bathe in the blood of man
Mankind...


2. The Mishapen Steed


3. Hallways Of Enchanted Ebony

Kiss me coldly and drain this life from my lips
Let the cold blood flow on it's own...
Kiss me coldly and fall away from the soul
Long forgotten...

From which of this oak shall I hang myself?
These ebon halls are always dark...
From which frostbitten bough shall I die?

As dark as the winter, as black as her ghastly veil
As cold as her whisper and chilling gown

No corridors of life and beauty
These enchanted halls are stained with the blood of night
Ebon halls gleam as ghosts of a fire dance wickedly across a pantheon of marble

These weary eyes shall open no more, frozen tightly by the cold embrace of death
A charnel house of memories torn and burning melancholy shall embrace me now

Hear this call...
Beyond endless halls and far across the vast forest, just across the iron gates
Whispers...

As dark as the winter, as black as her grim mask of death
As cold as her sorrow, her ivory tears

No corridors of life and beauty
No bloodred sky, no colors left in this world

It was the light's end


4. Dead Winter Days

There lies a beauty behind forbidden wooden doors
A beauty so rare and pure, it would make human eyes bleed and burn...

...She killed herself in the fall...

I am the unmaker, I bring death to the beautiful dawn
With pillor, cold, and a legion of dying angels...

...I killed myself in the spring...

A grim bough had hung me high
I sank the fires of the Sol
Here, nightfall reigns

I oppose the light
I gather the storms
with a sword I wield with hate
I shot down the sun with bow and flame
Pillorian for the dead winter

I am the unmaker
The pillorian...the ending
I...die...
I damn you the dead winters...


5. As Embers Dress The Sky

The shallow voice of the wind cries between these ebony wings
The shallow cries of the wind sing a swansong for mankind

Shine on morning skyfire
ablaze this final day
The autumnal end, the dawn of man
The centuries fade below my feet

I soared above them as they worthlessly poured thought from a chalice
As wisdom would flow, twilight would come to pass
Drink, oh hallowed cup of life

Shine on evening skyfire
Paint the sky with the blood of a raven
Bereavement, oh garment of ebony
As embers dress the dusk of man...


6. The Melancholy Spirit

It was in this haunted place under a moonless cloak of ebony
I was drawn to the glow of a young spiritess weeping in the woods

The blackest ravens and ice-veiled boughs
Have spoken of you, goddess of these bleak woods
I yearn for your embrace, spiritess of the melancholia
Show me, again, your sweet face
Enchant me with your rich, cinder burnt ether
Lure me into your arms and bless unto me eternal death

She had spoken to the dawn
Her words wisped in tongues of the wind

And then silence...
Pale clouds betrothed the dawn
Black rain fell
The birds wore masks

The haunting stain of her woe
Had burned itself into the oak
Night had gone
Bereaved, I was torn for her

One last time I witnessed her beauty in the distance
The arms of the trees tore at her morbid gown swaying in the loathsome winter
breeze
She faded before my eyes
Since that day a thousand veiled birds have taken flight
And the melancholy rain still pours forever on...

1. Of Stone, Wind And Pillor

...It was not long ago when I had fallen from this mortal world,
Lost in dream flight to pierce the horizon as a bird...

Is this life the pillor I must bear?
To grow in this wretched world?
...With hate each day I burn...
The birds above, they ride the winds
And from each piercing talon dangles a soul

The stone awaits my fall
Upon a grave I dug myself
The birds sing their requiems
Please lend me your wisdom to fly above the heavens,
Across seas of gold, to my land of frostbitten, ageless night

Let me dig my own grave
Let me, oh precious noose of mine
You are my mother, whose womb around my neck
Grants me a world of cold nihility
An endless winter night
A bitter, black frozen hell
For me
Forever!

Is this the pillor I must bear?
To die on this fucking world?
...With hate I die and burn...
The birds above, they caress the winds
They lend me the wisdom to fly...


3. Haunting Birds


4. Kneel To The Cross

Give us our bread and bury our dead
And kneel to the cross on the wall
Whether burnt at the stake or drunk at the wake
Just kneel to the cross on the wall
We've original sin, but we might just get in
If we beg to the cross on the wall
It's love your neighbour and rattle your sabre
But kneel to that cross on the wall.

See the roof fall, hear the bells crash
As flesh and bone turns to ash
Tried to conquer the sun with a Christian frost
The corpses' stench beneath the cross

And give them gold and they'll save your soul
And kneel to the cross on the wall
And hail to the boss of the great unwashed
And kneel to the cross on the wall
They wail and weep, the march of the sheep
As they go to the cross on the wall
And it's ever so wrong to dare to be strong
So kneel to the cross on the wall

See the roof fall, hear the bells crash
As flesh and bone turns to ash
Tried to conquer the sun, with a Christian frost
The corpses' stench beneath the cross.
And it's ever so wrong to dare, to be strong
And it's ever so wrong to dare, to be strong
But summer is a-coming and arise! Arise!
But summer is a-coming and arise! Arise!


5. A Poem By Yeats

The brawling of a sparrow in the eaves,
The brilliant moon and all the milky sky,
And all that famous harmony of leaves,
Had blotted out man's image and his cry.

A girl arose that had red mournful lips
And seemed the greatness of the world in tears,
Doomed like Odysseus and the labouring ships
And proud as Priam murdered with his peers;

Arose, and on the instant clamorous eaves,
A climbing moon upon an empty sky,
And all that lamentation of the leaves,
Could but compose man's image and his cry.

1. A Celebration For The Death Of Man...


2. In The Shadow Of Our Pale Companion

Through vast valleys I wonder
To the highest peaks
On pathways through a wild forgotten landscape
In search of God, in spite of man
'til the lost forsaken endless...
This is where I choose to tread

Fall... so shall we fall into the nihil?
The nothingness that we feel in the arms of the pale
In the shadow of the grim companion who walks with us

Here is the landscape
Here is the sun
Here in the balance of the earth
Where is the god?
Has he fallen and abandoned us?

As I'm stalked by the shadow of death's hand
The fire in my heart is forged across the land

Here at the edge of this world
Here I gaze at a pantheon of oak, a citadel of stone
If this grand panorama before me is what you call God...
Then God is not dead

I walked down to a river and sat in reflection of what had to be done
An offering of crimson flowed into the water below
A wound of spirit from which it floated and faded away

...like every hope I've ever had...
...like every dream I've ever known...
It washed away in a tide of longing, a longing for a better world
From my will, my throat, to the river, and into the sea...
...wash away...
...fade away...

Here is the landscape
Here is the sun
Here at the edge of the earth
Where is the god?
Has he fallen to ruin?

As I'm stalked by the shadow of death's hand
My heathen pride is scarred across the land


3. Odal

4. I Am The Wooden Doors

When all is withered and torn
And all has perished and fallen
These great wooden doors shall remain closed...

When the heart is a grave filled with blood
And the soul is a cold and haunted shall of lost hope
When the voice of pride has been silenced
And dignity's fires are but cinders
...their grandeur shall remain untainted

It is this grandeur that protects the spirit within
From the plight of this broken world, from the wounds in her song
I wish to die with my will and spirit intact
The will that inspired me to write these words
Seek not the fallen to unlock these wooden doors


5. The Lodge

6. You Were But A Ghost In My Arms

Like snowfall, you cry a silent storm
Your tears paint rivers on this oaken wall...
Amber nectar, misery ichor
. . .cascading in streams of hallowed form
For each stain, a forsaken shadow

You are the lugubrious spirit
Etched in the oak of wonder
You are the sullen voice and silent storm

Each night I lay
Awakened by her shivering silent voice
From the shapes in the corridor walls.
It pierces the solitude like that of a distant scream
In the pitch-black forest of my delusion...

With each passing day, a deeper grave...

Why did you leave me to die?
Why did you abandon me?
Why did you walk away and leave me bitterly yearning?

Her haunting, contorted despair was etched into the wood's grain
Though fire rages within me, no fire burns fiercer than her desire
The shape whispers my name...

I damn this oak!
I damn her sorrow!
I damn these oaken corridors
That bear the ghosts of those I've thrown away!

Though tempted I am to caress her texture divine
And taste her pain sweet, sweet like brandy wine;
I must burn these halls, these corridors
And silence her shrill, tormenting voice
...forever...

Like snowfall, you cried a silent storm
No tears stain this dust in my hands
But from this ashen gray, her voice still
Whispers my name...

You were the lugubrious spirit
Who haunted the oak of wonder
You were the geist that warned this frozen silent storm
You were but a ghost in my arms


8. ...And The Great Cold Death Of The Earth

Life is a clay urn on the mantle
And I am shattered on the floor
Life is a clay urn on the mantle
And I am scattered on the floor
We are the wounds and the great cold death of the earth...

Earth is floating on the waters like an island,
Hanging from four rawhide ropes
Fastened at the top of the Sacred four directions.
The ropes are tied to the ceiling of the sky,
When the ropes break, this world will come
Tumbling down and all living things will fall with it and die...

Life is a clay urn on the mantle
And I am the fragments on the floor
Life is a clay urn on the mantle
And I am the ashes on the floor
We are the wounds and the great cold death of the earth
Darkness and silence, the light shall flicker out...


9. A Desolation Song

Here I sit at the fire
Liquor's bitter flames warm my languid soul
Here I drink alone and remember
A graven life, the stain of her memory
In this cup, love's poison
For love is the poison of life
Tip the cup, feed the fire,
And forget about useless fucking hope...

Lost in the desolation of love
The passions we reap and sow
Lost in the desolation of life
This path that we walk...

Here's to love, the sickness
The great martyr of the soul
Here's to life, the vice
The great herald of misery
In this cup, spiritus frumenti
For this is the nectar of the spirit
Quench the thirst, drown the sorrow
And forget about cold yesterdays...

Lost in the desolation of love
The passions we reap and sow
Lost in the desolation of life
This path that we walk...
Lost in the desolation of love
The sorrows we reap and sow
Lost in the desolation of life
The path that we walk...

1. Limbs

The texture of the soul is a liquid that casts a vermilion flood
From a wound carved as an oath it fills the river bank a sanguine fog

These arms were meant to be lost
Hacked, severed and forgotten

The texture of time is a whisper that echoes across the flood
It's hymn resonates from tree to tree, through every sullen bough it sings

These boughs were said to be lost
Torn, unearthed and broken

Earth to flesh, flesh to wood
Cast these limbs into the water
Flesh to wood, wood to stone
Cast this stone into the water


2. Falling Snow

The water pours its embracing arms 'round the stone
Decay drips from the unquiet void
Where the ice forms, where life ends
The stone is by the crimson flood, swallowed
The red tide beyond the ebon wound, contorted
My sacrifice bids farewell in this river of memory
A wave to end all time

Red birds escape from my wounds and return as falling snow
To sweep the landscape; a wind haunted, wings without bodies
The snow, the bitter snowfall
You long to die in her pale arms, crystalline
To become an ode to silence
In the soul of a mountain of birds, fallen
The cascading pallor of ghostless feather
The snow has fallen and raised this white mountain on which you will die and fade away in silence


3. This White Mountain On Which You Will Die

4. Fire Above, Ice Below

The woeful silence; wind's reflection
Of your body's pale, icy fortress
...of blood and ages

Sky fire above, ice below the hearth
Sky fire above, ice below the hearth

Fall away from me
To that citadel at the end of time
Where death sleeps
And dreams of your buried pain

There has never been a silence like this before
There will never be an ode like this again


5. Not Unlike The Waves

Aurora swims in the ether
Emerald fire scars the night sky
Solstafir

Amber streams from Sol
Are not unlike the waves
Of the sea nor the endless horizon of ice
Solstafir

Aurora swims in the ether
Emerald fire paints the twilight
Heidrun bleeds the golden nectar
For the rising sun and the moon
The midnight wolves who watch over the dawn
A golden dawn

Solstafir


7. Our Fortress Is Burning

The god of man is a failure
Our fortress is burning against the grain of the shattered sky
Charred birds escape from the ruins and return as cascading blood
Dying bloodbirds pooling, feeding the flood
The god of man is a failure
And all of our shadows
All of our shadows
All of our shadows
Are ashes against the grain

5. Birch White

The birch tree in winter
Leaning over the secret pool
Is Narcissus in love
With the slight white branches.

The slim trunk,
In the dark glass;
But,
Spring coming on,
Is afraid,
And scarfs the white limbs
In green.

The slim trunk,
In the dark glass;
But,
Spring coming on,
Is afraid,
And scarfs the white limbs.

The birch tree in winter
Spring coming on,
Is afraid,
And scarfs the white limbs
In green.

The birch tree in winter
Leaning over the secret pool
Is Narcissus in love
With the slight white branches.

The birch tree in winter
Spring coming on,
Is afraid,
And scarfs the white limbs
In green.

1. They Escaped The Weight Of Darkness


2. Into The Painted Grey

The jagged lines in these wooden hands
speak of a silent aeon below the depths
of an austere ebon tide
for centuries kingdoms have risen
upon the ancient hands of a god
once severed for the world's birth
a sacrifice to the storms of life
now darkness is thine sanctum

Temples of magma steam across the grey
The arc that transcends my iconic pride
For I am not an ageless god, no, I am imprisoned by time
These ancient palms shall once again be mine

Hands...hands that lift the oceans
to vertical depths above the stars
For when I die, the universe will die with me
and all will be lost forever gone

Where am I?
How long shall I suffer here?
Forlorn in the cold neolithic embrace
Forsaken deep in the sullen tide
How long shall I suffer here?

Perched on the cliffside gazing out into the brine
My archaic beard pours downward and joins the feral sea
I am the heritage; the quintessence of myth and legend
The archetype of Pagan might and divinity

Hands...hands that lift the oceans
to vertical depths beyond the stars
I gather a celestial blanket around these tired bones
and finally slumber in the clouds of ice
These are my hands...
...so it is done


3. The Watcher's Monolith

Blue textures cascade downward to the base of the monolith
Like brush strokes on a canvas of souls
Two arms reach out a cloak of silent nihil
Revenants untouched by the scythe
They are lost in the dark woods of time

Aloft in the landscape that you hail
I am the fog that seeps over here in the early hours

Standing proud in the hollow of the land
A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit against the sky

The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty
and could see the ages growing from within the palms
I can feel the era slipping into oblivion,
no longer grasping the textures
I am slowly becoming stone

As wolves celebrate the dusk,
an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale

Shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows
The woodlands burn with grace
Their silence drowns the age

As wandering ghosts pass through the flames
A new age of rebirth lights the dawn

But who are they who pass by the window?
The shapes; like black solar wheels scorched in the snow
by gods of the stone...
This elder stone shall never fall!

Cast the aeons into the void
So that no other can seek them
No age, no hands shall taint them
Pour the sorrows into the sun
They are lost forever in dark woods of time
Carve the symbols into the stone
So that another can find them
No age, no hands shall change them
Pour the ages into the sun
They are lost forever in the dark woods of time


4. Black Lake

Written in the waters...

"Our shadows seep into the dusk
like cranes that melt into the pool;
a black lake in which they descend
pale ghosts caress the Nidstång in the dark
its face scarred by the ages,
its curse sent with heathen breath
to poison the waters of the black lake
We are...we are the faces below the ripples
A deep sorrow travelled through the woods
And found a home in our humble grave"

I've sent this peril...
To the world; this peril shall spread all sorrows
And you are but gods
watching from below at the base of the totem
in the black temple of the Earth
I am...I am the silence inside the tomb
You created the stars
and gave birth to all the heavens;
the darkness of space and time
So go...go to the nightside end below

Where have all the noble cranes gone?
Where have all the stags disappeared to?
Piled below in the tomb of this burdened pool
a curse to those who corrupt these sacred woods
a curse to those who taste this solemn water

No unhallowed breath shall seal a fate before me
Join the drowned in the silence of the black lake's womb
Accursed...written in the waters...


5. Ghosts Of The Midwinter Fires

There are ghosts in every hallway
In every room, behind every door
Peering through every window into the past
Holding onto us in the bitterness of the mire
Leaving a trace of themselves in the spaces in which they hide

...but there are no ghosts here...

There are gods in the wake of every flame
The fire that betroths the coldness of the void
In every wind, every tempest, and every snowfall
In every silence
Inside every root that reaches deep into the soul of the Earth

...but there are no gods here...

Shadows paint the dusk
Ghosts rise from the flames
To set alight in the fields
In robes of smoke and spirit aligned


6. To Drown

They escaped the weight of darkness
to forge a path into the marrow of the spirit
They chose to drown in a deeper vacancy
an emptiness that quells the null
a pool for the forgotten

They escaped the weight of darkness
to drown in another...


1. Birth And Death Of The Pillars Of Creation

Towers...
Deity forged architecture
Swirling in and out of form
Enveloped in the arms of dark matter
Towers...mercurial and flowing...

My work is done

Pillars...
From an antediluvian bane
Collapsing in and out of form
Embodied in a cradle of absence
Pillars...mercurial and flowing...

My work is done

By way of light acros s a vast millennia
I can behold this grandeur at its infancy
Though I know it has already passed away a millennia before

My work has begun...


3. The Astral Dialogue

The firmament above the horizon of history
Heathen fires burn the ancestral night
Esoteric figures move across the
Arcane plateau with their
Symbols engraved in the sky

The astral plane and the lineage of the past
Reborn!
An abstract interwoven archive

Languages of the gods, spoken in sidereal tongue
Divinities of the stars
Illuminate in runes of man

At the creation's hollow, a sudden white light gleams
Like a wayward sentient spirit in the mire
Of space and time
Gods sire and propagate here
Under divine law of the opus magnum
Evolution of a language to come


4. Dark Matter Gods

Cast away in solitude between the divide of dimensions
Frozen in timeless aura, a catalyst of colors
The abyss...
I was born in the fibers of oblivion; the saturnine keeper of mystery
and malevolent patriarch of chaos

...they fade into the shadows I cast... evermore in sorrow

Darkness! Chaos! A malediction! An abomination!!

...they fade into the silence I keep...

Dark Matter Gods
The abyss is the elder of time
Dark Matter Gods
The void is the archetype of being

For each step; nihility, a paradox, an epoch, a quantum crevasse...
Worlds are lost in my path

...t hey fade into footsteps I leave...

Dark Matter Gods
The dark mass is the father of all


5. Celestial Effigy

Teach me your mood, O patient stars!
Who climb each night the ancient sky,
Leaving on space no shade, no scars,
No trace of age, no fear to die.

My allegiance is with the inner self
The dark celestial voice of wisdom
Beyond the dust that is this world.

There is a voice adrift in the starless
and marble black dark space
A voice of wisdom and purity
Beyond the vestiges of sanity
There is a voice deep in the darkest places
calling...haunting me...
Where no light bears a shadow
Where no time escapes unhallowed

I am compelled to dissolve
into the eternal unknown eidolon
A voice that leads to a world beyond
a mere mortal's most profound dreams
Yet I know...
There is no turning back from here
There is no place for the undeserved
Gone are the relics!

Teach me your ways
Of hatred, unlight, and death
I offer myself to your wisdom
My allegiance is with the elite!

There is a voice adrift in the darkness
calling...calling me...
A whisper of wisdom and purity
Beyond the vestiges of sanity
There is a voice deep in the starless
and marble black dark space
Where no light draws a shadow
Where no time escapes unhallowed

An effigy; a gift from another kind

In the glow of a distant aurora light
No dreams shall take form
Gifts dwell in the depths of
things unspoken
this night...

7. Vales Beyond Dimension

I have arrived at the corridor of infinity; the great hall where the ages are kept
Behind ancient ash and primordial iron
The past is a mirror...aeons exist in a myriad cast
The vale before me; my own reflection

Another stands at the doorway of the maelstrom; a visionary to guide me through
Cracks reveal themselves in patterns of the distance
The past is a sphere
A mystic shape, a mode of knowing
A godless, perfect form in the quietus of passing

Between the vales of existence and the miasmic landscape of consciousness
The fabric of being has withered away; no longer there waiting for me

I have peeled away layers of my humanity
No longer a being, the core of entity
For each layer reveals the key to the gates of the multiverse

Through the doorway of a shaman's reality
A universe within the skull

Alas I stand at the threshold of dimension
The macrocosm has revealed itself as a towering serpent spire
The past has shattered...aeons subsist only in countless shards
The myriad cast of the vale; a thousandfold reflection


8. Plateau Of The Ages

1. Crowned In Thorns

Fear is spreading like a plague
The Salvatore is dead and faith with him
The flame of evil burning bright
As white turns black and day becomes night

Seduced by the words insanity speaks
Prayers unanswered but following still
Mournful sinners spill their blood
In hope to face their one true god

Charlatans fed on simple minds
Preaching the book of a madman's illusion
Religious foundation based upon lies
Will crumble and fall as the son of heaven dies

Wearing thorns with pride
As stupidity dies for mankind
Wearing thorns with pride
As stupidity dies for mankind

Like a sheep prepared for slaughter
Trembling in the deepest fear
A savoir of the human race
Forsaken by his own

Abandoned by his father crucifixion carried out
Confessing his loss, impaled on the cross

Fear is spreading like a plague
The Salvatore is dead and faith with him
The flame of evil burning bright
As white turns black and day becomes night

Seduced by the words insanity speaks
Prayers unanswered but following still
Mournful sinners spill their blood
In hope to face their one true god

Charlatans fed on simple minds
Preaching the book of a madman's illusion
Religious foundation based upon lies
Will crumble and fall as the son of heaven dies

Like a sheep prepared for slaughter
Trembling in the deepest fear
Mournful sinners spill their blood
In hope to face their one true god

Crucifixion impaled on the cross


2. Infernal Majesty

Enslaved by the summoning souls
Angels falling from the crimson sky
Raped by the unholy prince of eternal night
Global perfection burned by Satan

So it has been written with fire in the sky
Unholy presence shall strike
The earth with the holy lie
The throne is crowned
For a thousand plague filled years
Embraced by demon hordes
And conquered believers faith

You are the one prince of darkness
Obscurities manifest
Driven by betrayal and divine
Prostitution
Raised by the one who killed
Their firstborn offspring
You shall rule the cosmic storms
And embrace the beastly natures

So come to me my child
And I will show you this brand new world of mine
Come sit in the knee of Satan
And I will lead you to profound victory

Through this passing gateways of heaven
Straight down to hell
I will forever be embraced
By the father himself

Teach me father fallen angel
Wicked goddess truth you are
I can be your first disciple
I can be your god


3. Cell 666

Voices in my head
Telling me my god is dead
This burning hate, the urge to kill
When steel meets flesh the blood will spill

Caged within these walls
Lost among these mazelike halls
I must break out, I have to flee
I'm a prisoner of insanity

The world outside's my hunting ground
The innocent my prey
A game of slaughter, fear and pain
Do you want to come and play?

Charades in blood and lunacy
Give into your desires
Like Manson, Bundy, and Albert Fish
Feast upon a human dish

Bestial desire for human flesh

I'll stab you down and beat you
I'll cut you up and eat you
No remorse for the deeds I have done

A game of slaughter, fear and pain
Do you want to come and play?
Charades in blood and lunacy
Give into your desires

Who says death isn't pleasing

Death wields its scythe
With victorious might
No one escapes this inevitable fate
Not even the bringer of hate


4. Icon

Vessels of wrath overflow
A smile of pity for human nature
Defenseless mass psychosis

Thorns of perfidy for your own martyrs crown
An architect of butterfly wings
Needs no storm to fall
Defenseless mass psychosis

Samaritans with poisonous wine
Makes the addiction to a profit
Revelation to some darkness to others
The burdy ground is in mankind's mind

Icon of universal lies

I am an icon of universal lies
I am the burning hate in the beholders eye
I am the mourning prognosis
I am the queen in the serpents nest

Samaritans with poisonous wine
Makes the addiction to a profit
Revelation to some darkness to others
The burdy ground is in mankind's mind

I am all that you want me to be
I am all that you never can see
I am the shadow that stalks the night
I am the star that shines so bright
I am all the answers for the mysteries of earth


5. 7th Throne

Drink from my tempting chalice and you shall awake
Darkest hatred fills your soul
Rigid father, haunted one
Withering goddess truth am I

Dark desires fill the emptiness
Cleansing your infected flesh
Wear the armor, a hidden truth
Erasing former ethic rules
Millennium kingdom has to come
Enthroned by many but not by me
I'll be the one to set you free
Listen to your inner voice
There's a bran new world: to see

Rigid father, haunted one
Withering goddess truth am I
Dark desire fill the emptiness
Cleansing your infected flesh
Wear the armor, a hidden truth
Erasing former ethic rules
Darkest hatred fills your soul
Millennium kingdom has to come
Enthroned by many but not by me
Listen to your inner voice
There's a bran new world: to see

Downward spiral of never-ending lies
Fool the one who's blind that no one ever dies
Trust is his faith and deceiving is the game
I'll be the one to guide you through cosmic domains
Let me inside you to flow in your veins
Let me inside you to flow in your veins
I'll be the one to guide you through cosmic domains

I am many we are one

Give into your dark desires and release your chains
In the name of Satan I lead you into dimensions
Drink from my tempting chalice and you shall awake
Now you are mine forever caught in the cradle of night

There is no such thing as God
His son and the holy whore
... As God his son and the holy whore


6. Beneath The Lies Of Prophecy

Release the blindfold before my eyes
I've witnessed the cosmic aeon carnage
Passengers on the awakening course
Confessing their sulfur stinking existence

Masses for the tempted beast
Embracing black shepherds with human harvest
The sun shall never capture my face
Cause I'm born in the shadows of unhallowed grace

Teach me father
Reveal me father
Mark me Satan

Cause you have not betrayed your son
To secure thy own existence
Disguised in fame fooling the mankind
To read between the lines
Engulfed by the sickest of minds
I'm dragged into voids of darkness

Cause I have lived in a world of lies
Until you showed me where my soul descent
Beneath the lies of this prophecy
There's a world I have not recognized
Ohhh ghastly son of the mourning
Teach me how to comprehend

Hellfire wrath has been brought upon us
Crimson skies of sinners blood
No longer trapped by a mental disguidance
Black horizon opened my eyes


7. Reign Of Chaos

Cursing the light and the flame burning bright
I descend to eternal darkness
Tearing apart what once was my heart
Entrapped in this hellish domain

Disguised in white with golden wings
An angel only by name
Summoned from a world forgotten
Servant of the dark
A constant state of nothingness
Consuming all humanity
Insinuations of a godsend gift
Has now been put to rest

Cursing the light and the flame burning bright
I descend to eternal darkness
Tearing apart what once was my heart
Entrapped in this hellish domain
Entrusted as a bringer of death
Sent to this world from below
Twisting in pain with fear in your eyes
A smile on my face as I watch you die

As tables turn and joy becomes fear
The end of life is drawing near
A reign of chaos and aeons of pain
Mere tales of this world will remain
My chalice of blood raised to the skies
As grotesquery inherits the earth...
... As grotesquery inherits the earth

I am your eyes and ears
I am your dreams and fears

Mankind scapegoat an excuse for weaken minds
There's no fucking emission for your pity existence


8. Beauty Of Death

A seed of evil growing
Within my tortured soul
Becoming disillusioned
Raised with a saving cross
A blurry sight
Intoxicated flesh
The past is haunting me
Unvarnished nature
Emotional depths unite

Starring eyes reflecting disbelief
Loosing faith a messiah no more
A mind infected feeling hatred so strong
Avenging the past, practice sins by the book

My former faith is fading
Belief within me dies
Betraying Jesus Christ
A poor misguided kind
Beings of flesh and blood
Salvation can be yours
Thoughts of a world so pure
Exists on earth no more
Behold the blasphemy
Holding your banner high under sky
Thrust the nails of evil deeper inside

Starring eyes reflecting disbelief
Loosing faith a messiah no more
A mind infected feeling hatred so strong
Avenging the past, practice sins by the book

Come to me and I shall help you escape death
And show you all the ways to pure infinity
Believers faith raped by diabolical intercourse

1. Malignant

A helping hand from an ignorant father, results in your misery
Born and race with saying grace, oh please god help thee!!!
Your private parts are missing skin, how sacred you are

Seeing in believing, unfortunately my friend, your digging your own grave
No matter how, no matter what, at the end all just puppets in this lifelong circus
Blindfolded eyes, with heavenly disguise

Iiiaaahhhhhh

You backstabbing son of a bitch, how can you live with who you are?
Dedicate your life to the greatest lie of all?
Judging men for thinking different!!!

Casting your shadow over human landscape
Catching every moment for a chance to destroy
Oooohhhhh it's not meant to be
To fold your hands and get down on your knees

Ooohhh help me father 'cause I have sin
I think we better cut of some more of my skin


2. Sulphur Injection

Day after day my subconscious screams at me
You are a withering god!
A fix for the fun, a fix for the ritle, this feeling it drives me insane
Burning like fire I am empty again how can I leave this hell
How can I leave this hell!

I feed I breed my enemy, I feed I breed my enemy
Bad blood runs in my veins I'm devoted to this killer of pain

I feed I breed my enemy, I feed I breed my enemy
Bad blood runs in my veins I'm devoted to this killer of pain
Mother of malformation would you care turning the table?
Disgust isn't world enough, but still I care for you!

Mother of malformation would you care turning the table?

Look at those empty shells, manufacture by evil nature
Disgust isn't word enough, but still I care for you!
Are you the one that hates yourself, who pulls down the trigger that ends your journey?

Are you the one that hates your self to pull down the trigger to end your life forever?
Forsaken your life for him and nobody wants to feel

Are you the one that hates your self to pull down the trigger that ends your life forever?

Forsaken your life for him
And nobody wants to fell

Are you the one that hates your self to pull down the trigger that ends your journey forever?
Are you the one with the sulphur rain I should have killed you a long ago!

At least you piece of shit you should have killed your self instead of fed on others life
Instead of fed on others life, instead of fed on others life, instead of fed on others life!


3. Virus

Desperately you accept and inject the virus of truth
The masses seek and swallows lies and saviours
Drowning and dissolving in absolutions
This is our cause of devolution, always working to burn to deform this world
This is our cause and death solution we are praising guns pointed at our heads
Rise above the disease and it's mass, or would you rather crawl in the ashes of time
Do you blindly accept the crown of thorns and your illusions that you call divine
A blessing in the form of a menace injection
Yet whores of this kind they will always thirst for more
A blessing in the form of a menace injection
Yet whores of those kind they will always thirst for more

This world will bless us with the suffering!
From the very root of this sulphur disease

New world order that feeds, and implores death world wide
Your salvation is just lies and fucking chains!

Desperately you accept and inject the virus of truth
The masses seek and swallows lies and saviours
Drowning and dissolving in absolutions

On the brink of extinction bear the burden of my knowing
Light guides the way of our hell bound faith
Omens and signs are everywhere in front of you
The new era rising so prepare for this final battles

This world will bless us with the suffering!
From the very root of it's time
It's the proof that life and death collide

Desperately you accept and inject the virus of truth
The masses seek and swallows lies and saviours
Drowning and dissolving in absolutions
On the brink of extinction bear the burden of my knowing
Light guides the way of our hell bound faith
The new era rising so prepare for this final battles


4. Supreme Architecture

Standing in the ashes gazing out, the strength of cold blood reaches my heart
There's nothing left for me to return to my mind is totally torn apart
Indoctrined by a fake society never thought it would end up like this
Hell is everywhere death is by my side, this isn't an ordinary arcade

Stare into cubic dimensions am I alive or dead?
Die for an unknown cause, is this for pleasure or pain?
Hate keeps me alive!

You have to choose a side
Night and day will remain the same there is no one left alive
A carnal lust for killing I am chosen one
The chosen one I am

Show me the strategy to be supreme and to major goals that I need to achieve
Stare into cubic dimensions am I alive or dead?
Die for an unknown cause, is this for pleasure or pain?
Hate keeps me alive!

Hate my concubine since the beginning of time
I killed everyone like you told me to slaughtering souls for serving you
The time is mine when the stars go out!

Standing in the ashes gazing out, the strength of cold blood reaches my heart
There's nothing left for me to return to my mind is totally torn apart
Indoctrined by a fake society never thought it would end up like this
Hell is everywhere death is by my side, this isn't an ordinary arcade

Stare into cubic dimensions am I alive or dead?
Die for an unknown cause, is this for pleasure or pain?
Hate keeps me alive!


5. Vengeance

Determined for vengeance he was
Sold to a nation cold!
Raised out of ashes and crime
Stiff-necked and remorseless
Futility's womb bears fruit again
Burning like a cataract in those eyes
Inhaled the strength of evil prevail
A figment of the brain was what you were told
Proclaiming your insanity to carry out the surgery

No feelings left aside there's only life and death
A non existing man that kills for no reason
You makes me fucking sick!

Obtain pure terror for the greater good
Feast of human sorrow and enjoy others suffering
Pretend to be the savior, the holy masquerade, you bathe in others blood

What did you do to me? I don't know who I am and more
We didn't do nothing you were sick and needed help, some serious help
This has gone way out of our hands, we need to end this properly
You can't do like this there and law's and orders to be followed!

Determined for vengeance he was
Sold to a nation cold!
Raised out of ashes and crime
Stiff-necked and remorseless

Futility's womb bears fruit again
Burning like a cataract in those eyes
Inhaled the strength of evil prevail
A figment of the brain was what you were told
Proclaiming your insanity to carry out the surgery


6. Salvation Denied

Paint that scornful smile of your fucking face
We are all just numbers to be erased and rewind
An eye for an eye salvation is denied
Defrost your malignant mind and ride the wave of hate

Scatter the trails of the holocaust what a
Creed and for this you bleed
A merciless trigger finger a cosmic guillotine I am
You have never been so manipulated in your god damn life!
Salvation denied!

Acting of lies born in disguise
Hatred breeds hatred
Your first breath an asthmatic inhale of maculated air
The worlds looking glass broken for innumerable times
No bad luck for mankind just Armadeggon!

Acting of lies suck out your eyes
Bloodshed is bloodshed
In whom do you trust? Ashes to ashes dust to dust
Defrost your malignant mind eye for an eye
Salvation denied

Paint that scornful smile of your fucking face
We are all just numbers to be erased and rewind
An eye for an eye salvation is denied
Defrost your malignant mind and ride the wave of hate

Scatter the trails of the holocaust what a
Creed and for this you bleed
A merciless trigger finger a cosmic guillotine I am
You have never been so manipulated in your god damn life!
Salvation denied!

Acting of lies born in disguise
Hatred breeds hatred
Your first breath an asthmatic inhale of maculated air
The worlds looking glass broken for innumerable times
No bad luck for mankind just Armadeggon!

Acting of lies suck out your eyes
Bloodshed is bloodshed
In whom do you trust? Ashes to ashes dust to dust
Defrost your malignant mind eye for an eye
Salvation denied


7. Soulgrime

Here everything is nothing, collision of life and death
Beyond and here, far and near everything always ends the same
Another day, you're wishing to die
Another day, of cold inside
Another day, with you're rotten soul
Another day in this spiral down down!
Wake up and paint the gloomy face yet inside you still feel

Falling down in the abyss of pain, were life and death remains the same
Like a ghost you walk the earth and no one notice your presence
This world is dead inside, path that you walk towards lies and hate
Your darkest dream, your won existence
Born into a world of decay!

Woke up this night in sweat and tears
Alone you shall wander!
Screaming out in vain and no one could hear you

Here everything is nothing, collision of life and death
Beyond and here, far and near everything always ends the same
Another day, you're wishing to die
Another day, of cold inside
Another day, with you're rotten soul
Another day in this spiral down down!
Wake up and paint the gloomy face yet inside you still feel

Falling down in the abyss of pain, were life and death remains the same
Like a ghost you walk the earth and no one notice your presence
And no one notice your presence

Embraced my misery you are doomed to a life in the dark

Die die die!


8. Suicide Breeze

Wanted for treason I stand by your side
Smashing the last nail right through the eye
Perplexity spreading likes a fucking disease new world order suicide breeze
You're searching for answers that cannot be found obsessed like a madman it is keeping you bound
Release the insanity and taste it is good, load up your guns and do what you should
Baptized in fire you're heading for your goal, no one will stop you you're above them all
This guiding light of yours brings mass destruction and obscurity

I see it in your eyes that you're not sane, you cannot feel compassion or pain
There's something missing inside your head you've got to major interests death and decay!
That's what you searching for, this is the swarming of the gods, forevermore!

Holy holy is your war hell is the place that you looking for
You cannot separate right from wrong in the arms of death that's were you belong!

Wanted for treason I stand by your side
Smashing the last nail right through the eye
Perplexity spreading likes a fucking disease new world order suicide breeze
You're searching for answers that cannot be found obsessed like a madman it is keeping you bound
Release the insanity and taste it is good, load up your guns and do what you should
Baptized in fire you're heading for your goal, no one will stop you you're above them all
This guiding light of yours brings mass destruction and obscurity

Blindfolded and chained to the cross
Disciples of the world disease
Faith leads the way, towards the new holocaust graves

2. Bringer of Misery

Altar of the serpent
Nine candles are burning, between every other
Glimmer of incense
And morbid odor of human skull
True darkness surrounding us

Only love is sacred
Let hate be eternal
The pure odor of fornication and flesh
Loneliness, temple inside my head
Human soul, knowledge and the ruler
Hell is present, past and that which is yet to come
Future, despair and waiting, with me

There are no others in this room
And footprints already lost in dust
Perfect peace and nostalgy ruling
Tired of life and unclean
I pacify my mind and close my eyes

And we will see his glory again
O' Satan, the source of my power
Thy oneness is a flame unyielding
Immortal prince of the depths
Praised be thy name
And that, my power


3. Chalice of Death

The old, the great, the cursed ones
With rituals and black prayers
The majestic crimson dawn of glory
Everlasting damnation and Luciferian light

Deep green sea opens, raging to the horizon
Ground breaths forth desperate air
And from amidst the fire not seen by all
Beasts out the voice
From the darkness I cry for you

I see a fragile constellation
From beyond this universe
A breath of death to my inner hell
My light as by the will of it's creator
A spark from the forge within earth's core

If that breath could set free
If I could leave everything
And travel beyond realities
I would rise to my lips the chalice of death
And drink without the smallest besitation
Clear pleasure, lascivious strength
Fervent, mavelike power



4. The Prayer

All is made with human hands
Yet no laughter heard
But cracks on broken idols are smiling
When fire outpowered darkness became light
When you can't see Samael you're him

These words are silece, like all else
My master, why hast thou remembered me
Kneeling at my altar of everything
Three gates below grant paradise by breaking it
Behold through me, for you are the eye

Serpents crawl from older dusks
Soon hunting on altars of flesh
Knowing you I will become that prey
Which grows only stronger by it's perpetual death
And when I will stand on the ashes

I will see, I will see the face of God
The edge of horizon who split's the night
Hearing the blessing of discordant choir

From the depths I call for you O' Lord
From the forms and names I reach for you
You are the blood and you are the nerves
You are the hands that unite in prayer

All of it consumed, fools gold turned to blessing
The wounds upon my palms, pierced by no shawllow words
Still time to wake up, no time to look back, though

No more waiting
Indulge on blood-baked bread
It's everything from fertile ashes
Behind the stars, of darkness, of master
For my time, I have taken


5. Esoteric Spheres

No path, no one to witness my return
Through the darkness I flew
Questions turned to answers
Answers turned to awe
Despair, thou made me strong

Horrible yet beautiful, this unearthly domain
Made by no human hand
Seen by none but the chosen
For only few can understand this form of holiness
The lonely, the burning ones

When walls crumble - when floor gives away
Outside the cosmos - is still breathing
Beyond flesh and blood - more profane than those
Mysteries of Satan - unfolding in tranquil vision
Which I never left

Utter loneliness breeds lucid insanity
Fragments of man at your feet
The trail is took within, there is no other way
You must reach beyond dreams
Find something other to arrive


7. Spell of Penitence

Silent night, black as the abyss
Stars have fled this evening of northland
Human blood spilled in rivers
From hearts rejoicing their destiny
Behind is the baptism of black fire
Before is life and death, joined in eternity

Silent night, patterned by cold lights from above
As bowels of clouds are torn open
Revealed the shining treasures of space
Distant gemstones and the moonlike blazing moon
Under these our hearts weep again, again
To open to the sacred mysteries of Satan

Fratres, agnoscamus peccata nostra
Ut apti simus ad sacra mysteria celebranda

I have let the light tempt me
I have sought happiness before reality
I have thought there's something else but me
I forgot thy grace is in everything

Now, the heart of night is cut open, 
from darkness the visions of madness are spilled, filled with beauty, full of life


Knowledge older than man is revealed
By dedication, by the spells, and by the grace of Satan
Black embrace of night is opening all around me


8. Casus in Tenebris

Under the brightest powers, this is how it is mean't
And this is how it's always been, fuck the world

Sparkling like fire is that
Funeral procession in my mind
I am living that darkest time
Collapsing everything behind
From the stars and forest's I find myself
Closer to myself

I'd like to sink, but only as the darkness enters
Death is a holy communion before dawn of a new age

From darkness I receive my power, I feel so close now
Like a breath on my hair or touching my skin
As a stranger in this world
Red as blood and black as chaos is this touch
That I've adored just to see the truth

On the wings of burning chaos, riding the apocalypse
Let chaos come, I remain standing, I keep it in my embrace
Casus in tenebris, potestas umbrae et mortis

So beautiful is that nightwing along which we ride
The path of our ancestors
Along the life forgotten, as the ruins of burning world
Give rhythm to this procession

I am darkness who fell, light disppearing
Let destruction and harmony rise, from between life and death

2. Satan

The radiant ecstasy of being
The golden corona of suffering
Light from the depths
Coal-black unrefracted truth

Zoharic hidden glow
Collapsing of the hearts temple
Deeper night revealed
From amidst the storm-clouds
Starless ecstasy
Bliss of being

When the all is torn apart
Eyes vitreum pours out
The truth punctured
Overcome at last

The secret of love
Fullfilled in hate

Zoharic hidden glow
Collapsing of the hearts temple
Deeper night revealed
From amidst the storm-clouds
Starless ecstasy
Bliss of being


3. The Sacrament of Blood and Ash

To the teeth of the silver lion
The lamb has willingly bared its throat
A husk of mud shall turn into dust
cast off shall be the profane robe

In the fiery belly of the iron lion
The corpse of the lamb will burn
Until the remains of this offering
Float out from the bellowing urn

A pool of blood
Becomes a crimson sea
And thus a smouldering seed
Grows into a flaming tree

The age-old lie of shielding feather wings
Overthrown by the
reality of forked tongues
And a torch lit between the horns

The image in the obsidian mirror
Shows a newly-risen luminous man
Standing within a circle of warm ash
With his foot upon the skull of the lamb

Like a depthless ocean is the awakened soul
Yet not an infinite abyss of darkness
But one embracing a single sun

A pool of blood
Becomes a crimson sea
And thus a smouldering seed
Grows into a flaming tree


4. Devil's Fire

At the dawn he said
Let them burn, from the ash
We will build the new age
We came from the Azazel's star,
The others from the earth beheld by angels

We see the idol which the masses adore, we look beyond
I know that you look me from the other side, where the all ends
Where the esoteric dimensions binds evolution

Once I ignited the inner torch
I will never put it down
Reawakening is at hand
Warmth and love, o the great splendour
Devil's fire

We can travel to the world's end
Only to see the light
Nothing is different there
Nothing is different here
In his endless field of fog
There is only here and now, the blinding glow
The presence of our mercurial master
But still like the beginning,
There is just the illumination


5. Abyss

Flesh and bones together become a person
Stars above they fullfill
The martyrs scars and blood
As a new dawn for many, let this be the day
Of the stopped world, when heart opened

Hear the call of that pulse, descending to live
Six prayers from the gates of worlds ending
Be blessed unto life eternal
I can feel in my arms
Follow me, again and again

Into the abyss of my heart

Flashes from beyond the curtain
Call from the depths
Through the dead bodies
The graves are opened

Worship our master
Whos lurking in the shadows
Sharing thy beauty
Studying thy magic ablaze

Lights that illuminate my soul
Call from the depths
Between the two worlds
The graves are opened

Worship our master
Whos lurking in the shadows
Sharing thy beauty
Studying thy magic ablaze


6. Cold Eternity

This faceless world, think and behold yourself
In the place that did not exist before
You could not even imagine to experience this
This oppressing spirit, inhaling you within
Possessing, redeeming the fear of death with freedom

We are buried in eternity, into life
Above the shadows, serpents,
Worms at the altar of stone
Through the intense energy,
Gnawing the fog-veil of the moon
In the name of my lord,
Turning my world to become the light of mine

Into the empty mine of eternities
The chosen path has led
And to this furnace near to core
The story dregs I've fed
The gold from this darkest mine
Not of agnosticism, but the alchemic shrine
Purification of the soul
Cold eternity

Can you think how all this life is maybe
Just a yearning from somewhere
The voyage amidst all seeming vanity,
To find a new land upon which to construct
That is the fragile surface of reality,
In this cold eternity
In the name of my lord,
Opening the locks of death


7. Malignant Shadows

My master, the god of darkness
The angel of death
The black lord
Before the throne of truth

Stars and pillars, and the frozen waste
The quartz mantle over the dead
Come, we will go to him
With the wolves' faces
With the bird's wings
With the scaled skin
With thin voices
Smelling of musk and incense

In a place where there is no death
Nor life, only catacombs of sleep
They fork to lead unto the devil
And the animal shadows reach out

Where the blood has dried, we thirst
Taxidermists remembrance of desire
Where the life snuffed early,
The riverbed full of yearning
Looking back to him
Who can see between the worlds
Thoughtlessly they move in the darkness
Remnants of men
Cocoons hanging in the night, ripe the horror
Shriveled memory from the past,
Or is it from yesterday

Open your eyes and you fall
Where the malignant shadows await
Malignant shadows await,
Until the world may burn

We are the spirit without essence filled with past
Mucus from the yearnings forgotten and fever
Between the angels of the world,
Between the colours
Shadows cast by the mauve sun


8. Buried with Him

My eyes were blind for the night was mine
And the dark was the sustenance of my soul
Your sacraments down below, Lord Belial
Were mysteries of the worm for me to devour

My eyes drank your black light I O king who roars
Imprisoned I still was ravished by you
I ate my tormentors, I laughed through dry tears of a corpse
And in this earthen cask of rot I made myself anew

The brethren, like the wind that no longer blows
Inside this scarlet tomb we have rotten
What was the sin or the quest of ours? No one knows
But me and so long ago I have forgotten

Consepulti ei in baptismo, in quo et resurrexistis in Satanam
Out of the tomb of Saklas
In quo sunt omnes thesauri sapientiae et scientiae absconditi
Out of the tomb of being

Through the flesh, through this nightmare
I remember the wind, I recall the caress
Even drowned in blood, even strangled by hair
When buried with him in this cadaver palace


1. The Eye Of Oden

Up there on the mountain, above all fire,
the fields down there and the ravine below
Where the elements feast in reckless desire

A raven is seated
Where the sun cannot reach,
only terrific storms prevail
In a thunderin' havoc they ruthlessly roar

My heart it beats the pulse of ancient times
The countless rhythm, the rattling stones
My weapon cleanse the filth of all bones

Tender are the havens
which remain on the open plains
The shadow crawls
upon the resort of the remnaints
Even toward the hills lie shattered shields

The winter it hunts all their hearts in fear
And the river drifts with the resolution of thunder

Infernal are the storms in which our shelter stand
Their strongest grip of fear, and our shelter tear

Up there on the mountain, above all fire,
the fields down there and the ravine below
He beholds a kingdom of grace, savage yet fair


2. The Winterway

Awakened by the hands of Autumn
The hands which made me sleep
Straight in the eyes of winter
Was a shadow vague yet deep

A creature, spine of the essence
Drifting in the wind, clad as Sin
The force behind my cause
The hands that fold me within

Awakened beneath a restless sky
By mountains which darken the day
Shadows, spiritual dust of my fathers
- The heart and soul of my way -

A creature, spine of the essence
Drifting in the wind, clad as Sin
The force behind my cause
Grim token of the path within

The Winterway
Leads us through the coldest night
The Winterway
To be walked by all men of might

Behold the ice on the big seas
The summits and the naked trees
Ashore the bay through the rough
Winterway


4. A Tale Of Pagan Tongue

The sun descended to the ground
Behind the mountains, in the sea
A one-eyed man wanders sullen to the highest hill
There he will survey over those surviving will

The flaming shores are yet unseen
In spite of dawn, the horizon sleeps
The sea gleams with lethal cold
Witness yourself here, alone yet bold

The night is born, the christlings thorn
The sun seems dead and somehow forlorn
And the moon lurks above

The beasts they howl her song
Told to be unchained at the day of doom
Their random laws, taught by the Gods
Are to be redeemed when He sets sail

There will forever be this ancient tongue
Primal wisdom from natures own longue

Count the shores of the utter coast
And fear peace forever most
When time is ripe to revive the past
Let us see who stands triumphant

The echoes of cosmic strife
Borne to the one-eyed man
By the ravens of reminiscence


5. To Mount and Rove

I came from the utter fields
Carving shame on the tender shields
On my path I wandered high
Acknowledged beneath the sky
The hate I carried, recalling why!

I walked towards the rising Autumn
And cursed the summer
with the promise of a Winter
Where my foes will quiver in frost
A circling saga, not forever lost

I came from the utter fields
Carving shame on the tender shields
On my path I wandered high
Declaring war beneath the sky
The hate I carried, boiling within!

I mounted all the hills my eyes could count
And roved wherever the sun escaped sight

I drifted from the deepest tarn
Till I saw my saw my name in aruinic sign
Graven so deep in the crystal bark
Of a lodge I sojourned years ago

Crying war beneath the sky


6. Grimland Domain

The silence was utter, the sleep was long
A torment for even the brave
Peals of thunder even did not forsake
The lifeless soil of this eternal-white land

A domain of no mercy - White, so bright
As a day of calm, flawless might
Beware the coming of night
The shade of essential ingenuity
Acknowledge the darkness, link of dawn

The branches hung low
Softly covered by snow
Even the strongest will
Recoil beneath their silent chill

See the plains so eternally white
Bright, in spite of even the night
To be where the eagles fly
With a haughty hunters eye

Feel the kiss of the silver draped frost
Your age-old toil, haunted and lost
High up there, where His ravens once flew
The lightning strikes - even deep in the snow

You have to wake, wipe the ice from your eyes


7. Ascension Of Our Fathers


8. The Dawn Of The End

Pale like the skull of the sun
The way of the hunting moon
O storms that reign supreme
The breeze comes whisperin' soon

Strike the flowers' last gleam
In spite of desperate fight, their power
Leave no shores where the torrents stream

Mountains highest hills
Fragments, beheaded formations
The cosmic rivers curse
Denial of all recreation

Wind, Water, Earth, Fire - Invincible!

Autumn-twice, Winter-thrice
River and Rock
A new kingdom rise
I close my eyes

1. Oceans Rise

Deify the depths of intimate caprice
The noble morsel of the grand eternity
Face the furious and black domain
From where all the wisdom once came
As a weak and stunning flare
Yet so completed and clear

In the eyes of the elementary existence
May the fallen of eternity explode
As primal instincts of devotion
Where the seeds of chaos blow
Where the almighty substance flow

When the oceans rise
And thunder calls
The shape of furious manners fall
Where the oceans rise

Between dimensions asunder
The maze of fragmented flare
Harvest the pain of the will and despair
Where the seeds of chaos grow
Where the almighty substance bow

Milleniums are falling
Milleniums are calling
Hail!
The dawn of a new era


2. Universal

Mountains higher than mind can fly
Oceans deeper than sorrow
A distance of furious dreams
Random fields of tension
Where the sun comes blinding
When the moon goes hiding

I have seen the chaos in every course
Followed the solar dimensions of time
I have seen all the rivers stream
Yes, back to the end of the circle

Rivers longer than blood can flow
Horizons wider than complete wisdom
A distance of furious dreams
Isolated fields in convulsive motion

A distance of furious dreams
Random fields of tension
Where the moon comes glaring
When the sun goes dying

I have seen the chaos in every course
Followed the solar dimensions of time
I have seen all the rivers stream
Yes, back to the end of the circle

I can smell the air
I can taste the soil
I can tame all fire
I can spill all the water
I am the spine of the reversal nature
The blinding forces of complete defeat

Trace the universal steps
The shores by the course


3. Witching Hour

In the hour before dawn
The Nordic mirror lies black yet calm
Reflects my shadow and heaven above

The frost force the ocean up
Past the shores towards the mountain tops

Spirals flash green glittering blitz never seen
By the eyes of the selfpronounced clean
Through shining mists past the planet of witz
Mysterious realms still exist

In this black and blue void schiziod creatures will toy
With fragments of what once where souls
Dreamlike I follow their path dark and hallow
My feet barely touch the ground

Ride the radiant waves into unexplored space
Obscure scenery changes
Into trance without end to lunatics glen
Spellbound I kneel down in pain

The lurkers and I
Become one
As a hunters eye like the moon
Together we ride the storm
magic unfolds at the crack of dawn
Reborn

Like my fathers before me
I am shown the way


4. The Black Token

Behold the furious river
The river that comes with the time
Like a burning flood
A flood in the shape of every kind

>From the mountains to the shores
Trembling aflame within the core

I have come as far as the end now
To an existence where my soul belong
My cells forever redeemed
Recalling, the thorn so long gone

I have got an eagles freedom
And stormy power
I have got godly wisdom
And the silence of a flower

I am passing the orifice beyond
To the material origin, the elementary black

Behold the stunning blackness
Where the raging chaos steam
Like a token of flood
The dream that faces everyone
From the mountain to the shores
Still, trembling aflame within the core


5. Nocturnal Vision

The path was foreseen
In a feverish dream
and the riddle was shown
To the seven year grown
Reaching out for the thread he saw
It would cut through his fingers
As a razor sharp straw

Shaping the untouchable
Embracing the none-existable
It's force force drains
Slide into forever

Surface to surface
Nothing between
Faling forever
The illusion has been
But a fragment of time
On the thread of life

None shall pass
This fiery wall
None shall pass
No, none at all


6. Ad Noctum

Swept in a distant dream, I am bound
As a cunning waver trapped in it's line
Facing the cold, stuck in the mould
The magma here under makes fire seems cold

And I've been down below
And I've been high above

From flaring field of fiery formations
The sub dimensions aflame
Like a havoc in black when the force turns back
The surface tears open spills blood from it's cracks

The cause of the essence sharpen the lines of dimensions

I am raised by the fields, by the highlands
The minded mountains of old
Where the river starts roaring I roam
Where the wind comes moaning I wander alone

The course of the essence sharpen the lines
Of the dimensions I am trembling between
The inner cause of the utter cause
Reflections of the core

The furious nightmare of reckless erosion
Falling and climbing
A loop of convulsion
An eruption of evil takes form 
it is I
What once where shattered is gathered
Stand tall aim towards the night

The course of the essence sharpen the lines
Of the dimensions I am trembling between
The inner cause of the utter cause
Reflections within the core

Fire burn wisdom in me
Wisdom set mind and spirit free
Moonlight show me the mysteries of life
Winternight give me clearsight and storms to fight


7. Winter Millenium

Through milleniums of winter so waste
I have passed eras to following time
I have faced the force of the nocturnal course
Where the winter comes resounding

On the plains of the earthly wisdom
I have walked the silence yet furious fields
Seen the children of the cold
The elder and the bold
Burning by belief, yearning by deceit

Behind each embracing creature
I saw thousand fighting beasts
I saw the furious black colours
Like the jaws of a bloody feast

At the end of mans wisdom
I saw passion fly so terrible high
I heard sorrow groan
At the end which I found
Where live convulse resound

I came from a distance in time
From the hill where the sun for the first time came through
I followed every wind to every spot it blew
I rove the eternity of time, the history of existence

1. Rivalry of Phantoms

The tide of the substances
Furious force, a stunning course
A war unbroken
It's the coil of the combining ends
The dawn of the random fall

I summon the winter, the autumns son
The way of those, the way of mine
I summon the winds, the rage of storms
My way is for those, the sinner?s kind
Damnation groan, hear the call

The tide of the substance, spins in the core
Like a furious force kept stunning beyond
It's the coil of the combining ends
The dawn of the random fall

I summon the rivers the ocean?s son
The way of those the way of mine
I summon the motion, the presence of time
My way is for those, the sinners kind

Beware the sight of those
Those who were my sight
Beware the hate of those
Who rivals as the storms
Who storms as rivals
At the plains, in the havoc
The rivalry of phantoms

The erosion is my war, die you may
The wind i my passion. Utterly you weep
The rivers are my blood, drown you may
The wind is my passion, the passion to fight


2. The Presence is Ominous

Prior to the forces of primacy
Concealed by the essence, the profane
Withdraws in manners of erosion
Spine of the universal conflicts

Swept towards a new domain
Reversed in time, proceed in time
Swallowed by dimensions
Swallowed by the flames

I see fear so clear in the eyes
The eyes that burn by sight
I see fear so clear when you die

The cries that torches swept by
I am yet to see the good victorious
Thunder tamed by silence
I am yet to see the man victorious
Death tamed by life

Swept towards a new domain
Reversed in time, proceed in time
Swallowing dimensions
Swallowing the flames

I see fear so clear in the eyes
The eyes that burns by sight
I see fear so clear when you die

Spine of the universal comfilcts
As the motion of winds and oceans
I am on the isle of existence,
the mountains at my trail
I am prepared to die,
when the faith comes around to fail

Swept towards a new domain
Reversed in time, proceed in time
Swallowing dimensions
Swallowing the flames

I see fear so clear in the eyes
The eyes that burns by sight
I see fear so clear when you die


3. Ruins of the Future

Upon the ruins of the future
I climbed to behold
A distance so pale
An existence so cold

Resembling the views
These angels of damnation
As my mind came and flew

Upon the ruins of future
I stood to be told
That the future will fail
Upon the hands that fold

At the edge of the horizon
I saw the harmony of havoc
The path of the marauders
Transient yet tremendous

Upon the failure, denial of token
Upon the speech, in my tongue spoken
The sign, the pulse that protrude
The resound, the return
The sequence that conclude, the fall of man

Upon the ruins of the future
I climbed to behold
A distance so pale
An existence so cold

Resembling the views
These angels of damnation
As my mind came and flew

Upon the ruins of the future
I settled to be bold
When the downfall arises, as I am told

The denomination of the grandiose demise
Granted as the imious impetus

Upon the failure, denial of token
Upon the speech, in my tongue spoken

Upon the ruins of the future
I settled to be bold
When the downfall arises, as I am told


4. Colossus

From out of static time has grown
Existence formed by substance unknown
Prelude to matter, shift of disorder
Completion of bonds between chaos and order

The era of seasons, the essence of being
The continuous process awakens the living
Absorber of every flickering sun
Arranging the pieces to vivid perfection

The stream of mortality flows uncontrolled
A boundless downward spiral to prospective void
Existence takes its toll, extinction unfolds
The Colossus falls back from it?s treshold

The cosmic grip so tight. Heed the celestial call
The rise, the voyage, the fall- tangled womb of mortal soil

Universal key of inception, pulled out of the grind
The growing seed of creation and time

Complex fusion, the bond of four- the nature?s core
Universal ritual, aesthetic beauty adored

The pendulum upholds the carnal deceit
Eternal, endless, indefinite

The paradox, render and the merge is complete
Nothing but the process is infinite

Nothing but the process is infinite
Eternal, endless, indefinite


5. Inner Landscape

Incorporation
Analysis
Space/time, travel, silence, and freedom
Combinations
Flash back - fast forward
Repetition and rearrangement
Internal/external
Fragmentation


6. Invincible

I was born a fragment of future
Raised by the dawn of existnece
I grew as one with the elements
Shown the cause of extinction

I have seen worlds bloom to explode
And horizons flush into voids of fire and ice

I have seen worlds explode to bloom
The dawn, the existence and the fall
I was raised by the dawn of existence
Breathing the fire of every sun

I was born a fragment of future
Raised by the dawn of existence
I turned grey in the storm shadows
Showing the cause of extinction

The substance of invicible motion
is invincible as the substance in motion

We rise again as you fall
I have seen life extinct to bloom


7. Icon Dreams

The energy of the wisdom haze
Rinses the tide as a blend of fire
Upon the shores, where fires blaze
The pulse of time, shades of light

Plains stroked by the slumber sleep
Mountains embraced by rafting time
Swept into a new horizon
The source of life, the course at sight

Rise into a liquid dream
Where horizons burn, burn till dawn
My domain

Where horizons burn, burn till dawn
Rise into a liquid dream
Where the mountains groan, groans till dawn

The energy of the wisdom haze
Rinses the tide as a blend of fire
Upon the shores, where fires blaze
The pulse of time shades of light


8. Genesis Torn

Temptation impales the vulnerable
Transforming the breed as it strains to erase
Cleansing the body and perfecting the bliss
Falling further into its hypnosis

Absurd scenery of strenght and endurance
The mundane edeavours for the perfect resistance
Evolution axis bent. Manipulation results
Contrast condemns and the answer insults

Genesis torn
Enigma solved
Utopia found
Euphoria born

Expanding origin stagnates at last
Bows down in unity when paradise is lost
Dirt grows in catharsis - raise of the inbred
Totality rejects the efforts of the misled

Genesis torn
Enigma solved
Utopia found
Euphoria born

Extinction embraces the crippled presence
Altered away from the salvaging renaissance


9. Embers



10. Revolt

I fled the fire with my flesh and desire
Spilt the blood upon existence
Tracing trails, a furious tale
Spilt the blood upon existence

Barely touching the mirror of reality
The deformation of what depression denote
A spiritual fusion, drown in conclusions
Derail the path, the course that...

The solar solace within the hideous
Here upon the heralds of dawn
The dawn of eternity
A northern nobility
Revoke the revival of revolt

Burn the treason, the trinity
Yearn the heat of the fire
Face yesterdays tomorrow
The heralds of the past
The winds of a history cast
The profound spiritual fusion
Glimpse inward to my world

A fragment of fire, hordes of imagery
An illumination of all illustrations

The solar solace within the hideous
Here upon the heralds of dawn
The dawn of eternity
A northern nobility
Revoke the revival of revolt

Barely touching the mirror of reality
The deformation of what depression denote
A spiritual fusion, drown in conclusions
Derail the path, the course that...

I fed the fire with my flesh and desire
Spilt the blood upon existence
Tracing trails, a furious tale
To the centre of chaos

Burn the treason, the trinity
Yearn the heat of the fire
Face yesterdays tomorrow
The heralds of the past
The winds of a history cast
The profound spiritual fusion
Glimpse inward to my world


1. The Genuine Pulse

The zephyr, the sullen breath
Horizons of history re-erodent
The haven, where the stars are set
Constellations of manifestation
Aglow, expanding through forever

Fall with the rain, rise with the ocean
Drain to expire, the shrine of fertility
Burn as the flame, as strong as it came
Twine the existence, sense the serene
Thousand senses of virtual faction
Existential inputs, prediction of mind
Instinctive, raised to find

As the salt in the sea, burns in me
Forever, the taste in your mouth is I
Eternising the soul-soaked estate
Solvable as fractional fragments

Divine gracious divulgence
Pulse, rotation, the spine of creations
Wane as the circle of zero

As the salt in the sea, burns in me
Forever, the taste in your mouth is I
Eternising the soul-soaked estate
Solvable as fractional fragments

The genuine pulse - the link of a thousand senses
The genuine pulse - entire celestial allegiance
The genuine pulse - dense induce of the indomitable
Never to fail, thus existence I sail
Through the elements of four

The zephyr, the sullen breath
Horizons of history re-erodent
The haven, where the stars are set
Constellations of manifestation
Aglow, expanding through forever

Measure the circle of eternity
The treasure of ability
The Genuine Pulse


2. Gods Of My World

The Gods are great. I am the greatest

Mother of earth, mother of all
Father of air, father of all
Brother in flames
Sister of seas

Gods of my world, behold...
Pour rain on the fire
The fire that burns
The day of my birth

Gods of my world, behold...
Aflame my desire
To grow and to breed
The wisdom I need

Gather in the storms asunder
Condone the cosmic hibernation
Steam of rivers, the hive of oceans
Praise the fathers of all significance
The reckless burden of existence
Face the rise of the furious
The amend forces
The amend course

Gods of my world, behold...
Pour rain on the fire
The fire that burns
The day of my birth

Gods of my world, behold...
Aflame my desire
To grow and to breed
The wisdom I need

Gather in the storms asunder
Condone the cosmic hibernation
Steam of rivers, the hive of oceans

Recollection, my soul connection
The thrive of reflection, affection

Forever you'll be the tongue of mine
Through time and existence
By instincts divine

Forever you'll be the sight of mine
Through time and existence
By visions divine


3. The Black Canvas

The very maxim of the universe
Portrayed by the greatness the stars rehearse
Premeditated by nature's sense
A modest exuberance so intense
That every mind has failed to grasp it

Forged by time on the last of eternity
Complex constructions - a stellar fraternity
Spread out on a canvas of deepest black
The white glowing softness a fierce attack
On every space still to be filled by matter

A pursuance of that very first creation
Expansion and a constant alteration
The fringes of the canvas always stir
The boundary is bathing in a blur

Forged by time on the last of eternity
Complex constructions - a stellar fraternity
Spread out on a canvas of deepest black
The white glowing softness a fierce attack

That odious draught: insufficiency
Touched man as he climbed himself mentally
Along with his newborn dexterity
Came death to his fear - a corollary
Of the fact that the stars never sensed his presence

The very maxim of the universe
Portrayed by the greatness the stars rehearse

Even Narcissus would drown in the sky
If his eyes ever rose from the mirror ponds
This radiant image, a stellar high
Eternally feeding the question: "Why?"
To which every nightsky's a vast response

A pursuance of that very first creation
Expansion and a constant alteration
The fringes of the canvas always stir
The boundary is bathing in a blur

Forged by time on the last of eternity
Complex constructions - a stellar fraternity
Spread out on a canvas of deepest black
The white glowing softness a fierce attack


4. Matter & Motion

Always moving
Searching for patterns
Digging for angles
Clutching at straws, climbing in air
Opening doors, closing windows

Swirling
Expanding in our world
And outside


5. Soul Sphere

The guest of omniscience
Forthright eloquence
To behold the end of horizon
Observation of foresights
Inhaling circulations of the soul

The aura of stars, the fusion of frequencies
Measure of all, the blur of the frame that ceases

The certitude of generations' adherent
Perpetual folkways of the soul sphere
I grant my visions, the burden I bear

The aura of stars, the fusion of frequencies
Measure of all, the blur of the frame that ceases

I am midst by the cause of reality
Entwined by the senses of fantasy

I have walked through fields of grievance
Eras of spiritual fragmentation
I have walked through the woods of peasants
Dawn of the souls solar morning

The certitude of generations' adherent
Perpetual folkways of the soul sphere
I grant my visions, the burden I bear

The quest of omniscience
Forthright eloquence
To spear the hallow star
Conservation of the solar fuse
Exhaling circulations of the soul

The aura of stars, the fusion of frequencies
Measure of all, the blur of the frame that ceases

I have fallen through spheres of diversity
Eras of ending spiritual solemnity
Opened the gate of ion fire
The warming well of wisdom

Soul sphere - the fusion of senses
Soul sphere - the pulse of energy
Reflection of a soul's tear
Soul sphere - the fusion of senses
Soul sphere - the pulse of energy

I am the soul in the sphere. The sphere of the heir

The certitude of generations' adherent
Perpetual folkways of the soul sphere
I grant my visions, the burden I bear


6. Inherit The Earth

The parade of the quaternary symbiosis
Token of a divided existence
Univocal sense of the hallow consistence

A silver stream of cryonics stars

The corrosion of the reality narcosis
Negligence makes the future tense
Axis bent into never ending continuance
Exploring new ground, inverse and far

Coequal nexus of neural perception
Pre-eminent sample of hasting ions

Inherit the Earth
By the instinct of the fallen creation
The bow of the axis, inversely
Inherit the Earth

Coequal nexus of native perspective
Circular reminisce of history lair

Inherit the Earth
By the instinct of the rising creation
To bend the axis, eternally
Inherit the Earth

Past, present and future
Angels of thrice, fusion twice
Past, present and future

Inherit the Earth
By the instinct of the fallen creation
The bow of the axis, inversely
Inherit the Earth

By the instinct of the rising creation
To bend the axis, eternally
Inherit the Earth


7. The Stellar Dome

"Who am I to behold?"

Time revises the existence
Forms the timelessness of substance
Thousand paths of furious chaos
Circles the spine of the universe

All the ways that I have been
All the stars that I have seen

I have seen the haven of eternity
The hive of random universal unions
Expire, expand to extinction
Energized by the primal reflections

Resile the innermost inning
The energetics of the substance
Enframing the salt of existence
The gloat character of the gods

All the ways that I have been
All the stars that I have seen

I have seen the path of eternity
Solid constellations, formations
Sinking, through the black substance
Drifting, swiftly through dimensions

Through...
The Stellar Dome
My haven, my home

Through aeons sterile yet stentorian
I am circling twice my visions
Thrice the bait, dive with faith

Decipher of the immersed profuse
The frequency of foresight
The archetype
Of the stellar dome


8. Four Element Synchronicity

Glomeration of the four's constructiveness
An intelligental substance permanent
I sensed the elemental tenderness
In the wind, in Nature's argument

To breed, to grow, to peak, to be reborn
Like a sine curve in an endless loop
The day's crescendo dusk adorn,
A process ending in the crescent's droop

An example of what the substantial quartet can procreate,
Synchronized they operate

Water feed earth's production
While fire is fed by air's viability
Which compose water's construction,
The flux that strengthen earth's ability

Nature's own artful methodology
Where downfall becomes the interlude
Laws, which bases our current cosmology,
Completing the constant vicissitude

From storm-beaten mountains to calm-running rivers,
As old as the planets rotation
A work of an unknown intellect delivers
The symbiosis, the perfect combination

Water feed earth's production
While fire is fed by air's viability
Which compose water's construction,
The flux that strengthen earth's ability

Still though, provoked by a fifth force,
A dark companion, Vacuum, Devastator
But somehow the harmony stays on course
With the quartet's unity as profane creator

The result, arrangements filtered through our eyes
Several polarities evolved into a symmetrical guise

To breed, to grow, to peak, to be reborn
Like a sine curve in an endless loop
The day's crescendo dusk adorn,
A process ending in the crescent's droop


9. Liberated

From every human complexity
And nature's twisted analogy
An urge to explain - to understand
Springs out with the notion to expand
The narrow view of what we are

Could a mathematical formula
Improve our existential stamina
Would explaining our kin universally
Keep up our vital vivacity
Or would it enshroud us in disillusion

The notion of our emancipation
Lies far from any genuine liberation
Seeking a detailed explanation
We think therefore we're cursed

As questions multiply with every solution
The "why" stands untouchable - no intrusion
A constant flow of total inconstancy
A natural, starfelt divinity

Could a mathematical formula
Improve our existential stamina
Would explaining our kin universally
Keep up our vital vivacity
Or would it enshroud us in disillusion

The notion of our emancipation
Lies far from any genuine liberation
Seeking a detailed explanation
We think therefore we're blessed

A Machiavellian way of thought
In struggle with all that society sought
A full explanation's the king of our dreams
To know: what's our role in the scheme of schemes
Where is our place in this order of chaos?

The notion of our emancipation
Lies far from any genuine liberation
Seeking a detailed explanation
We think therefore we are


10. The View Of Everlast

Great and pounding in its ways
Stirring the roaming cosmic sea
Oceans rise, planets igneous fall
As chaos and beauty in fierce rage

Furious are the storms
Forever its rage carries on
Disintegrating to create, upon fate
Weaving the web of solar cast
Hasting the view of Everlast

Exploding, Imploding
Ascending, Descending
A spear through life and death
Exploding, Imploding
Poised in all chaos' directions
In fierce affection

Spawning the orbs of furious light
My sons of fire, you're children of the storm
Breeder of life, harvester of all
The last breath of the fall

Exploding, Imploding
Ascending, Descending
A spear through life and death
Exploding, Imploding
Poised in all chaos' directions
In fierce affection

Weaving the web of solar cast
Hasting the view of Everlast


1. Future Reminiscence

The mysteries of a hidden past.
Precession of the planetary relations.
Cosmology, a linear or circular cast?
Restitution of a genuine consciousness.
Return to the haven of the first and the last.

Beware, stare towards the horizon new.
Sear, tear the sensation of distant propinquity.

Through the secret moments I flew.
As one among the very few.

The everlasting zero, a glimpse of a million.
The forever million, yet a ubiquitous presence.
Coronate the path of the Gods, the Elder.

I am a remnant of the forever origin.
I am the soul of every phantom fallen.
I am rising as I am falling, silent as calling.

The precise prelude of the cataclysm.
Apocalyptic visions of the future fall.
The aberrant taste of the conceiving past.
As a slave of the next moment of presence.
The ones among the very few.

Restitution - summons the sight.
Emancipation - circles in presence.
Renunciation - for a new era to enlighten.


2. Traveller

Existential matters ignite in circulation.
A motion to bend, towards the swift end.
Encompassing a visionary plead to defend.

Liberation of the five senses, the ego phrase.
Metamorphosis of perceptual principles.
Platonic illumination of Natures' quincunx.
Which hemisphere is mine to hold?

Traveller of the x-scape, through endomorphism of time.
Hybrid existence - through spirituality endures the reality.
Traveller of the x-scape, through the gravisphere of wisdom.
Hyper potency - the predominant endurance through infinity.

The iridescence of the solar glimpse.
Through the eyes of Himm and Hippo.
Just another sole strike of the sun.
A stone in the hand or the thought of it?

Traveller of the x-scape, through endomorphism of time.
Hybrid existence - through spirituality endures the reality.
Traveller of the x-scape, through the gravisphere of wisdom.
Hyper potency - the predominant endurance through infinity.

Thoughts of a thinker.
Infinity of numbers.
Numbered thoughts.
Thoughts of infinity.

Numbers are the essence of all things and the metaphysical
principle of rational order in the universe

Liberation of the five senses, the ego phrase.
Everlasting metamorphosis of perceptual principles.


3. Origin

In coherence of the universal clue.
The elements served as our dictionary.
The vast and the narrow's rendezvous.
Where abstraction and the precise momentarily.

Shared an equal confounded abode.
But soon we entangled ourselves in that maze.
Then, nature's stratum began to erode.
As our fire burnt soil's face.

We suddenly changed our mind's nutrition.
To outshine the forces, became our probe.
Beauty we turned into perdition to prove that.
man isgreater than a microbe.

We're the voice of thunder and image of lightning.
It rove inside us since day one.
In past times we tamed the frightening.
A heritage leaping, from father to Son.

But the Son became imperial.
As soon as he mastered gravity.
World's resources were immaterial.
For his ennobled colony.

His urges with chaos reconciled.
Throughout land's and ocean's enormous spectrum.
The alliance continues until he defeats the fossilized.
History, sealed in a petrified museum.

But, we can't transform our origin.
Atoms stay atoms forever.
The senses of Nature will always win.
In this earthly endeavour.
From quantum theory to rustic haven.
The laws of origin control birth.
From feeble fool to strong maven.
Everyone inherit the earth.


4. Sealed Chambers Of Electricity

From the lonely, grey bricks of inaccessible places to the
massive stones of a shared foundation.
From a Mental clarity of inverted liberation to the
intricate web
forming ever-changing mazes.
Numerically understanding east to west,
only to snap in a single contraction.
Failing to grasp what all should know best as a perfect
circle of interaction.

An electrical chamber of vast capacity,
storing the pieces gathered by senses,
pushing through filters to see if it cleanses anything
leaning on intricacy.

A matter of movements in a cul-de-sac.
A set of sealed chambers - no compromising.
Collecting raw data - defeat or attack.
Remembering, storing and schematising.

An electrical chamber of vast capacity,
storing the pieces gathered by senses,
forcing trough filters to see if it cleanses anything
leaning on vivacity.

The mind's electricity clearing the vanity,
grasping the world through keyholes of sanity.
Anything leaning on vivacity.
Numbness in speech - not in visualisation - forms
intricacy's silent coronation.

An electrical chamber of vast capacity,
storing the pieces gathered by senses,
opening filters so that nothing cleanses all that is leaning
on complexity.


5. The Weight Of Wind

Through every thought.
On every surface.
Crossing every idea.

Lifting, gentle movements.
A certain direction.
Turning tides, opening skies.

Measuring the weight of wind.


6. Resonance

Thunderous events below the atmosphere.
Hibernate within my fissures.
Mind has compressed what it lent from the ear.
Like a diamond that sings of external pressure.
But this zenith is chased by a curse.
That time seems cruel to our memory.
Expressive bow strokes in the bodily universe.
Soon fade into a monotonous symphony.

Like solar flares that reach our plexus.
Through the cloud chamber's web.

So we learnt to forget about essentiality.
And deny the primal frequency.
But its spirit still exists in me.
As my existence is its gree.

Like fertility found its mother in fallow.
We found our ethics in each other.
Organic development was to follow.
And intelligence defeated pother.

Earthquake: Its stentorian chord.
The core's hollow choir.
Fields tremble where Alps aboard.
The resonance, that even deletes fire.


7. Relate

A flat planet in the centre of the universe.
Who punctured us?
Who thrust the needle into our flesh?
Geocentrism came crawling back - licking the needle marks -
"Copernicus was never right", and our world turned as
introvert as our minds.

Kepler, Copernicus & Galilei suffocating in the vacuum of
the microcosms.
The inside can wait as long as we're preoccupied with
shining the facade.

We brought this upon ourselves - the connection breach.
We cut the rope, we shut the power down.
The line does not reach out any more.
Diagonal traded for horizontal - there is no up and down.
Gathered, trapped, closed into a linear thought.

Kepler, Copernicus & Galilei suffocating in the vacuum of
the microcosms.
The inside can wait as long as we're preoccupied with
shining the facade.

Somehow we lost the ancient connection.
All perspective eaten by newborn abilities.
Entangled no more? - Simplicity the order of absent
relations.
Complexity a distant relative or a strange rumour.

Reflective surfaces mirroring skin, cores diminish slowly
and silently.
Nourishment torn away, light dimmed to the unrecognizable.
Show us your universe and we'll give you our world - we do
not recognize it anyway!


8. Cyclus

I am soon to reach the pith.
My spherical vile so sacred.
Engendering the divine fusion.
Visions of emerging stars.
I am about to stake my stance.
Fly above the precluding fence.
The cosmic feast I am to gasp.
To honour the divine cast.

Cyclus - frames the core of the causes.
Circle - the way of the forces.
Gods, I am here to prevail.
End the subsequent existence.
The resound of thousand tales.
Hear the call, stirring the fall.

Reinstate the lurid, lunar existence.
The renaissance of primal founders.
Stamina, the retrace of revival.
Synergy of entire universal courses.
Energy of the stellar host.

Cyclus - frames the core of the causes.
Circle - the way of the forces.
Gods, I am here to prevail.
End the subsequent existence.
The resound of thousand tales.
Hear the call, stirring the fall.

Gods, I am here to be and become.
Combine the rotating sequence.
Trig the fall of the presence.
Here the call, stirring the fall.

I am about to stake my stance.
Fly above the precluding fence.
The cosmic feast I am to gasp.
The honour the divine cast.

Gods, I am here to prevail.
End the subsequent existence.
The resound of thousand tales.
Hear the call, stirring the fall.
Gods, I am here to be and become.
Combine the rotating sequence.
Trig the fall of the presence.
Here the call, stirring the fall.


9. Circled

Thought formed the earth as earth formed the thought -
it flew with the wind as the wind always sought the fire of
feat,
the soma of motion,
producing the sweat that set off the corrosion that made the
flesh turn into earth again.

So let the water drink you as Ophelia did -
beloved daughter and cherished sister.
Or worship the earth that Pompeii once hid,
differing not between vagrant and minister.

Take heed to the wind and its soft fingertips and fire's red
thoughts and smouldering lips.

So let the water drink you as Ophelia did -
beloved daughter and cherished sister.
Or worship the earth that Pompeii once hid,
differing not between vagrant and minister.

Sense - will you show me the way to the matter of radiant
living,
of having to shatter the fundamentals of intoxicant
thinking?
Opposing the stream , never stirring or blinking,
but firmly preserving Sisyphus' work.

The boulder rolls heavily - is it in vain?
Deducing the truth again and again.
The wind speeds up as the earth turns hard.
The mountain swells up but reaps pure disregard from
mythology,
history and all in between.

So let the water drink you as Ophelia did
beloved daughter and cherished sister.
Or worship the earth that Pompeii once hid,
differing not between vagrant and minister.


10. Inner Ocean Hypothesis

Algae and plankton sporadically rinsed up effectively.
Seaweed clad naked continents in green veils.
From stardust constructions, cells elusively.
Rearranged the scenery in numerous scales.

A primitive organism, predecessor of mutations.
Along the evolutionary ladder crawled ashore.
In water transformed during thousand generations.
Then made its debut on the primary action floor.

Still its ensemble accumulates our presence.
The expression of oceans lurk inside.

The building block, water, is our essence.
We're like a moving, perpendicular, biological tide.
Salt spices blood, sweat and tears.
As the bodily recipe's most essential grain.
Due to the wave creator, Heart, pulsation rears.
As rivers through what anatomy calls veins.

And limestone-white structures hold our marrow.
As in marine animals that swim free.
But we're separated, through tiny variations along time's
arrow.
Unknown to the fetus in the Amniotic Sea.
The quintuple man, the five senses division.
Add two for the number of world's oceans.
And two hidden gene threads may fulfil that vision.
Intuition and instinct create the seven faceted motion.
Particles that once streamed astray.
Now form the basis in our DNA.
Salt spices blood, sweat and tears.
As the bodily recipe's most essential grain.
Due to the wave creator, Heart, pulsation rears.
As rivers through what anatomy calls veins.


11. Quintessence

The principles of the quintessential four.
Surrounds the inevitable future lore.
Untangle the path of a circular cast.
The symbiosis of earth, air, water and fire.

Soaked by water, a blinding tear.
Nothing to see, nothing to flee.
Burnt by fire, the future I sear.
Everything I'll see, everything I'll be.

Raised by earth, womb of all origin.
Nothing to seed, nothing to breed.
Exhaled by air, puzzle of gaseous spinning.
Everything I'll breathe, everything I'll feed.

Midst of the parallax, I mirror the illuminations.
Fall, rise and further evolution.
Midst of the parallax, the maze of illustrations.
Fall, rise and fatal conclusion.

Soaked by water, a blinding tear.
Nothing to see, nothing to flee.
Burnt by fire, the future I sear.
Everything I'll see, everything I'll be.

The principles of the essential four.
Strengthen and bond, the core.
Tangles the math of a circular cast.
The erosion of earth, air, water and fire.

Omnifarious - earth.
Omnipresence - air.
Omnipotence - water.
Omnivorous - fire.
Ominous for the omniscient.

Soaked by water, a blinding tear.
Nothing to see, nothing to flee.
Burnt by fire, the future I sear.
Everything I'll see, everything I'll be.

Raised by earth, womb of all origin.
Nothing to seed, nothing to breed.
Exhaled by air, puzzle of gaseous spinning.
Everything I'll breathe, everything I'll feed.


12. The Wonder

Celebration of life in all its forms.
The visionary scope of wonders.
Confluent and figural scenery.
The resilient existence of the past.

As a drone of the inevitable progress.
The carrier that breach the horizon.
I see the winter all summer through.
Moments inducing the way and sight.

Dark is the astray, as the olden domain.
Illumine the wonder new.
Spiritual moraine, a phantom brew.
The wonder - of the solar/lunar peak.

Through the glimpse of the moments.
Query presence of celestial wisdom.
Mirrors summoning fires igniting.
Fires inducing the day and light.

I see the winter all summer through.
Moments inducing the way and sight.
The path I have chosen is the spring of you.
A wonder ignites, ahead, towards infinity.
Welcome!


1. Earth Imagery

Amongst the elements, I surrender on eternity's behalf
The soil on which I walk, the air in which I talk
The drop I swallowed, the fire I followed
- is the circling direction of time, the vague line of existence

The earth defines my synergy, the mountains refines me energy
The fire clouds my distant view, the flame erupts my fiery due
To Mother Earth

The ocean mirrors my purpose, the rain affirms my goals
The air shrouds my presence, the wind reveals my existence


2. Grains

The grains of my solid roots
Go deep into the youth of existence
They mirror the path of my forefathers
Through the winter way alone
To mount and rove- to evolve

As the sun, the very one
Enlightened the road I found
Along the grains of ages
The roots of my being
Projects all that you are seeing...


3. Oceans Rise

Deify the depths of intimate caprice
The noble morsel of the grand eternity
Face the furious and black domain
From where all the wisdom once came
As a weak and stunning flare
Yet so completed and clear

In the eyes of the elementary existence
May the fallen of eternity explode
As primal instincts of devotion
Where the seeds of chaos blow
Where the almighty substance flow

When the oceans rise
And thunder calls
The shape of furious manners fall
Where the oceans rise

Between dimensions asunder
The maze of fragmented flare
Harvest the pain of the will and despair
Where the seeds of chaos grow
Where the almighty substance bow

Millenniums are falling
Millenniums are calling
Hail!
The dawn of a new era


5. White

Again
The empty room
White and unmarked,
though touched
With a sensible structure
Underneath the surface
Hiding in the corner of the eye
Or resting right outside the field of vision
No doors or windows
No entrances or exits
Only bright light
Forming a shining empire
Of electrical impulses
Never to leave the premises
Never to be caught
Only sensed


6. Cynosure

Stellar flames create formations,
Lucent constellations and invitations to the expeditious mind
Novas that see our destination
From their hibernation, a vocation that is enshrined

I'm navigating along the star path
The night sky is my compass, my cynosure
After days with waves of wrath
I'm finally reaching the shores
Under the burning Atlas

A region filled with flaring birthmarks
Over ageing landmarks and the hallmarks of Nature's grand form
Yonder, still in our respiration
And mother to rotation, gravitation that endlessly performs


7. The Human Nature

As a slave to differential rotation,
you cannot escape before eons have passed
As a servant to progression's motivation,
you won't leave until the future is the past

As a product of what we call inventions,
we cannot run before we can walk
As a victim of a myriad of intentions,
we must learn to think before we talk

Swept in the circles of endless repetition
Trapped in orbit around microscopic riddles

The answer's echo eliminates the question
Our unnatural nature keeps rotating between two cradles


8. Acclimation

Symbiosis is my guiding force
Like the wind against the window I adapt my course
One moment a firm wall of traditions
The next an exploding substance of variations

When the weather changes, so do I
To contrast I am a slave
As the oceans alters, so do I
A thousand faces for every wave

Acclimation: in the shape of a human
Adaptation: governed by blood and sun


1. Havoc

Nature is about to regain
The firm bastion of existence
A circular and furious monument
Of the everlasting remnants of evolution

The winds rove beyond the mountains
Lurking the bate-the delusion of faith
The storm distends,retribution descends
The people of the sham,kneels in shame

Havoc...

As the blood in my veins
Comes around to claim
As the roots of my trails
Come around to tame
The dignity of Nature

The winds rove beyond the mountains
Lurking the bate-the delusion of fate
The storm descends,retribution distends
The mankind of earth,praise the new pagan path

As the blood in my veins
Comes around to claim
As the roots of my trails
Come around to tame
The dignity of Nature

Nature is about to sustain
The evolver of existence
The moment of care and fear
The revolution of evolution

Storm of the millennium, havoc the moment
Rivers unfold, abruptly in deep oceans

A breeze, a storm -havoc

Storm of the millennium, havoc the moment
Rivers unfold, abruptly in deep oceans


2. Reason

Peeling the layers
to expose the facts
was like spraying
and ancient painting
with ammonia

Faces melted,
colours turned pale,
shapes lost their vivacity
and essences faded
to distracted blurs

Now the canvas is all white
and my hands are unsoiled
Still all reasons seems replaced
By the false notion of a lucid portrait

Yet again, the savage remains

This empty work of art still gains a crowd
The blind eagerly discuss
the liveliness of its colours
and the deaf insist
it's accompanied by quiet chants

The painter,
a highly praised
but anonymous deity,
lurks in the periphery of the exhibition
amused by the fuzz he is causing,
despite his many flaws

The canvas is all white
and my hands are unsoiled
Still all reasons seems replaced
By the false notion of a lucid portrait


3. The Stir Of Seasons

Seconds, minutes and hours
The pace, a momentary notion
Sand, stone and mountain
The entwinement of time and erosion

Children, youth and the man
A pristine face moldered by seasons
Summer, autumn and winter
Behold the recoiling stir of the reasons


4. For A Thousand Years To Come

A new dawn is rising
To enlight the ruins of the future
As a distant echo from the past
Circles above , roves of the skyline

Circles above, roves the skyline
Dives into the future cast

Years to come, years that passed
a presence cached by the wind
Woven in reminiscence and mystery
Manifested by the dome of history

Nature strives towards a new dawn
Mankind oppresses, resigns and falls
Into perverted conceitedness

Millions of nights
Millions of days
existence endure through sharpen margins

Thousands of years
Thousands of ways
all paths lead to the final steep fall

Through the brim of the sun
Along the ring of the verge

For a thousand years to come
Comes the autumn, winter, and spring
For a thousand years to come
Comes birth, life, and death

For a thousand years...

For a thousand years to come
Comes birth, life, and death

Nature strives towards a new dawn
Mankind oppresses, resigns and falls
Into perverted conceitedness

Millions of nights
Millions of days
existence endure through sharpen margins

Thousands of years
Thousands of ways
all paths lead to the final steep fall


5. Abrasion Tide

We're ensnared by the fate if persistence
As the forces of nature interact
To weather slope and mountain, close and by distance
Creating expanding ventifacts

Running water conducts the erosion
Leading grains of sand in the grind
Empowered by wind, time, and oceans
To wear down soil's rind

A tide that changes primary plains
Even principles positions
A flood that runs untimely through the elements and our veins
Shifting our focus and our definitions

New perspective from a vaster reflection
Thoughts flow like water from a hillock
That's repeatedly rinsed, achieving friction
Releasing knowledge of the rock

An archaic course across the outer core
Seasons transform while remodeling the Solum
Above the altering scenery stars soar
Watching the drama like diffuse phantoms

The land is disintegrated by a power that was ice bound
At the same time fertilized
As our forefather's feet touched a ground
That nature constantly has revised


6. Fleshflower

White petals
Red lines
Highest heaven
Deepest mines
Vertically green
This is how it's seen

I never thought the world would come to this
I never thought it would come to this

Sturdy feet and arid ground
Dusty shoes and not a sound

Sturdy feet and arid ground
Dusty shoes and not a sound

Soft, red glow
Ever so slow
Never
Near
the flaw


7. Worldwide

The principles of the nature
Firm shapes of consistency
A treasury concealed in time
Inevitable, invincible, an axiom

Diversity crafted by evolution
Yet the path of the future is carved in rock
As the horizontal horizon
As the vertical steeps of summits

The master and the apprentice
Forgotten moments in history
Mankind wanders, mountains stand still
The master and the slave
A congregation that never deceives
Mankind dies, havoc never stills

Fire oppose water
Water oppose fire
Earth oppose air
Air oppose earth

The way of the world
The route of existence
Worldwide - mankind's resistance

The way of the world
The route of existence
Worldwide - nature's persistence

Fire oppose water
Water oppose fire

The master and the apprentice
Forgotten moments in history
Mankind wanders, mountains stand still
The master and the slave
A congregation that never deceives
Mankind dies, havoc never stills

Diversity tamed by devolution
With delusion comes confusion
Where the crossroad never crosses
The path circles for all eternity


8. My Domain

There was a time
A time when every moment showed
A place where the symphonies shone
Through branches and leaves
The symphonies of nature...

There was a time
A time when one grew with trees
A place where the seeds were falling
Through branches and leaves
The creation of the Nature...

There is a time
A time when the past returns
A place where winds stir
Through branches and leaves
The dawn of a brighter sun
A disharmonic enclosure

There comes a time
A time when the sun implodes
A place where the current stills
Under the branches and leaves
The moment that ends
The night of eternity descends

The last sunset of my domain...


9. Coalition Of The Elements

My everlasting rivers
The breach of symmetry
Empowers the bloodline

The nature and I
Echo's the quake of the entities
The fierce disharmony
Defeats harmony

The river, the course unfolds
Drains the rain, snow and ice

The rock, the sleeping bastion
Cleaves the ice
Dissolves the snow
Divides the rain

The river, the course unfolds
Drains the rain, snow and ice
The summit, the gravity
The steep line of existence

The story of chapters sealed
Monuments never seen
Of coalition and conflict
The river and the rock

The sand, the rock, the ruin
Piles where the winds roar
Frames existence in certainty
The nature and thy
Echoes the quake of the entities
The fierce harmony
Defeated disharmony

The river and the rock

The river, the course unfolding
Drains the rain, snow and ice
The summit, the gravity
The steep line of existence


1. Epochalypse

The impact of meteor collisions
sprays rock over desert sand
I've seen the subversion changing our conditions
in the wildfire that scorches the land

A region flooded by horizontal cataracts
drowning in the debris flow
A force that despoils every human artifact
the deep and the shallow

Chains of extinction
in disruption's primordial hall
I hear the roaring legion
of ocean waves, trumpeting the downfall

I taste the salt, the seasoning of time
and smell the smoke of lightning's clime

Chains of extinction
in disruption's primordial hall
I hear the roaring legion
of ocean waves

A sudden cloudburst mounts the sky
lashing the shores of hope
I feel the arctic cold
as the elemental hazard
unfolds...

Years turn to decades, centuries to an era
A worldwide crisis opening its caldera

Chains of extinction
in disruption's primordial hall
I hear the roaring legion
of ocean waves, trumpeting the downfall


2. Roots

The roots thrust – into oblivion
beyond the verge of space
The erodent roots, the evolving loops
thrusts, yet free roaming

There is a horizon folded
blinding leaves of the universe
Throughout the inner core
my quest, my lore
Where the seeds recoil and return
where the potency explodes to burn

Where the roots weave into the branches
where dimensions blend into infinity
Where the seeds recoil and return
where the potency explodes to burn

There is a path running free
quintessential chemistry
Where the rivers recoil and return
fallen stars explode and burn

The branches reach into eternity
beyond the verge of stellar time
The evolving tree, the revolving spree
anchored in me means floating free
No time, no space can ever be
my hive, my home
I belong beyond the stellar dome

Blinding leaves of the universe


3. The Beauty Of Dead Cities

Concrete cracks, gives way to green
forests fall come glass and steel

The beauty of dead cities
the splendor of nature

Glass framed cities
untamed gardens
Wings in the meadow
asphalt hardens

Everything in its place
the duality of the natural order
An unforgiving faceless warder

Powerful green forces gray away
steel constructions lead life astray

The beauty of dead cities
the splendor of nature

Nature regains its natural place
cities absorb their needed space
The duality of the natural order


4. The Earthling

Children, behold the elders falling
hear nature chime, the widow calling
See that moldered face, once gazing
throughout horizons, throughout seasons

Men, behold the nature tolling
hear the depravity of man
See the sunshine blurring, once sharp and gleaming
Throughout winters, throughout summers

Nature, the venomous path of man
the existential gravity, the blinder of light
Mankind, bestride the glimpse of the Sun
instinctively oppose, the harvester of light

Elders, hear the mountains calling
behold the certainty, the leaves of future falling
See the downfall, in midst of the havoc
throughout ages, throughout generations

Nature, the venomous path of man
the existential gravity, the blinder of light
Mankind, bestride the glimpse of the Sun
instinctively oppose, the harvester of light
Dwelling the night towards further sight

I am the earthling, bearer of the past
I am the earthling, dwelling the presence
I am the earthling, exploring the future vast
I am the weaver of the Sun

I am the earthling, I am the weaver of the Sun


5. The Plains Of Memories


6. Mount Regency

Behold the northern plains
the entwined wintry mountains
Seasons of the cold, haven of the bold
the greatest column, the bearer of the sky

The winds are stirring and blurring
the seditious omen of erosion
A frozen spear of disharmony
the shattering yet celestial notion

Through the forests, wandering
Through the valleys, hasting
Upon the mountain shoulder, bleeding
The summit, the release of mind

The winds are stirring and blurring
the seditious omen of erosion
A frozen spear of disharmony
the shattering yet celestial notion

The rough side of the mountain
climb the bastion of existence

Hail this mountain, cherish these paths
the vast outskirts, the verge of existence
Where the winds sweep, corrode and explode

Behold the northern plains
Behold the wintry mountains

Hail this mountain, cherish these paths
the vast outskirts, the verge of existence
Where the winds sweep, corrode and explode
The momentum of horizon
the call of Mount Regency


7. Frostrite

Moving through fields
away from the great sea
up to the barren and cold

The wind gathers might
as the last trees passes out of sight
I plunge into the blight

Frozen landscape
see me, feel me
Awe strikes where even the air bites
and ice ceaselessly survives

Blue shades on white
announcing the rite taking place here tonight
Fading to black then explode in attack
hits the blazing northern lights

Spellbound I fight
the chaos, the colors painted in flight
And I watch and I sink in the snow but in spite
of this call from the other side I rise

My mind at ease
war harvest peace
Blood, fire
death cannot freeze

My father's gods
grant wisdom and odds
this is their gift through the bond

A spearhead, a zeal
I know what is real
to no one, nowhere I kneel

Frozen landscape
touch me, heal me
Awe strikes where even the air bites
and ice ceaselessly survives


8. The Winter Eclipse

A long gone presence unfolds
through the eye of the winter eclipse
Where the moments of history hold
the shadows of a vast ancestral cast

This path walked by generations
eroded by man, illuminated by the Sun
Ancestors and fathers, as fathers and sons
the everlasting continuance

Of time, space and diversity
the bias of cosmic regency
manifested by the vast complexity

The winter seasons, the pain of sorrow
The fallacy of chaos, the emptiness of hollow
The cogency of reason, the reversion of future
The maze of evolution, the ways of elucidation

Ruinous and regenerative
the hive of an oscillating existence
Resounds through the halls of silence
rebounds under the dome of origin

Ruinous and regenerative
the hive of an oscillating existence

Of time, space and diversity
the bias of cosmic regency
manifested by the vast complexity
through the winter eclipse

This path walked by generations
eroded by man, illuminated by the Sun
Ancestors and fathers, as fathers and sons
the everlasting continuance

A long gone presence unfolds
through the eye of the winter eclipse
Where the moments of history hold
the shadows of a vast ancestral cast


9. In A Deeper World

Deify the universal coherence
existence
The progeny of subsistence
bearer of man, the heirs of amend

Soak into the stellar magnitude
Rise towards the sky

In a fiery union with nature
as one with every creature
Rove the windy mountains
fall of man, drain in the sand

Rise towards the sky

In a fiery union with nature
as one with every creature
Rove the windy mountains
fall of man, drain in the sand

...in a deeper world

Deify the universal coherence


10. Age Of Creation

Through the wind of inquisitiveness,
A total view travels the ray of nature's benevolence
From the nest of fragments wholeness once flew
To set out a striking confluence

Where eye meet the biospheres ability
Chaos and order shaded by equilibrium
In coherence with progression's liberty
to form an intrinsic dictum

The practice of the mountain
A symbolic father and volcanic fountain
Refined by time and knowledge
A tower for future generations
Illuminating the age of creation
As we build a world with mind, hand and heritage

Until we mount the philosophical throne
Bowing to the lords of this ecotone

Where a chaotic substance condenses into solid black
An old servant in the play of havoc
Painting land over craters grounding
A creator now numb by man's eager pounding

The prominent pillars, the pyramidal peaks
Map impressions in the chamber of exploration
And keep them safe from a sun to bleach
sculpting inner elevation

The practice of the mountain
A symbolic father and volcanic fountain
Refined by time and knowledge
A tower for future generations
Illuminating the age of creation


1. The Rhymes Of The Mountain

The mountains chime
Avast the relentless rhyme
The majesty, the regency
Revails the everlasting rivalry

Crowned by the haze of history
A ferocious tore
A regaining core
Ordained by the weight of gravity
Echoes through the halls of lore

Echoes through the halls of lore
Crowned by the haze of history

The monumental fortress of primal grace
Shimmers beyond the horizon astray
Vast and wondrouds cast of the glorious
Harmony, diversity, adversary

The cycle of all
The rise and fall
Exuberance in waste
Depravity
Excellence in barren nobility
The lore of monumental regency
The rhymes of the mountain

The cycle of all
The rise and fall
Exuberance in waste

2. Winter Thrice

The sound of the groaning frost
Enforce the waves of blinding winters
Days of reaping, nights of aghast
Seasons aligned, under the wintry sign

the groaning, moaning sound of this frost
A blinding eternal blizzard
Seasons aligned and now under the sign
Of crisp eternal winter

I have wandered the skies
throughout the stellar neck of nowhere
I have swarmed the horizon
Throughout the eternal fields of everywhere
Time and time again
From shore to shore, from star to star
The deep bloodlines of the earth as seen from afar

Upon the ground of rumbling ruins
History shattered, moments withering
Raving forces of the inevitable

I have wandered the skies
throughout the stellar neck of nowhere
I have swarmed the horizon
Throughout the eternal fields of everywhere
Time and time again
From shore to shore, from star to star
The deep bloodlines of the earth as seen from afar

Nature, the cast of the future
Upon the ground of rumbling ruins
History shattered, moments withering
Raving forces of the inevitable
Reigning unions of the nature
the regaining cast of the future
From shore to shore, from star to star
The deep bloodlines of the earth as seen from afar

Horizons that hosts no scenery
Starless, unending skies
Wakes the beastly void
Winter thrice

Horizons that hosts no scenery
Starless, unending skies
Wakes the beastly void
Starless, unending skies
The dance of stardust stills
Drapes the mountain
Winter thrice


3. Cold Runs The River

Cold runs the river
Warm runs my blood
The old signs quiver
And my mind mountain releases a flood

A life nerve in a barren era
Raised in the heat of the sun
I drink its potion from well and caldera
Through earth-veins it flows, forming a canyon

Ice draped rocks, flesh cover bones
The cabals of eternity burn in the night
As the watercourse that rinses all stones
Unify my path with the river site

Cold runs the river
Warm runs my blood

Groundwater recharge, blood pumping heart
Circulation systems refined
Streams of wonder, where my torrent starts
Time and motion aligned

Ice draped rocks, flesh cover bones
The cabals of eternity burn in the night
As the watercourse that rinses all stones
Unify my path with the river site

As the river of time and nature's crown
Face season's last breath and the final exploration

Cold runs the river
Warm runs my blood
The old signs quiver
And my mind mountain releases a flood

As the river of time and nature's crown
Face season's last breath and the final exploration

Ice draped rocks, flesh cover bones
The cabals of eternity burn in the night


4. Panorama

Inner landscapes provide the ground for structures
Development plans, architectural design
nature in it's purest form, the very idea of being alive
Intuitions feeds the progression

Read me, decipher every word
Then multiply the dormant issues
Just tear me down, then build me up again
Accentuate, proliferate, recreate

Vines and trees, new species on cultivated grounds
Planned sequences and astonishing leaps
Everything grows, everything dies
Everything regenerates, slightly altered

Blueprints come in three letter systems
Inside repeats the outside repeats the inside
The distance between what we see and how we see it
A perpetual cycle of adjustments

Read me, decipher every word
Then multiply the dormant issues
Just tear me down, then build me up again
Accentuate, proliferate, recreate

Echoes of what was
Resound in what is
Between organic structures
And inside them


5. When Chaos Calls

Shores retreat in disarray
melting glaciers lead the demise
And connect the rapidly rising tide
A ramming fluid out of firm ice

A wall of waves and an abyss of water
Drench the land, coastal erosion
Submerged by the increasing sea levels slaughter
It stirs our inner ocean

Shores retreat in disarray
Melting glaciers lead the demise
A wall of waves and an abyss of water
Drench the land, coastal erosion

When chaos calls
A drowning of the skyline
A world ruled by horizontal waterfalls
They flood out of pandemonium's shrine

We're buried by persistent snowfall
It levels out topography

When chaos calls
A drowning of the skyline
A world ruled by horizontal waterfalls

No more hinderance for the storm to call
Out, to destruction and catastrophe

Periodic freezing unsettles
Building a kingdom of frost
Chaos dressed in a calm pettle
Set to efface and exhaust

Submerged by the increasing sea levels slaughter
It stirs our inner ocean

When chaos calls
A drowning of the skyline
A world ruled by horizontal waterfalls
When chaos calls
A rift in earth's core
A world ruled by horizontal waterfalls

They flood out of pandemonium's shrine


6. Erodent

The trails of existence thrust into the future
A future that crumbles, riddance by revulsion
Woven roots uphold the ground, earthly bound
The ground we walk, the ground we fought

Rivers drift into eternity, draining the potency
The endless maze, the blinding haze
Shimmering uphold the course
the plains we scour, the plains we tear

Waves that rave the coastal line
Rain that reaps the breeding soil
Wind that pierces the heart of man
The fire that burns all creatures around

The trails of existence, entwined through history
Eras that passed in degenerative haste
Grind the roots, withering grounds
The ground we walked, the ground we fought

Waves that rave the coastal line
Rain that reaps the breeding soil
Wind that pierces the heart of man
The fire that burns all creatures around
The ground we walked, the ground we fought

A past that holds the dawn of man
A march that crumbles stones to sand
The vast exploration, the last ravage
The prodigies of ruination

Erodent
A past that holds the dawn of man
Erodent
A march that crumbles stones to sand
The trails of existence, entwined through history

Waves that rave the coastal line
Rain that reaps the breeding soil
Wind that pierces the heart of man
The fire that burns all creatures around


7. Noctilucent

Deep in the twilight, crystals of water ice
Lightened by a sun that dwells below the view point
Eerie and shining clouds, on darkening skies
As dust and vapor conjoin

Noctilucent


8. Terminus

The boundary is my stronghold
I push the glacier towards the edge
Stepping across the horizon's threshold
With unexplored domain to wedge

I catch the sun and tame the flares
As thunder strikes for a hundred years
A climd the hills, they are my stairs
To the starry sky and to the ardent spheres

Terminus
I catch the sun and tame the flares
Terminus
As thunder strikes for a hundred years

The culmination and the foundation
First man to the end of the world
The gateway and the manifestation
Of the borders I expand, in a storm swirled

Beyond the branches, deep in the sources
I have my home, I have my trust
A climd the hills, they are my stairs
To the starry sky and to the ardent spheres

Terminus
Beyond the branches, deep in the sources
Terminus
I have my home, I have my trust

The elemental outline of the universal courses
First man to the end of the world
While sea and land clash under stellar dust

Raised to seek, grown to see
The flames of creation and prosperity
At the end of the path I build my fortress
With pillars of dreams and nature's primeness


9. Dominant Winds

The hills erode, a change of landmarks
And ancient trees are skinned
Of leaves branches and the outer bark
By an ever blowing wind

Its rule and strength lead the rise and fall
Insects drift along the sweeping regime
At mountainous locations massive rainfall
Still, birds follow their inner scheme

From the polar cyclone
A timeless and transparent grindstone
And by the trade winds of the equator
The air flow builds a subtropical gyrator

The hills erode, a change of landmarks
And ancient trees are skinned
Of leaves branches and the outer bark
By an ever blowing wind

From the polar cyclone
A timeless and transparent grindstone
Pressure is high but the sun angle is low
Dominant winds

Pressure is high but the sun angle is low
Dominant winds scalp the ridge's crest
Cooling and condensation grows
It hauls from the north and heads from east to west

We're strapped in this blusterous maze
Still unaware of its daily toil
We'll get a glimpse of its power and pace
As we're standing on degraded soil

From the polar cyclone
A timeless and transparent grindstone
And by the trade winds of the equator
The air flow builds a subtropical gyrator


1. Thunderous

Up high and far away, where the air is clear
A vast horizon shimmers
The cold wind seems to carry the light away
As the earth's rotation closes the day
Beyond the towering peaks
Recurring shadows bow deep
Into the raging rivers
Beyond the towering peaks
Recurring shadows bow deep
Into the raging rivers
The ground runs cold and hard
Throughout the dark seasons
The ebb and flow of growth and regression
Seasons build, seasons tear down
The northern hammer
Keeps beating, beating
Hear the echoes rumble
Hear the echoes rumble
Beyond the towering peaks
Recurring shadows bow deep
Into the raging rivers
Into the raging rivers
Beyond the towering peaks
Recurring shadows bow deep
Into the raging rivers
The ground runs cold and hard
Throughout the dark seasons
Roots grow deep in order to keep
Clinging to the gusty plains
The wind hushes the earth to sleep
The ebb and flow of growth and regression
Seasons build, seasons tear down
The northern hammer
Keeps beating, beating
Beating, beating
Hear the echoes rumble
Across the thunderous sky
Summers reveal, winters conceal
The thunderous sky oversees it all
Up north and far away, where the air is clear
Vast horizons call
The mighty force of winter
Shapes a merciless scenery
Throughout the dark seasons
Roots grow deep to keep
Earth to sleep


2. Up North

There's a place where the summer will be
As a legend long gone set free
And this warms me beautifully
Where the sun cast shadows at night
Where the day and evenings are bright
The place where I belong
Up north

Where the pine trees meet the sea
Where the stormy sky will sing for me
The place I wanna be
Up north

Fall my favorite season
Death and rain and rain and rain
Falling leaves and fallen stars
As fallen men go back to start
Death as life we hail
Alone but not alone we sail
Death give life and lead the way
All energy remain

Then winter its you and me
The winter is home to the dead alone
With you I'll sleep with ease
Take a moment to reflect and be
Who you are and you are just another icebergs tip at sea
You will melt eventually
And the ocean will rise and the sun crystallize you for the aftermath to see
The spark of true eternity
Clean as a new start set me free
In your wisdom I'm lost what do I know of frost
But I trust you know lost is lost
Winter she is unforgiving as faith

And then spring you will shake
Speed the circle and brake
And create and create and create

And the circle is now complete
No end for an end to meet
Nothing is obsolete
Up north
No end no end for an end to meet


3. The Fire That Burns

The fire that burns
The light that governs the heat
Igniting the passion, the eternal appetite
For things to come
For thoughts to create
The independent nature of man
A creator and destroyer
Deeply rooted, widely spread
The will to strive, the need to push
Fire, fire that burns
Fire, fire that burns
The spark that glimmers
So that visions appear in a flash
The independent nature of man
A creator and destroyer
Deeply rooted, widely spread
The will to strive, the need to push
Fire, fire that burns
Fire, fire that burns
The adventures of the mind
And the conquest of the flesh
That glimmers so that visions appear in a flash
Initiating the chain reaction
Culminating in the very fuel
That drives us on
Independent nature of man
Of man
The will to thrive, the will to leap
Above the highest, the highest peak
The will to thrive, the will to leap
The will to swim
Beneath the deep
Fire
Fire that burns
The adventures of the mind
And the conquest of the flesh


4. Lights

When the dotted lights
Crawl like bugs
On the canvas high above
All I love
And the answer's in my sheets
I forget about tomorrow
And my sorrow
Leave it to the great painter
To open the world and my mind
In the morning light
Leave it to my mind
In the morning light
In the morning light
The air vibrates
With awareness
So now that you see me
A servant in the snow
And now that you hear me
I broke free long ago
I took the world and broke it up
To force it down
I picked the pieces up
And wore them like a crown
And the light shone through forever
And the sky would never hold
And my light shone through forever
And the sky would never hold
So now that you see me
A servant in the snow
And now that you hear me
I broke free long ago
My heroes
They all died so long ago
My heroes
They all died so long ago
To expand on his creation
I took the world and broke it up
To force it down
I picked the pieces up
And wore them like a crown
And the light shone through forever
And the sky would never hold
No, it would never hold
And my light shone through forever
And the sky would never hold
Leave it to the great painter
To open up my mind
And leave it to me
To expand on his creation
My heroes
They all died so long ago
My heroes
They all died so long ago
Freedom exists on a greater scale
Freedom exists


5. Wild Father's Heart

Awakened by a thumping heart growing in his chest
Impulse of generations free sounding in on men
Calling him all ready

To climb the peaks to reach the sun
To rise above

There's a time a time for all
No man's in memory
Eyes are glowing
Life and possibility
Wild father's heart

There is a time a time for all
To rise above

Reason and reverence
Lot of flowing him and knows who follows
Wild father's heart
Driven by natures excellence

Wild father's
Wild father's heart

There is a time a time for all
To rise above


6. Mount Rapture

Mankind's constructed fallacy
Aggressively upheld a reality
Fit for an age without questions
But these constructions of delusion now crumble
A new complexity rises
Violently force themselves
Into stagnant waters of old
As progression descends
Serving us evolution on a plate
Mankind's infancy is over
Our vision is finally clear
Man derives from the great old blue
From mankind's disavowal
Grew confusion, grew delusion
In a haze
From human curiosity and logic
Reason and clarity are born
Fashioned worlds corrode
Bewilderment of old
We've reached the summit
The zenith of our mountain
And the clouds of delusion
Are finally beneath us
Mount rapture crumbles
Stale ignorance implodes
Reality shines through
Mankind's constructed fallacy
Aggressively upheld a reality
Fit for an age without questions
But these constructions of delusions now crumble
Fashioned worlds corrode
Bewilderment of old


7. Into the White

They left it all behind
Crawling through the snow
Every peak a spear piercing the sky
In the twilight glow
Into the blinding white
Swallowed them whole
The freezing wind drained them of all life
Then left them cold
Cold
Life in a flash of red
Pushing the white death
Hear them calling you
Floating in the white
Heat is white and they can not find their way
Back into reason, into their lives
Into the white
Hear them calling you 
Floating in the white
When there's nothing left to save
But an empty shell
You sink into the white
You sink into the white
Into the white
Into the nothingness
White
Into the nothingness
So the winter finally brought them home
Into the white


8. Tidal

The ancient trails ahead
Beat through the barren plains
Wandered by man and beast
Since the dawn of time
Towards the sun, towards the moon
They strode, as do I
To claim our stellar home
Under the dome
We have walked these paths before
We are standing on the shoulders
Of our fathers, of our mothers
And their world of lore
The olden seas bellow
Raging as they beat the shore
Lifting me with a threat into calmer waters
Leading me towards my haven, towards the sands
Our ancient retreat underneath the stars
We sailed the seas before
We reached them through the rivers
Icy waters of the moors
And age-old peaks above
In our chase through the steep ravines
We have sought to see, we have strained to be free
We have charged towards smooth waters
Towards new horizons and our land of old
Under the stellar dome
I have seen these lights before
The moon, the stars
Our place within the lore
We sailed the seas before
We reached them through the rivers
Our place within the lore
I've seen these lights before
We have sailed the seas before
We have reached them through the rivers
Through the icy waters of the moors
And age-old peaks above
The ancient trails ahead
Beat through the barren plains
Wandered by man and beast
Since the dawn of time
We sailed the seas before
We reached them through the rivers
The waters of the moors
And age-old peaks above


9. Voices

There are voices in the air
They always find me - oh they find me
No matter where I go

There are voices in my head
They won't leave me - never leave me
No matter where I go

There are chains now in the field
There's no freedom - no freedom
There's no freedom in the field

There are voices in the air
They always find me in the air
There are voices - oh there are voices
No matter where I go

There are voices in my head
They won't leave me
No matter where I go

And there are chains now in the field
Yes there are chains now in the field
So there's no freedom, no freedom
There's no freedom in the field

There are voices in the air
They always find me oh yes they find me
No matter where I go

I will lay there in the field
Without voices in the air
When I finally draw my last breath
I will lay there in the field

When I finally stop to breathe
When I finally stop to breathe
All the voices, all the voices
Will only linger in the field

1. In The Flames Of Black Art

Coming into the blazing chamber
I am reviewing myself in the flames of black art
I can hear the plaintively singing
of an unknown song of the night
I am divina into the mirrors overfull
With the dark of secrets
I find traces of past decades
I don't want the sun
The night is eternal in me
Like the storms of waterfalls
I am in the flames of black art
My heart didn't stop beating
And my breast isn't icy
But my thoughts are covered with the dark
And my heart has attired the black
Where the night spreads to out the earth
I will go there looking for the night
In the flames of black art


2. Legend?

I saw the tree at the night
Which with his colour was killing
the most sublime feelings in me
And the rain led me
by the furthest corridors of the dreams
To show the pearls of people's minds
To strip the symbols
It was so long ago when the flashes of lighting
Were listening to the scream of the thunder
Staying in an eternal trance i don't cry
Looking at I don't understand the fear
I climb the clouds of mysteries
Finding the relief, finding the lost feelings
Surrounded all around with immensty drops
Esteeming over all the taste of life
It's misteries secrets and moments of trances
I am swimming across impossible to perform confessions
To perish stripped naked among an ugliness of conscience
Finding my shadows which still coincide
In the beginning and the end


3. Secret Garden

Hurry my steeds chased by the wind
Across the crystal meadows
Nobody will hear the piano of melancholy
The music is dancing in my heart
In the midst of the stillness and the storm
When the past closes my feelings in the ice-chains
I will rise the mirror of my visions above the thoughts
To steal merciless the flower of the gods
Which they give away falsely
And the blast of magic and the blackness of sin
Will undermine my scarlet face
When the wind mutter dreadful
You will feel my kiss
When the wind blows into the horns
You will feel the flames of blazing blood
Because only I am the god in my secret garden


4. Inevitable Eclipse

I can see dense hazes
Which cover me with their clouds
I can see dark clouds
Which near inevitable
It is the time to wake up the eclipse
This is the time of inevitable eclipse
Sleeping in torpid weakess
Chined to the burning lake
It will spin the sky with its shadly breath
This is the time of inevitable eclipse


5. The Storm

The storm, that the flames of black art have started
The storm, which has left the symbol of thousand fires
The storm, which gives the thousand minds
The storm, which will thunder forever


6. Seven Golden Fires

Sitting by the candles
Before the mirror of my inspiration
I look at my mirror's picture
So who am I if there stays a mind of an
Inexhaustible mistery with me?
So dance faster with the wind of your shadow
So chase faster in the rain of storm feelings
Drive the chariots of slassy clouds
Looking for the silver groves
And for me the scream of forgotten rain
Where only remains to me to go by the thorns
By the bridges of the past
So I give seven golden fires
So I give seven golden keys
Seven golden fires
Seven golden keys


7. Theatre Of Rapture

Why do you rise me above the clouds
And I hear the voice of my lust
That I hid away from the light
Only desire can be the wind in my dreams
Maybe the wind will find a look in nameless mirror
Maybe the wind will find the inaccessible jewel
I see a bird on the sky,
which steals my longing and takes it away
He it bears sadness and naked sorrow around me
I sail the gold sky above mountains' tops and forests
I sail above eternity
Give me a night, just one more night full of dream
Because when the mourning comes
I will rest for ages on the rocks
Where water and wind dance forever


8. The Dream

Swimming on black wings of winds
I am flying up in a gravely valley of my dream
I am falling in the tub full of blood
I am dreaming about crying portraits
I can not die - this night is so bright
I can not cry - my eyes are so dry
I can not wait - my blood is dying so fast in my black heart
I can not be silent - the sore in my throath is so hot
The scream is burning
The dream about crying portraits


1. Beyond The World

I flew on wings of the night
To find the place beyond the world
And so close I was
And so strong I felt
But only the hand touched
And in forbidden caves I found myself
Looking for the key
To the gate of a place beyond the world
And even nymphs dancing around me
Laughed at my melancholy
This day, this night,
I fly beyond the world
Hanging between the worlds
Sailing in dark air
Towards the place beyond the world


2. In The Opium Of Black Veil

I think that life is not only this touchable, fugitive
Which, though so beautyful, passes away so quickly
You used to stand behind me,
I felt warm touch, heat, passion
I looked back to embrace you
And I saw hot purple, garden in bloom
Woman with a secret flower in hair
Every day with her was a secret unknown for me
And when I saw her scarlet flower in her hair
And a raven in the sky
I thought the raven is only a bad sign
And when you danced among the flowers,
high grass, bloomy meadows
I rised to the sky to blow away stormy clouds
Watching her warming up in imagined flames
I saw as she flew up in the night - as a bird
I fly up into the abbys of the air
And I hear the voice of the woman,
so warm, so close, so painful
I dream you stand behind me
I feel warm touch, heat, passion
I look back to embrace you and I see
Icy blackness, deadly nothing


3. From The Earth To The Stars

Foul weather behind my window
Fatigue on my eyes
I'm so much afraid of this world
That I thought I would do it now
I lay down upon the clouds of pleasure
And sailed through the sea of immensity
Dancing winds were pushing my foggy chariot
And rain was washing away
Remains of daily thoughts from me
In a dream I meditated
And stagnant I sail from the earth to the stars
From the earth to the stars
For there the cold silence washes me
In a moment o the highest illumination
Takes me away beyond reach
Of all the evil hands


4. Ancient Philosophy

Change the mood from joy to sadness
Because sad is the song I sing
On dreams in deep meditations
On seven horses running on the shore at dawn
Born to fly
To fly in the depths of art
To plunge in her captious whirls
To sin by knowing thoughts of god
But I have wasted the dawn
And this is not to be forgiven by any heaven
So look and see I`ll paint a picture
Filled with so many questions and sorrow that divine
But instead of an angel I`ll paint a man
For the paint set so carefully
Would wash away its shapes


5. Secret Garden

Hurry my steeds chased by the wind
Across the crystal meadows
Nobody will hear the piano of melancholy
The music is dancing in my heart
In the midst of the stillness and the storm
When the past closes my feelings in the ice-chains
I will rise the mirror of my visions above the thoughts
To steal merciless the flower of the gods
Which they give away falsely
And the blast of magic and the blackness of sin
Will undermine my scarlet face
When the wind mutter dreadful
You will feel my kiss
When the wind blows into the horns
You will feel the flames of blazing blood
Because only I am the god in my secret garden

1. Into The Abyss Of Forgotten Woods

When a forest dies and hearts are asleep
with unforeseeing fascination
I was there and they were silent
I screamed but they were silent
the trees standing proudly in their white dresses
watching me from the distance
nobody and nothing was able to make them
speak to me and forgive me
one night I met a tree
tired and bleeding
I sit near by I'm listening to her cry
pain so deadly embraced me
and I was united with my thought and spirit
she looked at me in a mournful rapture
she gave me the sign
to carry on with my journey


2. The Longest Journey

Let it be the longest journey
the longest journey of your existence
let's meet on the border of magic
the border of tangibility and fantasy
where the darkness fascinates
where the dark gives no pain
which thought closes the gates?
which thought opens the dreams?
I cross the depths of the crowd
I walk through the depths of the crowd
I can't see you I pass you by
I close my eyes I'm swimming
take me to the unreal world
the most beautiful of my dreams
the longest journey of my existence
I close my eyes
I'm swimming


3. Nameless

Sad melody sounds in my heart
I await endlessly for the non existent pictures
I cannot forget the awakening time
when the heat was burning in my hand
I don't name you because you drown
far from my knowledge but I want to believe
that you exist somewhere beyond the time
again you imprison me when the dusk comes
I know every thought you hide
I cannot believe in the words of goodbye
when the heat was burning in my hand
they roar like the waves leaden by the inspiration
I reveal all secrets but again you leave
when the dawn comes I tear the golden dreams
where no one dreamed of real dreams
I can remeber the roar of the waves
and the roar of the storm
I wanted to keep the fragile moment
but looking for freedom
I picked up the flower of longing


4. Beauty

Unseen far beyond the reach of my hands
slightly noticed on the border of my thoughts
but I can see you with the eyes of my imagination
I know the taste and smell of your body
smell of your body
pleasure of your body
I'm listening to the sound of your call
I'm standing naked in front of the perfect thought
I'm looking for you with all my heart
the sensible journey into the pleasure of your body
your smell unleashes my senses
your taste makes my heart wild
your passion embraces
your look gives me splendour
I'm dying once more that night
I die every night


5. Time

The time is not my ally
I swing at the edge of the words
I await eternally
the moment I have dreamed of
temptation of elements
neverending is so great
they are passing too fast
darkness, light, night, day
I am the ray but time is the light
when will my heart feel the wind
who knows the taste of freedom
who knows the taste of calm
I must fly above reality
I must fly above the real
the wandering is not my karma
let's meet at the other side


6. Moon Has Imprisoned Me In Her Shine

I travel to find some calm
and every night I'm lost between
the flowers of my garden
and every night you run away
from me into the dark
I can see you
I can see you so close
you burn the flames you burn the heat
I melt the ice I shall be close so soon
the mask of ice is loosing greatful power
I'm next to you again so close
moon has imprisoned me in her shine
I follow the voice of my heart
lunatics never die
during the day I dream so beautifully as at night
during the day I think so dense as at night
during the day I picture you so much as at night
during the day I look for you so intense as at night


7. When the Dreams Died

At night I swim the dark depths
so hard so much of it
oceans drown feelings somewhere
time is not a friend
hearts got empty and don't remember
I cannot fly anymore
the dreamed lands remain far from here
mysterious and unknowing
I can understand so much
I remember only one moment
when the dreams died
and when they left only heavens wept
from the clouds with rain
the thoughts have fallen down
the dreams have fallen down
no way leads to the stars now
no thought will ever enrapture
I dissapear in darkness
no thinking of words of freedom
everything I forgot somewhere


8. Elegy

I can see you in my dreams
you run away from me
I miss the time we did not have
but the rain keeps washing my sadness away
I know you'll still be in my mind
I know you'll still be in my heart
I close myself in my castle
never to come out
to give vent to my evil thoughts
to remain there in shadows in forgetfullness
I wander looking for the time
I am dreaming of
I make circles around old places
I discover things
I know you'll still be in my mind
I know you'll still be in my heart


9. Soporific

Dream through eternity
let it be the eternal journey
without the end


2. In Red Iris

Second two or maybe a day
I glance over yellowed pages
Touch the scares of your unpure soul
I drown in sticky passion of your memory

Born from chaos wind of hatred human faces it posses
The sand of the sarcophagus of memories blows
And every seed is a diamond blade

In the tact of their language beats my heart
And pass centuries

I touch the scares of your unpure soul
Sometimes death comes at night
Sometimes death is silence
Sometimes death scares the wind
Sometimes death gives birth to the dark

Let the show go on

I touch the scars of your unpure soul
In red iris daylight dies
Nothing shall escape from me

Sometimes death is filled with the blood
Sometimes death fades away in fog
Sometimes death il like a black storm
Sometimes death scares the wind of life
Sometimes death comes to you at night
Sometimes death gives birth to the dark

I touch the scars of your unpure soul
Sometimes death is filled with blood
Sometimes death fades away in fog
Sometimes death is like a black storm
Sometimes death has many names


3. Era Aggression

This anger which direct a fist to somebody's face
This fire which changes the matter into dust
This hate which is poison of the blood
This madness which controls the mind

I take out a knife to give it to others

I swim into rusted irony
I wear the coat of hypocrisy
Dull mind sends misty waves of noise
Shorter and shorter is the thread on the spool of time

I take out a knife to give it to others
Like an echo repeat curses
One of the wingless creatures


4. Time Of Obscure Emotions

We ride through the secrets
Half gods - that's what we are
Half human without feelings
Far from the stars we are
With suffering and pain
We live insane and blind
We spill the sand on ourselves
For it is the only truth about us

Rush of the wind runs insane storm
Blackness comes out of infinite bowls
Drawing the word
Eye looks inside the stone
Dreams disturbed by deadly silence
Whispers rises from your cold srceams

Sadness formed into drops above the sky
Creates another poems every night

They will look and not believe
They will yell they will deny
I will burn the bridges and respect
And me the blind bat
I shall love my black disguisting wings
In an infinite cave I shall live
Always looking downwords
Always looking downwords

We ride through the universe
Far from the stars we are
With suffering and pain
We live insane

With suffering and pain
We live insane and blind
We spill the sand on ourselves
For it is the only truth about us

We fallow blindly emptiness
We bury our essence
In ahshes and fire
We fallow emptiness


5. Fistful Of Ashes

So the eyes of fire phantom created from awesome magic

I have hatred that flies high on the dusk's wings
I have scarlet cloak that protects me from the light
I have misty phantoms in a white incense smoke
I have temptations driven away from god's garden

From this stone that touches my consciousness I shall make a fistul of ashes

I have immortal might that bursts so rapidly
I have madness that caresses mind and body
I have memories that burn with their redness
I have dreams that burn with no relief

Madness memories dreams
Hatred memories dreams

From this flame that burned for me into the night
I shall vanish
From the passion I shall vanish from the passion
From the passion from the passion from the passion

I have awareness that distorts my face deriding
I have uncalmed sorrow in endless complaint
I have grief in silent cry of universe
I have curse that kills with icy dagger


6. Demise

Under the fog night raises curtains
I feel it pulsates in my blood
As the grey light comes down from the clouds
Victoriously I raise my head high

Thunders and winds

I look with undisguised disguist
At empty souls around me
I hear them laughing in a mardled house
It echoes on an adorned vault
I want to unleash my burning hatred
That flies on dragon's wind looking for fulfilment

No thought can reveal the meaning of the words
Only thunders and winds are the melody
That can bring peace to my soul

Empty souls
Thunders and winds
Night raises curtains
Burning hatred
Night raises curtains
In a proud silence

While inside my soul there are funerals
Without orchestras
Silently attacking my scared heart
I feel no mercy, I feel no forgivness


7. Absence Of Light

Only the plants without eyes survived
I lost you among them

Alone I am stepping through a path full of missed thorns
Only I can carry the flag of people's sorrows
If only nobody crosses the border of madness and life
Since not only I am the life,
For beyond there are also pain and faith
No one can think for us

We were in the garden full of figures
Made of glass, they were melting our hands in springs

I wanted to be among the men
But I saw them rotten plants without eyes
Figures seemed to be officious in despair
I wanted to be among the mes
But I saw them rotten plants without eyes
My fear was full of passion

I stopped my tears
For there was too much rain
And the figures seemed to be officious in despair

We are only pale shadow
On the coloured surface of the starry sky
And no one but us clean up memories
In dreams they seem black
All of us want to forget about what makes us evil

Rains of life were falling from the fountains
Taste of blissful grapes spoiled by dogs
Lying at crossroads

I stoped my tears for there was too much rain
And the figures seemed to be officious in despair

Glass rains fountains springs life evil
Shadow dark light sorrow cry glass death


8. The Darkest One

I teach you the gift of darkness
For you could know the unknown
Fou you could keep the secret
Which is the greatest of all

When you become the part of darkness
You will understand the untold
And your light in the sky
Will blink and hide in you

Darkest tear falls
Shedding goblet of bitterness
Free me from the pain of life
And you pass me in the arms of death
Crying of beauty of the night

I show you the gift of darkness
Crying of beauty of the night
You pass me in the arms of death
Free me from the pain of life
When you become the part of darkness
You will understand the untold
And your light in the sky
Will blink and hide in you


9. Dusk

Shining in a mistic dusk of one lightning
I will awake the sleeping in the sun covered with heat

In a mourning of life, majestic in pain
In air still rising they go deeper and deeper

Eyes of fire in the black horizon rise with rays

Sand-glass goes on torturing without hope
In a deadly silence souls rest in a shadow
Its jealousy does not hide any secrets
I put fires that echoes in horizon
They howl hungry sending their despair voices up to heaven
I will not control my passion

I will struggle to bring them up to the sky
I will struggle for them to burn in their beauty
I will struggle for them to be a thorn in a crown of light
I will struggle for them to burn in their beauty
I will struggle for them to be a thorn in a crown of light
I will struggle to bring them up to the sky

They howl hungry sending their despair voices up to heaven
I will not control my passion to give life to all senses


10. From Beyond

Swinged I am wearing feathers
Dance tangled thoughts go mad
Swinged I am thought to fly
Whirl fall and come back again

The wind that dances on stormy sky
And rainy silver mist
Flash in deep eyes of the stars
The taste of night which spread her spell

For now when I'm gone I really do exist

All this takes me high above the earth
All this makes me breathe
All this makes me change my mind
And closer to me will get when I close my eyes

He looks so different I am calm
I get rid of my shame I don't hide my eyes
And I speak nothing in return radiate
I melt in difference
He knows I feel

Swinged I am shown the path
Watch do not think follow
Swinged I am caress of madness
Get might skills and will


11. In Its Cobweb

Here I wait for you
Born from darkness

In your coldness
In your absence
In your cobweb
In your darkness

Coldness
Absence
Cobweb
Darkness

Here I wait for you

1. Vampiric Prose

Petrified with icy fear
You're waiting for the only ray,
The sign, the rebirth
And every night you mourn in lament
Let my hungry lips close to your neck
For I tell the cooling blood to run fast
Because I am the One

More and more I am filled
With eternal criminal lust

I am the one who is the Night
I am the one who lives with your blood
I am the one above mortality
I am the one - you are the key

And I feel pleasure
A little dizziness
Tiredness, coldness
Extreme excitement

Now I am your moon,
Your stars, your sunrise
We are listening to the music
From within the silence


2. Hallucinations

Hail black mushrooms clouds
Hail ladies of paganism
Hail Devil's servant
Hail Master of ceremonies

Secrets of Black Art...

Hallucinations...

Black Art - a direct appeal to the spirits

Fire through your veins
Dismal bliss inside
Overtakes me
Darkens my eyes - to see...

While they dance to the accompaniment
Of barbarous hearts with more than real
Hallucinations
I cross the deepest river of my consciousness


3. The Burning Times

Trials tortures executions
Fire gender extermination

Collective hysterics, crazes
Mass murder and panics
Witch - hunts resulted in trials and tortures and executions

Ill - fated heroines exterminated by the holy deadly institution
Mere victims of narrow-minded prejudice
And fanatical judgment (mass murder)
Scapegoats on which every imaginary blame can be laid

For male - dominated Christian society
Women were anathematized and cast as witches
Because of enduring grotesque fears they generated
In respect of their presume abilities to control men

Witchcraft was one expression
Of the constant effort of the race
To rid itself of the sick religion imposed on it


4. Letter From Hell

My beloved daughter
Innocent have I come into prison
Innocent have I been tortured
Innocent must I die

They said: "You are a witch! Will you confess it voluntarily?
If not, we will bring in witnesses and executioner for you!"
You are a witch
You are a witch
You are a witch...

The executioner put the thumb-screws on me,
Both hands bound together, so the blood ran out at the nails
And everywhere, so that for 4 weeks I could not use my hands,
As you can see from the writing.
Thereafter they stripped me, shaved me all over,
Bound my hands behind me and drew me up in the torture.

Then one said: "Invent something,
For you cannot endure the torture you will be put to.
One torture will follow another until you say you are a witch.
Not before that will they stop."

Am I a witch? Yes, I am a wicked woman turned aside to Satan, seduced by demons.
I pass over great spaces of the earth during the nights,
Obeying commands of my mistress Diana.

My beloved daughter, goodnight, for your mother will never see you more.

5. Blackward

In the name of hatecraft
In the name of their blood
In the name of the night
In the name...

Look inside the executioner's hood
I feel no mercy but I will let you meet him well
Come with me upon the scaffold
I will show you his grimace
Hard to read and understand

Come with me upon the scaffold
I will lead you through the horror
Look inside executioner's hood
I will show you his grimace

You can not hide from me

A shocking and blasphemous vision
Making sick with smell of blood

I am the blasphemy stealing your freedom
I insult and I hate
I arouse fear and prayers
Nobody dares to look into my eyes

Whose face has the executioner?

Come with me upon the scaffold
I will lead you through the horror
Look inside executioner's hood
I will show you his grimace


6. Recurring Yell

Can you hear these voices?
Dark brown dresses around me
Can you hear these whispers?
Fear inside me
Can you feel this bitterness?

Rapid mountain rivers
Floating stories down the world

Voices are rising from the earth
Screaming for revenge
Up in the skies
Run by the wind
Just one more time they set the fire
I open wounds not healed for ages
In anger I stand
Dripping with blood and burning
Secret paths high up and down

Their lots floating on mountain rivers
Faster faster down the world
Are you aware of that?

The Carpathian Forests have seen it all
Keeping every pain
Drinking blood with ancient roots
Swinging in meditation
They feed us with the air heavy of memories
Heavy of slaughters, murders, lynches and agonies


7. Labyrinth Of Anxiety

Unholy land greets her with fog and death
The further the worse - anxiety whispers
More subtle than scent the sense of hunting is
In a labyrinth of crashed memories
Memory dances among the ashes
Fear and horror biting deep

Anxiety whispers Anxiety screams

Fear and horror biting deep
Pyres burning, sword is cutting
Painful pleasures lick with their tongues

Out from here comes evil
Out from here gushes blood
Out from here sips poison
Out from here pain and suffering

The only just ones screamed in savage madness
False prophets with love offered pain
Prayers bringing an overwhelming fear
Meticulous intrigues, ignorance and humiliation

Inculcated hatred against everything about the magic
Soaking through every world
Trapped waves hitting the ruins
But there is always someone for the dark wisdom to survive


8. Virus

I lay down, my breathing slow
Poisonous plant running up and down my body
I breathe in the fumes of wild herbs
All alone in the night
Stars are staring, rain is drumming
Something is calling me
I want to know I have to know I want to know
All alone in the night
Something is calling me

Visions enter the gate of my eyes like an old friend
With the knife my wrist will dance awhile
And it is so good and I do not care anymore
Stepping into an unknown world
Invisible scar
All alone in the night
I want to know I have to know
All alone in the night
My breathing slow

I lay down my breathing slow
Stars are staring, rain is drumming
Something is calling me
I want to know I have to know
All alone in the night
All alone in the night
And it is so good
Something is calling me
My breathing slow
My breathing slows...


9. Old Form Of Worship

Fight Fight Fight Fight!
Souls in revolt on your side!
Fight Fight Fight Fight!
You are the one to decide!

Howling of wild dogs
Initiation into the craft

You will get your heart's desire

From now onwards!
My own diviner
Zealously overlooking with the Evil Eye


10. Tempted By Rot

The scent of dark red death
Summoned from the land beyond the time
You light the lusts on the altar of darkness
Sinister mistress of crime

I feel like you and this is so elitist
I feel I can do anything
I feel I transcend humanity

I feel I am becoming a murderer
Possessed by obsession
Overwhelmed by the lust to revenge
I stand in thy adoration

Possessed by sick obsessions
I stand in my adoration
I feel I can do anything
I am becoming my own murderer

My soul rides between the worlds
I will give my life to death
That is the temptation! That is the temptation!

I feel like you and this is so elitist
I feel I can do anything
I feel I transcend humanity

Who, having fertilized Death, his beloved one,
Would look at her face willing to find the horror
Fear and blasphemy dwell in darkness
I dance with Death willing to keep life
Willing to keep life I dance with Death


11. Tribute To...

Tied to a post and with brutality of the period- burned
Fastened upon a hurdle and drawn at the horse's tail
Through mud an mire
Ceremoniously hanged and then quarted
Forced to confess untruth
Put to the torture
Mentally raped
Thousands of women committed to the flames

Better an end in horror than horror without end!


1. False Sleepwalker

In the dark you head towards the crossroads
Where the wind blows without restraint
Cold and soulless like a wax figure
At times rising over the clouds
You won't get here in the daytime,
You won't see anything in the light of day
The gale is flapping its iron wing
Staring inside with its eyes like two abyssal vaults
The armoured heart won't break, it'll just fall into the gulf of feelings

Hundreds of nights, hundreds of days
All mercilessly sad
All cruelly lonely
All pervaded with gloom
All marked with pain

Over at the sky that never ever dawns
Fell clouds of pallid spectres spellbinding shadows bleak
Eyes so dark that you need to turn away lest you fall into the void
Murk seeps in every night, of blackness made, in coldness carved
A swarm of morbid phantasms is teeming in your thoughts
Their deathly hands upon your brow
The sleepless flock pushing at you
Leering at you

Hundreds of nights, hundreds of days


2. Vote For Heresy

The world is turning to ashes when faith triumphs
The faith of those convinced they believe in nothing
You conceal your dark soul and your filthy thoughts
That spectre of naivety that burns in your eyes
Tears the fabric of noble ideas
Overwhelmed by gloom you head towards the nameless void
Your doom dwelling in this deserted city
Has become its dungeon

The age of magic when you struggle with the waves of darkness
Enfolds you with a haze of sin
The moaning of the condemned reverberates within you
You abandon those silver shrines
They want to shroud your mind with the veil of their black wings
In the grip of death you renounced your god
And arose as a heretic
That is how infinity awakens

I've ceased to believe in false miracles
Vote for heresy
In flames I'm descending into the shades of death
Vote for heresy
I'm spreading the wings of my wicked plan
Vote for heresy
Hidden from the human sight in a cloud of black mist


3. Final Conjuration

All numb, you look around
Your soul does not struggle anymore
Everything makes you suffer
Dark clouds gathering over you again
Unstained with the sign of the cross
You can't dispel these thoughts lashing you with the fire of contempt

I will be in your dreams till the very end
Your blood's so precious to me
You will leave the chronicle of your anguish
Looking forward to the final night of doom
I'm taking your hand in this deathly silence
Your journey brings you closer to the secrets of death

The moon enters the cave of the dead
Snakes tense in their sleep
You debase yourself begging for the last spell

The grave will hide your deathly pallor and abomination

All numb, you look around

4. Pain Collector

Followed by a nauseating metallic stench
Of wounds and death
Stigmatized with the rust of clotted blood
Filled with the strength of his arrogance and hate
He destroys everything
Possessed with rage
Overwhelmed by wrath
He burns all words
All memories
Here comes real impurity
Cursing you and the world

The pain collector
He gained the gift of suffering
The pain collector
Those bloodshot eyes stare in the dark
The pain collector
Asking after the sinister omen
The pain collector
Filled with painful stigmas of death

Tears flow all night long
The sombre mourners carry a soulless flame
The corridors vibrate with a sinister melody
Reverberating with a sepulchral echo
Broken heart intoxicated with agony
Pierced with a black lightening
The sobbing of ominous songs
Accompanied by a cold bell tolling


5. Gloria Inferni

All the darkest dreams came true
She closed her eyes forever
The bride so calm and pale and sad
Here's the agony she'd suffered

I was lead through a monumental hall
When a blow blinded me and I lost my way
Her ghastly face shrouded in a cloak
Six wings bleeding into six ebony cups
De Profundis – the trembling out of the depths
This infinite flame that crumbled her heart
Dribbling its dark venom

She said: gloria inferni

A shining dagger cutting through my breath
She collected my blood in a stone chalice
Licking the blade with a wicked face
Suddenly encircled by a dreary cortege
Consciousness fades away, conscience withers away
A cold trance spreads

It's dusk already, but haunted by nocturnal demons...


6. Solfernus' Path

His numb fingers clenched around infamy
The blurry transparencies of misty dreams
Washed his atrocious soul
Praised for his vaulting pride and sinister hubris

Betrothed to a doomed song of darkness stronger than god himself
He disavowed his soul for ages
Hoisted the sails when the storm started its mournful lament
He stepped forward, silent, lightnings in his eyes

The sons of men on the brink of death
How much they suffered looking at his mysterious glare
And the heavens in their eyes faded, the day darkened
The shadow swelling casting its black wing

Like the flame fluttering in the wind
Panting with bitterness
Entombed in a smoking urn
He descended into the dark abyss of spectres

Dimmed are the sepulchral candles
With a cunning gesture of his crooked hands
Immune to the stare of those piercing eyes
The king of chaos merges into gloom


7. Lunar Silhouette


8. King Of Burning Anthems

I am the still darkness of stars
I am the shadow of a flickering flame
I am the mournful moaning of wind
I am the sigh of a tomb of silence
I am the cold eternity of the sea
I am the blood-stained dagger of the hearts

Here I am, the bell that plagues the conscience
Overwhelmed by the pale abyss
Here I am, the gloomy temple of my soul
That will never let you forget
Here I am, frozen into a gem of wisdom
That petrifies with fear
Here I am, the anthem of shadow
That reverberates with a distant resonance
Here I am, the chariot running blindly to a certain death
As merciless as the grave
Here I am, the prophet of haunting infinity
That pervades from all sides

I am the bright flame amidst the gale
I illuminate mountain murk with the glow of dawn
I am the ember of my pain, the star of my power
I am the thunder of the storm louder than eternity
I am the dust of desert scratching bloodstained tombs

I am the abyss of volcanoes spouting venom


9. Chimera

Remnants of human consciousness in you
Polish your rage
You'd give it away without regret
All the stars let you down
Your lost paradise is fading
The wailing of false prophecies
Leading your straight into those ice-cold arms

Fear lurks in the dark
You'll all shrouded in it
I'll take you up into a vortex
I'll carry you away into the endless starry space
You can't see my veiled face
Anxiously clasping the clammy hand

The sign of blood imprinted on your arm
Will make you follow my way
You'll open your eyes to the cravings you'd never known
You'll be the witness of agony
Everything will change
Your eyesight hearing smell will sharpen

The pain will make you want become one of us


10. A Mesmeric Séance

Say farewell to a fading beam
This leaden mist has frozen still
The spectre's petrified into gloomy haze
Shrouding mystery that you revolt against
An end to your dreams of absolute power
Only spellbound stupor in the waking hour
Those opiate vapours of oblivion you inhale
Hush your dazed conscience wearing it away

My memory thrown down into the abyss
All my secrets entrusted into your clenched fists
My curiosity dazed with this mesmerizing glitter
When the pillars of cognition succumb and wither

Your soul aroused by a sudden flare
Or is it wind howling out in the air?
Is there someone still crying and calling my name?
Or is it rain sobbing, moaning out in the gale?
Is this just an illusion or can I really hear
This nocturnal howling of sinister wail
Can I see shadows dancing in the moonlight rays
Or are these pale figures swarming in mortal embrace?


3. Night Of Sacred Wisdom

Can you smell it in the air
Smoke is rising, fog of revenge
A wounded warrior is crawling back
An arrow in his chest

He is bleeding, death is near
Ravens watch him oh so close
Dying proud with honor in fight
Under creed of a heathen free man

Down his trail their houses are burning
Even children beheaded in hate
His heart is still with old gods
He knows the burning burial awaits

Tribe will mourn the passing of a kin
Soul by soul with thoughts to avenge
Sign of wolf branded in belief
Hail the victory and iron will

Times await their emended return
Though of old the weapons changed
Marching on still with pagan faith
And with intent to fulfill revenge

We are encouraged by blood
By the battle spirit
None can bring silence today
For tongue of vengeance speak


4. Dark Fortress

Fires burn yet again
Fed with corpses of the men
Who opposed us and never will be free
They still live for only flames to see

And the old gas chambers
Destroy human life again
Pestilent weak people
Grimly rid with Zyklon-B

You will work force labor
For our engines of war
As the fodder to feed with
To be reaped with war

God's race feeds our cause
Such an irony within
Grim Northern funeral winds
Blow again over lands

No mercy will be shown
Panzer march, panzer march
Iron tyranny and hate
Conqueror fire and supreme art

Dark fortress of SARGEIST
Soon stands rising proud
Nation's flag upon the walls
Cross of blue on white

Reshape the fallen dignity
Of a mighty northern race
We are the first of cruelty
Beating on humanity's face


5. Scion Of Glory And Pride

We can smell the blood
Among the leaves and branches
Taste the old forest breath
So hateful and pagan in tongue

We are brought to a place
Sacred among our race
Old gods watch our fight
Strength and glory at our side

The blood is still calling
Wakes an instinct of wolves
Hate in our blue eyes
Pride of the alpha supreme

The strong race is coming
End of all Jehovah’s life
We must write again with blood
Write the nature's laws

Soon our throne is built again
Made of Christian skulls
The culture of mighty nation
Is brought to life again

Our beliefs in the ancient gods
The sorceries are binding us
With the victory and sign of the sun
Magick strengthening our creed

Our people, listen to the wolf
Deep inside your soul it speak
Honor, blood and cult of heathen man
A white wolf of highest order

We are cavalry with the might mares
Young and strong, full of pride
Strike with hate in our blue eyes
Iron tyranny returns


7. The Impaler Prince

Vlad the third, the Impaler Prince
Wallachain lord of sins
Born in 1431 in Sighisoara

The year was same his father became
A part of the Dragon Order
Thus the name Dracul - the devil
The dragon of evil and hate

Years had passed and he was taught
The art of war and noble ways
He had the Faragas and Almas dutches on his days

Destiny gave him not more than six years on the throne
Still he ruled with tyranny and mercy was not shown
He loved to set a banquet up and watch the people die
Old and young and children tortured under Dracul's eye

Armies of the Turkish fled with fear burnt in their hearts
Terror spread where corpses hung and where the rotting starts
On mountains near the River Arges he had meant to be
But on this sorrow-guided trail became his misery

Betrayed by no one but his brother - he did flee
His wife had thrown herself to death for brother's men to see
For years he was a captive in the court of Hunyadi
Then he came to pay revenge and set a reign to be

Vlad the third, Impaler Prince
Wallachain lord of sins
Born in 1431 in Sighisoara
In the end he dies in battle, how, remain unknown
The year of 1476 death was his own


8. Sinister Glow Of The Funeral Torches

March to the black holocaust has begun
Funeral tones echo over all the land
The rebirth of a satanic empire of death
Without the human Christian millions of weak

Black pure imperial blood
Herited from funeral sworn
In the soil where rotting bones were placed
Our souls grew and from the curse were born

We are not human though human appears outside
Maybe human destiny awaits for this flesh
We are the face of your timeless death
A circle made of sinister, morbid intentions

The strong race is coming to end all life
The creature of god, the larva of feebleness
Of such monumental hate darkness will rise again
Bestial offering of human blood 
final nail to the coffin of god

In the endless night to come
Roaring hell of Black Metal
Sinister light of the funeral torches
You'll see it before a sword


9. Sworn By The White Wolves Blood

The end belongs to none but you
Created from dust and empty souls
You'll soon return to the void
A destiny worth of nothing
You all nasty creatures of god
Will regret you ever lived
You the Nazarene, bastard crowned
You shall feel the spear once more

Our kingdom - the night
Everlasting - when humanity ends
For the glory of Satan

And all human your father made
Oh, we'll laugh at their ashes grey
Until the winds from the sea blow it away
In the dark war, endlessly

The moon, the cries of wolves
The ancient times
Only night brings a feeling
To this human body of mine
Nothing in common with life
Only death is REAL


10. Iron, Blood And Blasphemy

Your song will echo ever long
Burnt with pride into our heart
With honor marked on our souls

Your blue eyes are the thousand lakes
Our banner white and blue
You are clad in white of the winter
Beauty of the north so true
And the nights of summer they are bright
With endless sun among the stars
And forests vast and cruel
Breathe the culture of our race

We are from the Cavalry Town
Once with name Lapwestrandh
Once again we will return
Regain the pagan past
Every flag will celebrate our sign
Iron sun wheel of the gods
We will rid the land of the plague
Burn the churches to the ground

Comradeship through iron and blood
We unite in sacred war
Our hearts forged unto battle
Thirsting for the victory
There is nothing stopping our march
Black holocaust funeral march
With blood and honor, iron and blasphemy


2. Satanic Black Devotion

Hear the chant of my tormented soul
In black devotion I have prayed
Veins re-opened, bleeding for Satan
With pride my flesh is cut

Obscurities unveil to me 
a Disciple

In worship I rape humanity
Idolizing the torment with scars
I burn His sign into my heart
Preces infandus- possess me

I am the sick and devoted fanatic
My appearance is foul
In your fear you will avoid hurting me
Even in my name I carry rotting omens


3. Obire Pestis

This morbid night melancholy
Moon of funeral broods
Mist rising from the swamps
Where superstitions are alive
Frogs and crickets please me
Though not long will my ears hear
Not long will I howl at the moon
The end already creeps on my tongue
Between old suffering trees
I still see that which reminded me
Of a time sorrow had reigned

With hope crushed underneath
A regent to the throne of black memory
Lost, forgotten and waiting for Hell
Asking why I left at all
Where are my weapons and dreams

There is no death to save me
I have never lived
Morbid night melancholy


4. Frowning, Existing

I stand alone
Waiting for my thoughts
Alone among
Shattered visions, waiting
Eternally, watching:

Depressed they attempt mockery
Failure. Ceasing of heartbeats
End of pointless days
Thoughts infiltrate the voids
Of oblivion

Hollow joy, artificial happiness
Broadcasted daily, and pitifully
Raising futile fists

Darkness marauds
The excruciating populations
Perplexingly shallow
Appears abstract through eyes

Familiar to none else
Satan reaches deep within
My brain is shrouded in lava
Piercing and burning
Searing my past


5. Glorification

On this night of a depressive autumn
Under branches of these old trees
On this hour thy sign I glorify
Black flame of Satan in my heart
Fog is rising from the murky waters
Carrying the stench of the swamp
An owl is hooting, sounding afar
As melancholy takes a grip

I drink the blood of a virgin child
From an old golden flask
In my mind the Countess of Cachtice
And the memory of terror she spread
Bitter words utter from my lips
Incantations of reincarnation
With the blood thy sign I glorify
Waking instincts of a wolf

I am finding strength in the hate
Misanthropic burning wounds
As much as I hate the human pigs
So I hate the flesh of my own


6. Panzergod

So many names have been given to me
For what the humans fear is versatile
I was born under the yoke of Evil
An armoured fist of Satan

Yes, fear me in the howls of wolves
Fear me in the pale moon itself
Where my presence is near
Your soul will coil with ulcers
Like a cancer of hate and Evil
I will reach for the universe
Infecting every church with darkness
Ceremony echoes to me

In my devotion I am His weapon
Pointed at your feebleness
Throats I slit and drink the blood
From a chalice made of a skull
Beat the drums of a satanic march
With the human bones
Let be heard even in the wind
Satan is too strong
You will stand but a little chance
Face the death eternal
Spilling blood of the holy martyrs

Glory of the sacred war
In my devotion I am his prophet
Slashing curses on the skin
Taste the poetry of my tormented skin
It's the last thing you'll know


7. Black Fucking Murder

For me its natural to feel
Nothing but hate and contempt
Surrounded by humans
Pathetic and weak
They have blindfolded my heart
With ugly flesh and faith
In my soul the black worms nest
Soon to cocoon, to born as bats as Satan

Black fucking murder
Ejaculation of death
Black fucking murder
Burning lead my breath

You buried me ages ago
Yet too soon for you I was awake
The plague and scourge of mankind
The black prophet of death
Where I walk I wish you Hell
In my appearance, words and my deeds
I put the zenith to its limit
Ride the carnage of souls
Hear the sermon of worship in black
I write and claim in priests' blood
I have sinned to be the betrayer
Judas of year two thousand and two


8. Sargeist

Tears wet the coffin dust
Mourning stains the wooden lid
Through the sadness and depression
I awake in the stone cold grave
Weird glow in the vault around me

A sense of freezing atmosphere
A coffin spirit of past remembrance
Howling at the moon in my memories
All around the cobwebs are silent
Even spiders have died so long ago
Void of life in hear is so definite
I exist but not to live again

In my death the omens were profound
Tongues that uttered curse and doom
Born under the Master's spell
Hungry for the warmth that I would spit on
Tears wet the coffin dust
Mourning stains the wooden lid
Through the sadness and depression
I awake in the stone cold grave
There is no life, no humanity
Nothing to keep me from suffering
Nothing to feed my burning soul with
Nothing to spill my hate upon


9. Returning To Misery and Comfort

I hate the moon and its glow
For it no longer pleases me
I curse the winter and its snow
For it will lead "them" to me
Returning to the Darkness
Of the mountain caves
Following the voice of the past
When sky is obscured with clouds

Even starlight seems miserable
Fragile memories hurt my mind
Into everlasting misanthropy
Cold and depressive
One with the old dead forest

Before I leave this place
Nothing left to comfort me
But the cold touch of steel

1. Black Treasures Of Melancholy

I have watched over thousand deaths.
Possessed the mourning families.
I have felt their tears of grief.
Flown on my face under their skin

I am the entity that feeds the sadness.
Depression and melancholy.
I am a demon who's wings are nets.
Catching every tear that you cry.

The salt in your wounds is like alcohol to me.
Drunken I've been so many times.
I still remember the age of Black Death
The years I was feasting so long.

Now that I look at the pathetic world
I despise the humans since day one.
Invisible the shadows that haunts infernally.
I am there when you are hurt in pain.


2. Remains Of An Unholy Past

Once again my thoughts-are drifting back in time.
Remembering the times-when the cult was one.
Black metal nowadays-is too much just a game.
But in my heart prevail-the age of black metal reign.

As the shadows rise-echoes from the past.
We are the Satan's legion-devoted to his crimes.
Nothing ever will be the same-returin to the Night.
The curse has not been lifted-its stronger than the passing time.

Black metal is a spell-of misanthropic light.
Burning in my eyes-disciple of the Heinous Path.
In the glare of burning churches-a dedication monument.
Unholy black remains-worshippers of the cult.

Black metal fucking war-satanic possession
To Satan,forever-under the funeral moon.
We are an evil blaze-eternal in the northern sky.
It's the time of Sabbath-return of hell and tyranny.

Remembering the times-murders and the arsons.
The flame is in my heart-the oath and covenant
Darkness of the past-the calling of devotion
Following the freezing moon-into the deepest Night.


3. Cursed Blaze Of Rituals

Born a night from a rotten womb.
Breath of terrible mournful past.
Fear and misery of the peoples memories
Waiting for the coffin lid to open.

With a Chalice raised to the Majesty
I'm his disciple and devotee.
I am the fist of Satan clenched
In rapture by the worship

Cursed blaze of rituals
The sinister black catharsis
Remembering the unholy chants.
As I scratch the wooden lid.

I'm the melancholic lord of torment.
The remains of a ruined soul.
Evil presence from an Empires doom
The raven at your funerals

Under the full moon
Tormented howling winds
Born a Night from a rotten womb
Breath of terrible mournful past.


4. Disciple Of The Heinous Path

Secrets born in me are the conjurations
Malicious mysteries-calling of the blood.
Morbid esoteries written on human skins.
Unfit for a world like this-a place of suffering.

Disciple of the Heinous Path
The covenant of pestilence
I am a soldier,a fanatic.
With a heart sworn to the Dark Lord.

My flesh is the abode of complex entities
A temple and a grave-a Chalice of His wrath
The candlelight is pouring down from a flickering flame.
Pure black energy and obscurity

The rapture of my murder.
These dark tormenting desires.
Perversion-tyranny.
Disciple of the Heinous Path


5. Heretic Iron Will

Blessed are those who know and face sorrow.
Thus who experience a life of constant overcoming.
Strength to be blended with pain
On the heretic path,iron will prevails.

To rise and survive
In this world object and rotting.
Darkness means the highest knowledge.
On the heretic path,iron will prevails.

Breed of Satan
Noble and solitary
Blazing spirit and heart unbleeding.
Eternally denying,defying and conquering.

Command to the eternal circle
Strike with the spear of Satan
Instincts and strife for excellence are always at one.
To celebrate the sinister dawn.


6. Echoes From A Morbid Night

Out in the night I am the storm
I am the winds that slash your flesh.
Obscure writings cut on your ugly skin.
Drug-crazed of my magnificent power.

Back in the chapel from the morbid night.
You wake and depression crawl on your neck
I bite your heart forever with poison
Until you become what my plan require

A priest became a puppet of Satan
New prayers will praise Hell instead.
Wine changed for weird opium and alcohol.
Let the congregation begin.

Blind sheep follow you as always.
But they know not of the difference.
From here the contamination must begin.
Worse than Black Death,the sinister breath.

No return,nothing to be saved of you.
I feel only pain in your existence
Forces sir and conjurations echo.
Chants of melancholic dreams.

In this forest of suicidal memories.
All the graves hold corpses that do not rot.
Hidden from the normal humans.
That would never understand...


1. The Dark Embrace

Hear the calling
The same call to darkness
I listened all those years ago
The path of hate and wisdom

In vain are you confused
Don't even try to understand
My way is with Satan
I have no heart for compassion

Resist the dark no more
A slave under his immortal will
Warmoon shining morbid
You must welcome the curse

Desecrate the creature of God
Ruin your life, care of none
I am a prophet slashing with his words
Bleed in enslavement obtained

Do you think you understand?
Wrong, there is no way
I see the life in your eyes
You must welcome the curse


2. The Crown of Burning Stars

This shining torch we carry
The bridge of status quo disappears behind us
An impulse to sublimination
The desire to embrace the divine within us

Summoning the fury of Chaos to find
The forbidden yet majestic fire which comes from below
The maze of doubts leading to knowledge
The one which destroys or exhilarates

Let this worship be like a thundering storm
Possessing yet unchaining the souls of thy disciples
Each new door is a key to this perilous realm
The burdens of what once was now lay in ruins before our eyes

Dare to revere adversity as much as triumph
Proudly forging and ferociously shapening the spirit

A monument to honour: the Promethean temple
To reach and receive the crown made of slamming stars
His glory is ours as he lives through us


1. Empire Of Suffering

Miserable creatures crawl
Hiding in the dark corridors
Hissing voices of hatred and despise
Pure feelings of eternal loath

Born under the blazing eye
Spawn of a putrid black womb
This, the empire of malevolence
Against the filth of creation

Signs of ominous forces
Inscripted on the crumbling stone
The shining iron pentagrams
Illuminate focused worshippers

Torrent of poisonous chants
Blood stains the ritual blade
Golden crosses turned to Hell
Horns against Heaven


2. A Spell To Awaken The Temple

Bathing in moonlight
I shiver and I tremble
Captured by the spell
Awakening this temple
My eyes turn to white
And breathing is broken
Dark powers taking vessel
Of my human token

As clouds are veiling
The moon of first frost
I gather my senses
Regaining what was lost
The pact I had made
Is signed and concealed
My soul is now branded
My true face revealed

To you our Father
I renew my black oath
Christ and his sheep
I curse and I loath
My black devotion
Your Jesus i despise
With this sign I announce
His utter demise


3. From The Black Coffin Lair

I uncover the black coffin
A dreamgate to the land of death
With blood I travel there
Drawing dark sigils

The night of my demise...
I gave my soul to Hell
Now I live among skulls and bones
In the land of death

Immortal in undeath
I live in the stench of a grave
Staring from the black earth
Among skeleton pieces

Drop me the taste of your blood
And i caress your dead bones
Cursed with me we are one
May we haunt in disguise

Tearing apart loved ones throats
From the rotten lair I was laid in
Blood soaks the black earth
Transforming lifeforce into a key


4. Burning Voice Of Adoration

Hail Satan - Hail Satan!!
Father of my flesh and soul
My voice burns in purity
Of praise and adoration

To you my hands are crossed
My face draped under this hood
Whatever your demands may be
I am at your service, lord

Whatever this dream called life
May offer in it's fading light
Only your wisdom will shine
A meaning to existence

Only in your presence is truth
Ultimately found in the end
I slash open the final gate
And fill this chalice of Hell...


5. Nocturnal Revelation

Once again the moon is glowing
Alone i walk into the night
Must rising from the damp fields
Silence in the darkness

To watch forever it's shining cold
Drinking blood like it was wine
To watch forever it's shining cold
Revelation of the goat is mine

Like the scourge it slashes
Freezing breath of evil winds
Kneeling at a pentagram of ashes
Of the burnt bible pages

My eyes lifted upon the light
In the nocturnal autumn sky
This chalice half empty now
Last words of black recitation

To watch forever it's shining cold
Drinking blood like it was wine
To watch forever it's shining cold
Revelation of the goat is mine

Shut the mouth of the priest
His lord has nothing on me
Devotion in black eternity
I worship Satan!!


6. Discovering The Enshrouded Eye

Ritual recitations are done
A cold current impales me
It's white fire engulfing my soul
In the death-womb of void

Discovering the sinister eye
Within enshrouded reaches
From one end to another end
Obscure chants are carried

In me the Devil lives on
Manifesting in my thoughts
Appearing in my passionate deeds
As a fist when i strike revenge

In glory for his eternal majesty
My voice is your voice
I am but a cup to be filled
With the wrath of Hell

Enlightened by the sinister eye
Within enshrouded reaches
From one end to another end
Obscure chants are carried


7. Let The Devil In

My dark promise to Hell
I will live in lust and hate
By heart devoted to crime
Against the coward god

I invert the cross of hope
And dwell in black despair
Every moment of every day
I'm blasphemy incarnate

Let the Devil in
Possessed...

No virtue undesecrated
No sin I did not taste
I imagine a life for Jesus
I'd rather take the rope


8. Sanguine Rituals

The flame of darkness and hate
Black token of forbidden art
Ashen walls and pitch-dark ceiling
In this ruin of monastery

Fornication of the evil ghosts
Sinister presence of ancient cold
The shadow in the coffin room
Eyes like burning pits of Hell

Rusty chains rattle in the night
When the vampyric moon is rising
Bloody rituals of black monarchy
Sanguine chalice filled

Immense decay and rotten air
Stench of death, of bones in piles
A throne adorned with skulls
In the gloom of candelabras light


9. Twilight Breath Of Satan

The freshly interred corpse
Greets with a rotten fragrance
Sweet scent of death and decay
Caressing the catacomb
Ghastly face of bone
Where her smile had been
Ravished while she lived
Desecrated in death

Twisted thoughts , necrolust
What she had best to offer
Is now but a blackened hole
No more pleasures of flesh
Sick memories are stirring
Through a black looking - glass
Deep in the demented mind
She still laughs with joy

One final graven kiss
From her imaginary lips
Tormented chattering
Echoes in the dark
Her bones and a shotgun
Laid on the wooden table
Both barrels full of Satan's breath
For the last twilight rite


10. As Darkness Tears The World Apart

Come hail and fire, raping the world
Come reap with desire
To chaos are we hurled
Stars will fall with blackest death
Carnage of all, worms in your breath

People swarm in their despair
Bloody limbs cut everywhere
Darkness tears with greedy claws
As nigh their final hour draws

Washed away - with decay
Failing flesh
Torn apart - heart by heart
Death so fresh
Wiped away - no more prey
All is dead
Soul by soul - this hellhole
A void instead

Ash and lava, poison fumes
In each direction perdition looms
Last of prayers heard above by none
Glory to Satan, gods become one


1. Nightmares And Necromancy

I dig my hands in the soil
Of an open old grave
Feeling the bone against my fingers
I raise an item of beauty

Staring at empty sockets
A grin of bone, jaw unattached
I wipe the dirt away
And kiss the infant skull

So close in my dreams
But this is reality
And no dream can overcome
This mental orgasm

The rest of your lovely bones
Obsess me to make love
In a morbid office to Satan
Serve the demonic host

Stench of rotten blood
From the black urns
Nightmares and pestilence
The face of the king!


2. The Moon Growing Colder

The old moon over this Empire
Is growing colder and colder
The Sargeist night spirit howls
Calling, surpassing distances

Remembering places, and pain
The shivering voice of my heart
It knows that silence waits...
Confined to nourish thirsty roots

From this cursed and fruitless soil
The trees of misery will sprout
Their rotten leaves forever chanting
A whisper of darkness and decay

The old moon over this Empire
Is growing colder and colder
The old moon over this Empire
Shining on my scattered bones


1. Feeding The Crawling Shadows

Endlessly crawling chaos
A black quivering mass
Behind these dirty walls
Relentless whispering
Eyes burning with hatred
Hundreds of them staring
Diseased little beings
Of unknown origin

Waiting and waiting and waiting
Whomever finds they way
Within these abandoned rooms
Of a chapel that was
Tempted into sneaking in
With a hope to find the tome
But what you founds was death
Painful and unclean

Drank clean from all the blood
Your organs their feast
Bones stripped of flesh
This place your tomb


2. In Charnel Dreams

Something rotten lays beneath
The chilling earthen floor
As if the stench has carried
With it some distant song

In the mourning tome of violins
Dissonate and invoking
Calling forth terrible dreams
From unknown planes

Visions of terror entwine
With darkenend reality
From charnel hallways
Come the glowing mists...

Creeping through the windows
Seeping through the stone
Walls begin to bleed
And the violins go insane

Heat of lava, cold of space
Eyes sewn shut to see
The wounds with dreams
The witch unveiled

One by one they are cut
Strings of the devil's harp
Morbid silence falls
And only death awaits


3. Unto The Undead Temple

So it befalls us
Unto the Undead Temple
To carry on the torch
As His chosen mouth

Ever to exalt and glorify
With a stern command
The master of all things
Veiled and obscure

Ours is to wield
The unchained with magick
In which all the forms of
His divine wrath manifests

And to be forever ordained
In dead congregation
As must the serpent ever
Shed it's skin

Unto us the glorious conquest
In spirit as in flesh
To feed upon the carnage
And feast upon your souls

As the winged beast of night
Against the doves
Ours is the right
To pick clean your bones

As reapers we come and reap we shall
For who is more ignorant in his stand
The man who can not define lightning
Or the man who does not respect it?


4. Snares Of Impurity

Priests are weeping
Young women are raped
You recall the good life
That once was yours
Your places of worship
Are abodes of suffering
Left in a shock of constant pain
with fire burning in your bones

Thirst so fierce that your tongues
Are stuck to the roof of the mouth
Weight of guilt tied around your neck
Is draining all your strength
Children die in their mother's arms
This is the day we've waited for
Sking and flesh wasting away
Where no light would return

Impure flames burn in the temples
On crumbling abandoned altars
Snares of deathand damnation
Consuming all in their way
Priests have died unpeacefully
While searching for mercy
All hope is lost
All hope is lost


5. Return Of The Rats

I am the coffin spirit
Old ghost of vengeance
Cold may be my bones
Long since decayed my heart
Still here in this crypt
My cursed being bound
Not even rats have returned
Since many centuries

But soon i will again
Have their hungry company
Foolish humans have come
To try and rob my graves
Let them enter my darkness
And break the seal
My blades thirst for blood
For it is near...

So their fortune seeking
Became my rarest joy
Corpses of thieves a fest
For the rats have returned...


6. The Unspoken Ones

Gigantic carvings
Of the Other gods
In the mountainside
Of this waking world
A cold, darkened land
Full of steep black ridges...
Beyond which nothing
Is visible but the sky

Moon is waxing gibbous,
Two nights before it's full
The dreadful carvings glow
Under the moon's old eye

Come night, pitch-black darkenss!
Horns concealed by the shadows...
Howling of the nameless beings
Across the cemetery fields...

Black beings rise again
From their hidden nests..
The ones no one speak of,
The ones no one know

Come night, pitch-black darkenss!
Horns concealed by the shadows...
Howling of the nameless beings
Across the cemetery fields...


7. The Shunned Angel

Legacy of your creator
Made you blind to the world
To think the only purpose to exist
Is to wither in his spiritless light

All the days accounted for
Seeking the love of thy father
Ensured of your greatest illusion
The heavenly paradise

Embrace the Shunned One
First angel of true knowledge
The one your jealous creator
Thought to have beaten

Pray for the true power
Which shall awaken the soul
And open His dark kingdom
Which lies deep in your heart

For it is prince Lucifer
Nay, the uncrowned King!
Who guides man with wisdom
And secrets of the ancient art

Hail Satan - the adversary!
First to question god's folly
For thiss is the righteous path
The gospel of truth!


8. Inside The Demon's Maze

Inside te demon's maze
Trapped in the void that is known
To exist between life and death
Where no common soul can dwell

Where winds forever blow
Only from the north
And each sign carved in stone
Is an epitaph

Inside the demon's maze
Searching for the gate
Accompanied only by despair
And the mad flutes tone

Followed not by the shadow of being
But by a being of the shadow
Unable to defeat life or reach death
In the cursed eternity


9. Kingdom Below

Waking from a dream
In the middle of the night
Glow of the frozen moon
Gently caressing my face
Hearing voices from afar
Beginning to chant

I rise from the resting place
Only to realize my feet
The decaying ground
I look and see above me
Nothing but murky soil
Yet beneath me i see
The starless sky ablaze

As above so below
Yet everything here is twisted
A tormented netherworld
Filled with agonizing terror
Crowned with my own entrails
A morbid king i am made

Pillars rise with corpses piled
In monumental worship
Of all thet which must die
Chilling winds attempting to sing
Yet only wails emerge
Crashing at my maddening senses
Do not touch the familiar floor
Something cold and slimy
Reaching ot for me
Stench of Mala Fide

Hands pulling me underneath
Below


10. Funerary Descent

The sinister witch-fires gleam
Against a sky swirling out of form
Embracing the Undead Temple
Have their bleak flames flicered

Casting no living shadows
To remind of a natural place
To dance upon the walls and ground
Or to draw but nightmarish figures

Funerary worshippers crawling
Almost as a heap of flesh
Into the postal chambers
Enshrined with ancient symbols

To descend unto Black Earth
Where bones adorn all
Neither dead or with beating hearts
Are they, called by His voice

Gathering of hopeless souls
No longer able to flee
Flocking onwards
Down there where madness dwells

in the city of eternal death
In the shadow of the howling ziggurats
